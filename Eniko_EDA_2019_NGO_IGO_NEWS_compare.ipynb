      "Approach 1: Represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality.\n",
      "Approach 2: The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both the net losses or gains in the area of specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category). Thus, Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but is still only tracking those changes without spatially-explicit location data, often based on political boundaries (i.e., locations of specific land-use and land-use conversions are not known).\n",
      "Approach 3: The key defining characteristic of Approach 3 is that it is both spatially and temporally consistent and explicit.

      "Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by countries in inventories are comparable among countries. For this purpose, countries should use agreed methodologies and formats for estimating and reporting inventories.\n",
      "Completeness\n",
      "Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines for the full geographic coverage in addition to other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specific to individual countries (and therefore may not be included in the IPCC Guidelines).\n",
      "Confidence\n",
      "The term âconfidenceâ is used to represent trust in a measurement or estimate. Having confidence in inventory estimates does not make those estimates more accurate or precise; however, it will eventually help to establish a consensus regarding whether the data can be applied to solve a problem. This usage of confidence differs substantially from the statistical usage in the term confidence interval.\n",
      "Confidence interval\n",
      "A confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed/estimated data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval. Most commonly, the 95 per cent confidence level is used.\n",
      "Consistency\n",
      "Consistency means that an inventory is internally consistent in all its elements over a period of years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base year and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. An inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been estimated in a transparent manner taking into account the guidance in Volume 1 on good practice in time series consistency.\n",

      "Degassing emissions\n",
      "Elevated gas emissions that occur as water is released from a dam and experiences sudden changes in pressure, temperature and turbulence. These changes cause air-water exchange processes to occur at much greater rates than in surface waters as the released water approaches a new equilibrium with the environment downstream following Le Chatelier's principle. In the case of dams the change in the hydrostatic pressure before and after water passing through turbines affects this balance.\n",
      "Also, water released from dams is typically released into a stilling basin designed to dissipate much of the turbulent energy of the flow in order to prevent excessive bank erosion in the natural river channel downstream. The increased water column turbulence greatly increases the air-water gas transfer rate for a given dissolved gas concentration. In some cases, water may be discharged through needle valves into the air, which provides very high air-water contact area leading to rapid gas release.\n",

      "\"Good practice\" is a key concept for inventory compilers to follow in preparing national greenhouse gas inventories. The key concept does not change in the 2019 Refinement. The term \"good practice\" has been defined, since 2000 when this concept was introduced2, as \"a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced so far as practicable\". This definition has gained general acceptance amongst countries as the basis for inventory development and its centrality has been retained for the 2019 Refinement. Certain terms in the definition have been updated based on feedback from the statistics community, such that this definition can be also understood as \"a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that they are precise so far as practicable\" in the context of refinement of Chapter 3 of Volume 13.\n",

      "Monte Carlo method\n",
      "In these Guidelines a Monte Carlo method is recommended to analyse the uncertainty of the inventory. The principle of Monte Carlo analysis is to perform the inventory calculation many times by computer, each time with the uncertain emission factors or model parameters and activity data chosen randomly (by the computer) within the distribution on uncertainties specified initially by the user. Uncertainties in emission factors and/or activity data are often large and may not have normal distributions. In this case the conventional statistical rules for combining uncertainties become very approximate.

      "The thin boundary layer model expresses the flux of gas across an air-water interface as the product of a gas transfer velocity and the concentration change across the interface. It was originally developed by Liss and Slater (1974).\n",
      "Tier\n",
      "A tier represents a level of methodological complexity. Usually three tiers are provided. Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2 intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are sometimes referred to as higher tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate.\n",
      "Time series\n",
      "A time series is series of values which are affected by random processes and which are observed at successive (usually equidistant) points in time.\n",
      "Transparency\n",
      "Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information.\n",
      "Trend\n",
      "The trend of a quantity measures its change over a time period, with a positive trend value indicating growth in the quantity, and a negative value indicating a decrease. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the quantity over the time period, divided by the initial value of the quantity, and is usually expressed either as a percentage or a fraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trophic state\n",
      "A measure of the biological productivity of a water body. It is usually characterized by some combination of nutrients, photosynthetic pigments (Chl-a) and/or water column optical properties. As the ambient nutrient levels increase, primary production (the algal population) increases and the water clarity decreases. As primary production increases, higher levels of biological production are supported and the trophic state increases.\n",
      "Lakes or reservoirs are usually classified as being in one of four possible trophic states: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, or hypereutrophic. (see e.g., Carlson, 1977)\n",
      "Oligotrophic: an oligotrophic lake or reservoir is characterised by low primary productivity, as a result of low nutrient content. (Chl-a â¤ 2.6 Î¼g L-1.)\n",
      "Mesotrophic: mesotrophic lakes or reservoirs are characterised with an intermediate level of productivity (2.6 Î¼g L-1 < Chl-a â¤ 20 Î¼g L-1.)\n",
      "Eutrophic: a eutrophic lake, pond or reservoir with high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. (20 Î¼g L-1 < Chl-a â¤ 56 Î¼g L-1.)\n",
      "Hypereutrophic: a hypereutrophic body of water experiences the highest levels of biological productivity. (56 Î¼g L-1 < Chl-a)\n",
      "Tropical, dry climate\n",
      "Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation less than or equal to 1000mm.\n",
      "Tropical, moist climate\n",
      "Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation greater than 1000mm and less than or equal to 2000mm.\n",
      "Tropical montane climate\n",
      "Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and an elevation greater than 1000m.\n",
      "Tropical, wet climate\n",
      "Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation greater than 2000mm.\n",
      "Unbiased estimator\n",
      "An unbiased estimator is a statistic whose expected value equals the value of the parameter being estimated. Note that this term has a specific statistical meaning and that an estimate of a quantity calculated from an unbiased estimator may lack bias in the statistical sense, but may be biased in the more general sense of the word if the sample has been affected by unknown systematic error. Thus, in statistical usage, a biased estimator can be understood as a deficiency in the statistical evaluation of the collected data, and not in the data themselves or in the method of their measurement or collection. For example, the arithmetic mean (average) x is an unbiased estimator of the expected value (mean).\n",
      "Uncertainty\n",
      "Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a probability density function characterizing the range and likelihood of possible values. Uncertainty depends on the analystâs state of knowledge, which in turn depends on the quality and quantity of applicable data as well as knowledge of underlying processes and inference methods. (See Volume 1 Chapter 3.)\n",
      "Uncertainty analysis\n",
      "An uncertainty analysis of a model aims to provide quantitative measures of the uncertainty of output values caused by uncertainties in the model itself and in its input values, and to examine the relative importance of these factors.\n",
      "Validation\n",
      "Validation is the establishment of sound approach and foundation. In the context of emission inventories, validation involves checking to ensure that the inventory has been compiled correctly in line with reporting instructions and guidelines. It checks the internal consistency of the inventory. The legal use of validation is to give an official confirmation or approval of an act or product.\n",
      " G.19\n",
      "Variability\n",
      "This refers to observed differences attributable to true heterogeneity or diversity in a population. Variability derives from processes which are either inherently random or whose nature and effects are influential but unknown. Variability is not usually reducible by further measurement or study, but can be characterised by quantities such as the sample variance.\n",
      "Verification\n",
      "Verification refers to the collection of activities and procedures that can be followed during the planning and development, or after completion of an inventory that can help to establish its reliability for the intended applications of that inventory.\n",
      "Typically, methods external to the inventory are used to check the truth of the inventory, including comparisons with estimates made by other bodies or with emission and uptake measurements determined from atmospheric concentrations or concentration gradients of these gases.\n",
      "Watercourse\n",
      "The channel that a flowing body of water follows.\n",
      "Water residence time\n",
      "The average amount of time that water spends in a particular system (lake, reservoir, etc.). Defined as the volume of the reservoir divided by the inflow.\n",
      "Water withdrawal\n",
      "The controlled release of water from a dam. Depending on the damâs design, i.e. the number and level of discrete outlets, the withdrawn water may originate solely from specific regions of the water column, i.e. epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion. The withdrawal region for a specific discharge depends strongly on the density stratification of the water body, the outlet dimensions, and the reservoir morphology.\n",
      "Wetlands\n",
      "This category includes land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., peatland) and that does not fall into the forest land, cropland, grassland or settlements categories. The category can be subdivided into managed and unmanaged according to national definitions. Wetlands occur over all climate zones and include reservoirs and other constructed waterbodies (e.g. agriculture and aquaculture ponds, canals and ditches and wetlands constructed for wastewater treatment) as managed sub-divisions. Managed wetlands may also include peatlands, riparian wetlands, forested swamps, marshes, playas, pans, salt lakes, brackish wetlands, salinas, and sabkhas, in addition to coastal wetlands, including mangroves, saltmarshes, tidal marshes and seagrass. Unmanaged wetlands include natural rivers, lakes and ponds and any wetlands that have not been directly modified by human activity based on the Managed Land Proxy.AI Annex I: Glossary\n",

      "Startup Box | The Importance of the Ocean and Cryosphere for People\n",
      "All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71 % of the Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth's water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system1. Around 10% of Earth's land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1,1.2}\n",
      "Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains8 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone9 is currently home to around 680 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4-8.7% of the projected global population). {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}\n",
      "In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values, tourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1,1.2,1.5}\n",
      "                      |ce sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass (very high confidence). Between 2006 and 2015# the Greenland Ice Sheet9 lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 Â±11 Gtyr1 (equivalent to 0.77 Â± 0.03 mm yr1 of global sea level rise)10, mostly due to surface melting (high confidence).

RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of global warming. {Annex I: Glossary}\n",

By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions.

      "The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), focusing on the theme \"healthy planet, healthy people\", aims to help policymakers and all of society achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, internationally agreed environmental goals and the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analyzing current and past environmental policy, and identifying future options for achieving sustainable development by 2050.\n",
      "The original request to prepare GEO-6 came from Member states at the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), when, in paragraph 8 of resolution 1/4, the Executive Director of UNEP was requested, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook, supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global, intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNEP/EA.1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer-reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policymakers, to be endorsed by the Environment Assembly no later than in 2018.\n",
      "At its third session, the Environment Assembly, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of its decision 3/1, requested the Executive Directorio issue the sixth Global Environment Outlook at least three months before the fourth session of the Assembly; to schedule the negotiations on the Summary for policymakers at least six weeks in advance of the fourth session of the Assembly; and to present the Outlook and the Summary for consideration and possible endorsement by the Assembly at its fourth session.\n",

      "Scope\n",
      "GEO-6 builds on previous GEO reports and continues to provide an analysis of the state of the global environment, the global, regional and national policy response as well as the outlook for the foreseeable future. It differs from previous GEO reports in its emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals and in providing possible means of accelerating achievement of these goals. GEO- 6 is made up of four distinct but closely linked parts.\n",
      "â Part A assesses the state of the global environment in relation to key internationally agreed goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "â Part B provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the policy response to these environmental challenges.\n",
      "â Part C reviews the scenarios literature and assesses pathways towards achieving Agenda 2030 as well as achieving a truly sustainable world in 2050.\n",
      "â Part D identifies future data and knowledge necessary to improve our ability to assess environmental impacts.\n",
      "The GEO-6 also considers key policy questions. These include:\n",
      "â What are the primary drivers of environmental change?\n",
      "â \n",
      "What is the current state of the environment and why?\n",
      "â How successful have we been in achieving our internationally agreed environmental goals?\n",

      "â Is the current policy response enough?\n",
      "â What are the business as usual scenarios and what does a sustainable future look like?\n",
      "â What are the emerging issues and megatrends including their possible impacts?\n",
      "â What are the possible pathways to achieving Agenda 2030 and other internationally agreed environmental goals?\n",
      "The development of GEO-6 involved extensive collaboration both within UN Environment and between UN Environment and a network of multidisciplinary experts and research institutions.\n",
      "The intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation mentioned above (Oct. 2014) requested that experts for content development, including reviewers and advisory groups, be nominated by governments and other main stakeholders based on their expertise and using a transparent nomination process while considering geographic and gender balance.\n",
      "The following three GEO-6 specialized advisory bodies were convened to support the assessment process:\n",
      "High-Level Intergovernmental and Stakeholder Advisory Group\n",
      "The panel included 25-30 high-level government representatives from all six UN Environment regions as well as 8-10 key stakeholders. The High-level Group provided strategic advice and initial guidance on the structure and content of the GEO-6 Summary for Policymakers and further guidance to the experts in finalizing the draft Summary, in preparation for the final intergovernmental negotiation.\n",
      "Science Advisory Panel\n",
      "The Panel included 22 distinguished scientists who met face to- face five times. The Panel was responsible for providing advice on the scientific credibility of the assessment process. The Panel provided scientific advice; standards and guidelines for the assessment and review process; and reviewed the findings of the mid-term evaluation of the assessment process.\n",
      "Assessment Methodologies, Data and Information Working Group\n",
      "This working group of 12 professionals met face-to-face three times between 2015 and 2018 and provided support and guidance to the assessment process on the use of core datasets and indicators.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) is the result of a consultative and participatory process to prepare an independent assessment of the state of the environment, the effectiveness of the policy response in addressing environmental challenges and the possible pathways to achieving various internationally agreed environmental goals. The GEO is a series of studies that inform environmental decision-making for Governments and other stakeholders. {1.1}\n",
      "The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), under the theme \"Healthy Planet, Healthy People\", aims to provide a sound, evidence-based source of environmental information to help policymakers and all of society to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals, and to implement the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analysing current and past environmental policies and identifying future options to achieve sustainable development by 2050. {1.1}\n",
      "Since the first edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) in 1997, there have been many examples of environmental improvement, especially where problems have been well- identified, manageable, and where regulatory and technological solutions have been readily available. Much more can be achieved in that regard through more effective implementation of existing policies. {Chapters 12 to 17}\n",
      "Nevertheless, the overall condition of the global environment has continued to deteriorate since the first edition of GEO, despite environmental policy efforts across all countries and regions. Environmental policy efforts are being hindered by a variety of factors, in particular unsustainable production and consumption- patterns in most countries and climate change. GEO-6 concludes that unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society. {Chapters 4 to 9}\n",
      "Urgent action at an unprecedented scale is necessary to arrest and reverse this situation, thereby protecting human and environmental health and maintaining the current and future integrity of global ecosystems. Key actions include reducing land degradation, biodiversity loss, and air, land and water pollution; improving water management and resource management; climate change mitigation and adaptation; resource efficiency; addressing decarbonization, decoupling and detoxification; and the prevention and management of risk and disasters. Those all require more ambitious and effective policies, including sustainable consumption and production, greater resource efficiency and improved resource management, integrated ecosystem management, and integrated waste management and prevention.1 2 3 4 {Chapter 22}\n",
      "\n",
      "Mainstreaming environmental considerations into social and economic decisions at all levels is of vital importance. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, GEO-6 shows that environmental issues are best addressed in conjunction with related economic and social issues, taking into account synergies and trade-offs between different goals and targets, including consideration of eguity and gender dimensions. Governance can be improved at the local, national, regional and global levels, including broad coordination between policy areas. More ambitious and effectively implemented environmental policies are necessary, but alone they are not sufficient to meet sustainable development objectives. At the same time as ensuring sustainable sources of financing for sustainable development and aligning financing flows with environmental priorities, capacities have to be strengthened and scientific information taken into account for environmental management. Strong commitment from all stakeholders, partnerships and international cooperation would greatly facilitate the realization of environmental goals.\n",
      "{Chapters 22, 23, 24}\n",
      "GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is the best foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being. As figure SPM.1 illustrates, human behaviour has had various impacts on biodiversity, atmosphere, oceans, water and land.\n",
      "That environmental degradation, which ranges from serious to irreversible, has had a negative impact on human health. Atmospheric pollution has had the most severe negative impact, followed by degradation of water, biodiversity, ocean and land environment. It is therefore important that opportunities for prosperity and well-being that maintain or regain the integrity of ecosystems should be attained through sustainable development pathways that are shared and pursued globally. {24.4}\n",
      "The following sections highlight the main global drivers of environmental change, the condition of the environment, the scale and effectiveness of policy responses, the potential pathways for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in an increasingly complex world, and the data and information needs and opportunities that can support decision-making towards achieving those Goals.\n",

      "Note: The figure shows the degree of impact of human activity on the health of the planet (ranging from good health to irreversible damage) and the impact of the health of the planet on human health (ranging from low damage to high damage). Some environmental and health impact may be remediable in the short or long term, but \"irreversible\" environmental impact can only be remedied over the very long term, if at all.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 Drivers of environmental change, megatrends and governance challenges\n",
      "Human population dynamics or trends, particularly population pressure, and economic development have been acknowledged for many decades as the primary drivers of environmental change (well established). More recently, rapid urbanization and accelerating technological innovation have been additional influences. There are wide disparities globally in the consumption and production patterns that lie behind those drivers. {2.1.1,2.2}\n",
      "Those driving forces are also strongly intertwined, complex, and spread widely and unevenly across the world (well established). They are megatrends, developing at speeds with which responses by established governance structures at all levels - urban and rural, local, national, regional, global and supranational - are thus far insufficient to keep pace. {2.1.1}\n",
      "The global population in 2018 is some 7.5 billion, with median projections estimating nearly 10 billion by 2050 and nearly 11 billion by 2100 (United Nations figures) (well established). Increases in life expectancy and reductions in infant and other mortality mean that population growth rates will continue to remain positive in all regions except Europe and certain parts of Asia. Unequal access to education, and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, all contribute to high birth rates. Without changes in production and consumption patterns, population growth will continue to increase environmental pressures. {2.3, 2.3.4, 2.1.1}\n",
      "Urbanization is happening at an unprecedented rate globally and cities have become the foremost drivers of economic development across the world (well established). More people, especially in emerging and developing economies, are living in cities and towns, and the world's urban population is expected to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 (well established). Approximately 90 per cent of city growth will occur in Africa and Asia. Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing region, and is also the region expected to experience the highest population growth (well established). Some 30 per cent of urban residents globally have no access to basic services or social protection, with poor women in low-income urban neighbourhoods being particularly vulnerable. {2.4, 2.4.3}\n",
      "Almost all coastal cities of any size and small island developing States are increasingly vulnerable to rising sea-levels, floods and storm surges caused by climate change and extreme weather events (established but incomplete). In general, those cities in developing countries that are urbanizing most rapidly are in a more vulnerable situation. In contrast, sustainable urbanization can represent an opportunity to increase citizens' well-being while decreasing their environmental impact. Lower- impact urban lifestyles can be facilitated by improved governance, infrastructure, services, sustainable land-use planning and technological opportunities. Investment in rural areas can reduce pressure to migrate. {2.4.4,17.3}\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic development has lifted billions of people out of poverty and enhanced access to health and education in most regions of the world (well established). Nevertheless, the \"Grow now, clean up later\" economic approach used in certain regions has not accounted for climate change, pollution or degraded natural systems. That approach has also contributed to increasing inequality within and between countries and will ultimately be more costly. It will not be able to sustainably support 10 billion healthy, fulfilled and productive people in 2050 without profound and urgent changes in consumption and production patterns. {2.5.1}\n",
      "Decoupling of environmental degradation and resource use from economic growth and associated production and consumption patterns is required for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (well established). Partial decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth can already be observed for some impacts and resources in certain countries. Further decoupling reguires the scaling-up of existing sustainable practices and more fundamental transitions in the ways in which we produce, consume and dispose of goods and materials across society. Those transitions are likely to be more effective if supported by long-term, comprehensive, science- based targets that provide the objective basis for future directions and actions. {2.5.1}\n",
      "The growth in technological innovation since the 1990s has been unprecedented, both globally and historically, bringing many benefits to people's lives, but has also had some negative consequences (established but incomplete). Some technological and social innovations can reduce the environmental pressures associated with unsustainable consumption and production. Enhancing access to existing environmental technologies that are adapted to domestic circumstances could help countries to achieve environmental objectives more quickly. Application of precautionary approaches, according to international agreements (where applicable), to new technological innovations can reduce unintended negative consequences for human and ecosystem health. {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4}\n",
      "Countries that prioritize low-carbon, resource-efficient practices may gain a competitive advantage in the global economy (established but incomplete). Well-designed environmental policies and appropriate technologies and products can often be implemented in tandem at limited or no cost to growth and competitiveness and can expand the capacity of countries to develop and diffuse innovative technologies. That may be positive for employment and development, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, facilitating sustainable development (established but incomplete). {2.5.1}\n",
      "Climate change is a priority issue affecting both human systems, including human health, and natural systems - air, biological diversity, freshwater, oceans and land - and which alters the complex interactions between those systems (well established). Historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions have committed the world to an extended period of climate change (well established), which is leading to global warming of air and ocean; rising sea-levels; melting glaciers, permafrost and Arctic sea ice; changes in carbon, biogeochemical and global water cycles; food security crises; fresh water scarcity; and more frequent and extreme weather events. Higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide also lead to ocean acidification and affect the composition, structure and functionality of ecosystems. Time is running out to prevent irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are radically reduced, the world is on course to exceed the temperature threshold set out in the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That makes climate change a global driver of environmental, social, health and economic impact and heightened society-wide risks. {2.7.3}\n",
      "Society-wide risks associated with environmental degradation and climate change effects are generally more profound for people in a disadvantaged situation, particularly women and children in developing countries (established but incomplete). Many of the impacts outlined above are serious or irreversible and may lead to loss of livelihood, increased morbidity and mortality, and economic slowdown, and have greater potential for violent conflict, human mass migration and decreasing social resilience. Measures for more effective adaptation are now urgently required, especially for populations and regions which are in a vulnerable situation. {2.7.3}\n",
      "The increasing scale, global reach and speed of change in those drivers of environmental change pose urgent challenges for managing environmental and climate change problems\n",
      "(well established). In many domains, our scientific understanding of adverse, increasingly high impact is becoming more widespread, as is the understanding that the nature of change may sometimes be irreversible. The thematic priorities addressed by GEO-6 have been chosen and analysed with that context in mind and the summaries by theme have been organized to provide decision-makers with the most crucial insights within themes, including links to drivers and optional avenues for action. {2.7.3}\n",

      "2.2 The state of the environment\n",
      "2.2.1 Air\n",
      "\n",
      "Emissions generated by human activity continue to alter the composition of the atmosphere, leading to air pollution, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and exposure to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (well established). {5.3}\n",
      "Air pollution is the main environmental contributor to the global burden of disease, leading to between 6 million and 7 million premature deaths (well established) and welfare losses estimated at US$5 trillion annually (established but incomplete). Air pollution exposure, especially to fine particulate matter, is highest for urban residents in some countries with rapid urbanization trends (established but incomplete) and for the approximately 3 billion people who depend on burning fuels such as wood, coal, crop residue, dung and kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting (well established). The elderly, very young, ill and poor are more susceptible to the impact of air pollution (well established).\n",
      "{5.2.4, 5.4.1}\n",
      "Globally, decreasing emission trends from local air pollutants in certain sectors and regions have been offset by larger increases in others, including some rapidly developing countries and areas of rapid urbanization (well established). Available data indicate that emissions decrease significantly when regulations are put in place. {5.2} International agreements have been successful in addressing specific chemicals. Both improvement of energy efficiency and pollution control techniques may be used to achieve lower air pollutant emissions. As controls have been placed on power plants, large industrial facilities and vehicles, the relative contribution of other sources, including agriculture, domestic fuel use, construction and other portable equipment, and forest or open fires, has grown in importance (established). Electricity generated from non-renewable resources and the fossil fuel production and consumption sectors (\"energy\") is the largest anthropogenic emitting sector of S02 and non-methane volatile organic compounds and the main emitting sector of other air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.\n",
      "Global increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have taken place in many parts of the world. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in C02 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases continue to increase, driven primarily by fossil fuel extraction and use for electricity generation, industry and transport, although they are also affected by land use, land-use change, agriculture and forestry (well established). The evidence of current global climate change is unequivocal (well established). Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has increased by between approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius and 1.2 degrees Celsius (very likely). Eight of the ten warmest years on record have occurred within the past decade (virtually certain). If greenhouse gas emissions persist, global average temperatures will continue to increase at the current rate, crossing the temperature target agreed as part of the Paris Agreement between 2030 and 2052 (very likely). The Paris Agreement committed countries to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that doing so would significantly reduce the risks and impact of climate change. Current nationally determined contributions, presented in Paris in 2015, constitute only one third of the mitigation required to establish a least- cost pathway for staying well below 2 degrees Celsius (well established). {2.2, 2.7, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.3.4} To maintain a good chance of remaining well below a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, emissions need to drop by between 40 and 70 per cent globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to net zero by 2070.\n",
      "{2.7.4}\n",
      "Achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires transformational changes leading to deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of emission sources and sinks (established but incomplete). In addition to emissions reductions for C02 the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (also called forcers), specifically black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons, provide opportunities to limit warming in the short term and are a critical component of an integrated climate change mitigation and air-quality management programme. However, since long-lived greenhouse gases dominate climate forcing in the long term, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants in the short term needs to be combined with mitigation of long-term greenhouse gases.\n",
      "(well established). {4.2.1, 5.3.4} Non-C02 emissions in pathways that limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius show deep reductions that are similar to those in pathways limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "Government capacity and political will to manage air pollution and climate change varies significantly (well established).\n",
      "Some regions have well-developed systems of national-to-local policies and compliance and enforcement programmes (well established), although ambition levels in terms of both scope and policy may differ. In other regions, international agreements or national legislation may exist, but implementation and compliance and enforcement are often affected by weak national-to-local institutional capacity (established but incomplete). Future policy efforts can build upon renewed attention to those issues in international forums and several decades of experience with various governance strategies in different countries. Between 1998 and 2010, there was a five-fold increase in the number of national climate laws (more than 1,500 laws and policies worldwide) and by 2012 those laws covered 67 per cent of all emissions (well established). Some city and subnational governments are leading the way with benefits for other parts of their countries (well established). {5.4, 5.5,12}\n",

      "2.2.2 Biodiversity\n",
      "A major species extinction event, compromising planetary integrity and Earth's capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding. Biodiversity refers to the diversity of living things at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels. It helps to regulate climate, filters air and water, enables soil formation and mitigates the impact of natural disasters. It also provides timber, fish, crops, pollination, ecotourism, medicines, and physical and mental health benefits (well established). {6.1,6.4.2}\n",
      "\n",
      "Environmental and human health are intricately intertwined, and many emerging infectious diseases are driven by activities that affect biodiversity (established but incomplete). Changes to the landscape (through natural resource extraction and use, for example) can facilitate disease emergence in wildlife, domestic animals, plants and people. Zoonoses are estimated to account for more than 60 per cent of human infectious diseases. {6.1, 13.1; boxes 6.1,13.1}\n",
      "Genetic diversity is declining, threatening food security and the resilience of ecosystems, including agricultural systems and food security (well established). {6.5.1}\n",
      "Populations of species are declining and species extinction rates are increasing. At present, 42 per cent of terrestrial invertebrates, 34 per cent of freshwater invertebrates and 25 per cent of marine invertebrates are considered at risk of extinction. Between 1970 and 2014, global vertebrate species population abundances declined by on average 60 per cent (well established). Steep declines in pollinator abundance have also been documented. {6.5.2}\n",
      "Ecosystem integrity and functions are declining. Ten out of every fourteen terrestrial habitats have seen a decrease in vegetation productivity and just under half of all terrestrial ecoregions are classified as having an unfavourable status (well established). {6.5.3}\n",
      "Native and non-native invasive species threaten ecosystems, habitats and other species. The economic costs, both direct and indirect, amount to many billions of dollars annually. {6.4.2}\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Biodiversity loss is also an equity issue, disproportionately affecting poorer people, women and children. If current rates of decline continue, future generations will be deprived of the health benefits of biodiversity. The livelihoods of 70 per cent of people living in poverty directly depend on natural resources (well established). {6.1,6.6.5; boxes 6.5,13.2}\n",
      "The critical pressures on biodiversity are habitat change, loss and degradation; unsustainable agricultural practices; the spread of invasive species; pollution, including microplastics; and overexploitation, including illegal logging and trade in wildlife. Illegal trade in wildlife, fisheries and forest products is worth between US$90 billion and US$270 billion per annum. There is evidence to suggest that climate change will pose the gravest threat in the future, as species, including disease vectors, migrate with temperature shifts (well established). {6.5}\n",
      "Although governance efforts are progressing, greater efforts are required to achieve international objectives, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets within the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Over 190 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans have been submitted to the Convention, although their guality and reliability, as well their subseguent implementation, remains uneven; the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols to the Convention provide a deeper governance context. There is increasing international collaboration between various law enforcement authorities in combatting illegal wildlife trafficking. {Annex 6-1}\n",
      "The science-policy interface for biodiversity and the contribution that nature makes to people was strengthened in 2012 through the establishment of the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are negotiating the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Negotiations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea continue towards an agreement on the sustainable use and conservation of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction. {6.7.2, 6.7.4,13.1}\n",
      "Several multilateral environmental agreements provide additional governance architecture on biodiversity, including the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The continual updating of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and other independent monitoring efforts, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the consideration of the multiple values of biodiversity and the inclusion of the value of biodiversity in national economic valuation methods, will support and inform the implementation thereof. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to expand ecosystem assessments to better understand the global state of ecosystems and the trends therein. {6.5.3, 6.7.4, annexes 6.1 and 13.1}\n",
      "Protecting species and ecosystems requires conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources (well established). Species and ecosystems are most effectively safeguarded through the conservation of natural habitats (well established) and there is clear evidence that conservation can help to reduce biodiversity loss. Implementation, management and representative coverage of different ecosystems within protected areas remains insufficient. Less than 15 per cent of terrestrial habitats, including inland waters, and less than 16 per cent of coastal and marine areas within national jurisdiction are protected areas. {6.7.3}\n",
      "Biodiversity is slowly being mainstreamed or integrated into health, gender and other equity concerns through such efforts as the 2015-2020 Gender Plan of Action under the Convention on Biological Diversity and its relationship to the Convention's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020 and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (well established). Indigenous peoples and local communities play a key role in biodiversity protection by offering bottom-up, self-driven and innovative solutions, based on traditional knowledge and the ecosystem approach. However, protected areas can adversely affect indigenous communities if access to natural resources within protected areas is denied. {13.1}\n",
      "Ex situ conservation of genetic material provides safeguards for maintaining adaptive potential, in particular of crop and agricultural species. Gene banks and seed collections complement in situ conservation of genetic resources, yet the conservation status of genetic diversity for most wild species remains poorly documented. Yet accelerating biodiversity loss and the large, escalating costs of inaction, including numerous threats to human health, reguire an urgent increase in global investment in sustainable use and conservation, and the consistent integration of biodiversity concerns into all facets of economic and social development. {6.5.1,13.2.4}\n",
      "Greater focus on strengthening governance systems; improving policy frameworks through research; policy integration; implementation; and encouraging partnerships and participation, are all measures that have the potential to address the greatest pressures on biodiversity. Efforts to combat biodiversity loss must also address poverty eradication, food security challenges, gender inequality, systemic inefficiencies and corruption in governance structures and other social variables. Identification of the countries of origin of genetic resources, in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol thereto, will help to ensure progress against the objectives of those instruments and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the commercial utilization of those resources with such countries. {6.8}\n",

The main impacts of those drivers are marine ecosystem degradation and loss, including death of coral reefs (well established), reduced marine living resources and the resulting disturbance of marine and coastal ecosystem food chains (well established), increased nutrient and sediment run-off (well established) and marine litter (established but incomplete). Those impacts interact in ways that are just beginning to be understood and their interaction may amplify their effect (Inconclusive).

Current patterns of consumption, production and inequality are not sustainable, adding to other severe environmental pressures. Many environmental indicators are projected to move in the wrong direction. Projected population growth, urbanization trends and economic development will significantly increase demand for natural resources, such as food, energy and water, towards 2050. Under a business-as-usual scenario, resource efficiency in production and consumption, agricultural yields and nutrient use, water and energy efficiency are projected to increase, thereby partially offsetting demand for key environmental resources. However, such improvements will be inadequate to reduce the pressure on already-stressed environmental systems. {21.3.1â21.3.5}\n",
      "Indicators related to human development are projected to improve, but trends are insufficient to meet related targets (established but incomplete). Improvements are projected on global hunger, and access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and modern energy services, but significant inequality of access remains, and those improvements are not expected to take effect quickly enough for many countries to achieve the related Sustainable Development Goal targets. Preventable environment-related health risk factors are projected to remain prominent in 2030. Related global child mortality is projected to decrease, but not sufficiently for many developing countries to achieve the related Development Goal target, in particular in sub- Saharan Africa. Furthermore, air pollution is expected to continue to contribute to millions of premature deaths in the coming decades. {21.3.2, 21.3.3, 21.3.4, 21.3.6}\n",

Urgent action is now needed to reverse those trends and restore both environmental and human health to the planet (established but incomplete). Future projections show that development is either too slow to achieve the targets or even that it moves in the wrong direction (see figure SPM.8). Continuing failure to take urgent action is leading to ongoing and further potentially irreversible adverse impact, including on critical environmental resources and human health. {Section 2.2} Current patterns of consumption and production may be more expensive in the long term for many countries, as it often costs more to clean up later than it does to prevent damage now, added to which cleaning up later may not always be possible. For example, a further delay in climate action increases the cost of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, and at some point will make it impossible to achieve them.\n",

The literature includes many scenarios that provide information on the ways in which the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals can be achieved.\n",
      "Those pathways emphasize a number of key transitions in moving towards a healthy planet. They are associated with achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns for energy, food and water in order to provide universal access to those resources, while preventing climate change, air pollution, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, and overexploitation and pollution of oceans. They include changes in lifestyle, consumption preferences and consumer behaviour on the one hand, and cleaner production processes, resource efficiency and decoupling, corporate responsibility and compliance on the other hand. {22.3}\n",

They go beyond what can be achieved by environmental policies alone (established but incomplete). The rate of change in the pathways indicates that incremental environmental policies alone will not suffice. A mix of social and technological improvements and innovations is required, facilitated by effective policy measures and cooperation on a scale from the local to the international. {22.4.1}\n",
      "Meeting the targets related to climate change, reducing air pollution and providing sustainable energy for all is possible. Measures can be combined in different ways but need to be implemented rapidly and at an unprecedented scale (well established). It involves investment in energy access, enhancing the development and implementation of energy-efficiency improvements, lifestyle changes, a more rapid introduction of low greenhouse gas-emission technologies (including sustainable and eguitably-produced bioenergy, hydropower, solar, wind and carbon-capture-and-storage), air pollution control and reducing emissions and increasing removals from land use and land-use change and forestry of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (including non-C02 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture). Pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement are characterized by a reduction of carbon intensity in the global economy of 4 to 6 per cent per annum between now and 2050 (compared with 1 to 2 per cent per annum historically), which would reduce energy system greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050. {22.3.2}\n",
      "Eliminating hunger, preventing biodiversity loss and halting land degradation is possible by combining measures related to consumption, production, waste and redistribution of food, and nature conservation policies (established but incomplete). Scenarios achieving those social and environmental targets are typically characterized by a 50 per cent faster improvement in agricultural yields than a business-as-usual scenario, but depend heavily on changes on the consumption side and improvements in food distribution. Plaiting biodiversity loss would also require measures related to landscape management and protected areas. Ecological infrastructure can buffer farmers and rural and urban communities against climate shocks such as droughts and floods, mitigate water pollution and increase water supply, while at the same time protecting biodiversity. Sustainable agriculture also requires a reduction in the nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance to reduce pollution of freshwater systems, groundwater and coastal zones in oceans. Reducing water scarcity requires more efficient water use, increasing water storage and investing in desalination. Ambitious scenarios in the literature typically show higher water- use efficiency rates than in business-as-usual scenarios, but still fail to reach full water security. {22.3.1,22.3.3, 22.3.4}\n",
      "Synergies exist between specific measures and a broad range of sustainability targets, including measures related to education, promoting sustainable consumption, specifically a healthy diet and reducing air pollution (well established). Improved education, especially for women and girls, has a particularly strong connection with health outcomes, economic growth, reduced poverty and better environmental management. Meat products require more land than crops (see figure SPM.4). Therefore, promoting sustainable and healthy diets, reducing food waste in both developing and developed countries, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices would contribute towards meeting the nutritional needs of the 9-10 billion people projected to be on the planet in 2050. In doing so, synergies could be realized between improving health and nutrition, while reducing biodiversity loss, advancing habitat restoration and preventing land degradation and water scarcity. Phasing out the use of fossil fuels and moving towards lower-carbon-emission fuels, including sustainable bioenergy, would lead to important cobenefits, achieving both climate and air-quality targets, the latter also having synergies with improving human health, increasing agricultural production and reducing biodiversity loss. {22.4.2}\n",
      "There are also potential trade-offs between achieving different sustainability targets. Land-based climate change mitigation, namely bioenergy crop production, and agricultural intensification are key measures for achieving climate and food targets respectively, but could have significant detrimental effects on other environmental targets if not managed carefully (well established). While nearly all scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement rely on land-based mitigation measures, their use increases demand for land and could thus have a potentially massive influence on land-use patterns and eventually lead to higher food prices, which would in turn affect food security. Increasing agricultural yields would improve overall food availability and reduce pressure on natural land. Applying unsustainable agriculture practices could lead to land degradation, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. {22.4.2}\n",

That includes inclusive innovation, in which power and decision-making is relatively decentralized and externalities are internalized. Furthermore, such approaches can highlight gaps and blind spots in distributional equity, responsibility and capacity to address global environmental problems and their solutions. Participatory approaches can help to deliver context-relevant solutions. For example, decentralized renewable energy and microgrids fit neatly into many bottom-up sustainable visions that challenge traditionally modelled large- scale, centralized energy transitions. Accounting for regional differences, gender and other demographics are important for assessing and addressing problems, including the need for disaggregated data. Sustainable Development Goal policy design and implementation requires alignment of the collective wellbeing of actors from the local to other levels, taking into account in particular the needs of the vulnerable and most marginalized in society.

A healthy planet will result In people who live longer, healthier lives: nearly one quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations In a vulnerable situation and in developing countries. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets on hunger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services could reduce deaths in children under 5 related to malnutrition, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections by more than 400,000 per year by 2030. Furthermore, air pollution is the largest environmental health risk and is projected to continue to have significant negative effects on health, with scenario studies estimating between 4.5 million and 7 million premature deaths by mid-century under a business-as-usual scenario. Combined climate and air pollution policies could reduce those numbers significantly. {5.4.1, 21.3.3, 21.3.6, 22.3.2, 22.3.5, 23.12, 24.4}\n",

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, internationally agreed environmental goals and science-based targets will require an integrated approach that considers linkage across different environmental and non-environmental components, building upon disaggregated data generation and incorporating traditional knowledge and citizen science. Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets needs to be followed up upon and reviewed, using the global indicators, complemented by indicators at the national and regional levels, and work is needed to develop the baselines for those targets for which national and global baseline data do not yet exist. Integrated data and analysis can prioritize needs, shape effective policies and strengthen monitoring and evaluation outcomes. {3.1,25.1}\n",

Such gaps limit our capacity to formulate and implement policy solutions. More data will assist in linking people with the environment. Time series data is vitally important in that regard, as it forms the basis for monitoring change. Regular standardized data collection can be translated into statistics and indicators that highlight vulnerabilities within and between communities. Disaggregated data that captures information by gender, ethnicity, race, income, age and geographic region identify critical differences and promote effective policy design. {3.5, 3.7}\n",
      "In addition to filling knowledge gaps with new data, enormous gains can be made from consolidating, curating, harmonizing and increasing open access to existing data which are widely dispersed and cannot be easily combined or compared (well established). Common frameworks, initiatives and political will are needed to merge data sources and make better use of what is available. In that context, the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and the System of National Accounts are robust consensus statistical frameworks and methodological approaches that could be broadly adopted (see figure SPM.9). Rationalizing both existing and newly collected data is essential for the development of indicators. {3.3}\n",

A revolution in the quality and cost-effectiveness of Earth observation data means that indicators that can be measured remotely have far greater spatial coverage than those that cannot. For example, satellites can estimate deforestation and land use change with increasing accuracy, but cannot monitor all aspects of subsurface ocean environments. Data are particularly sparse for biodiversity, which is measured mostly by in situ observation and genetic analysis. Some freshwater components, such as groundwater and water use, are also data-deficient due to measurement challenges.

practices that take place on a delineated area over a given period of time.', 'Activity data\\nData on the magnitude of a human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time.', 'Data on energy use, metal production, land areas, management systems, lime and fertilizer use and waste arisings are examples of activity data.', 'Agricultural pond\\nAn artificial storage containing water for agricultural (irrigation) or pastoral (stock watering) uses.', 'They are typically unlined and constructed using a combination of earthen embankments and the natural

conditions (in landfills, flooded rice fields, etc.)', 'methane is likely to be formed.', 'Andosol\\nA soil developed in volcanic ash.', 'Generally andosols have good drainage and are prone to fertility problems.', 'Approaches to consistent representation of lands\\nApproach 1: Represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality.', 'Approach 2: The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both the net losses or gains in the area of specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category).', 'Thus, Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but is still only tracking those changes without spatially-explicit location data, often based on political boundaries (i.e., locations of specific land-use and land-use conversions are not known).', 'Approach 3: The key defining characteristic of Approach 3 is that it is both spatially and temporally consistent and explicit.', 'Sample-based, survey-based and wall-to-wall methods can

in most cases is unknown.', 'It can be introduced by using measuring equipment that is improperly calibrated, by selecting items from a wrong population or by favouring certain elements of a population, etc.', 'For example: Estimating the total fugitive emission from gas transport and distribution using only measurements of leakage from high/medium pressure pipelines can lead to bias if the leakage in the lower pressure distribution network (which is significantly more difficult to measure) is neglected.', 'Biochar\\nFor the purpose of this report, biochar is defined as a solid material generated by heating biomass to a temperature in excess of 350 Â°C under conditions of controlled and limited oxidant concentrations to prevent combustion.', 'These processes can be

(CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs.', 'There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons.', 'Most typically, the CO2-equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon.', 'Carbon sequestration\\nThe process of storing carbon in a carbon pool.', 'Category\\nCategories are subdivisions of the four main sectors

and Power (CHP) generation.', 'Combined heat and power (CHP)\\nCombined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, is the simultaneous production of both electricity and useful heat for application by the producer or to be sold to other users with the aim of better utilisation of the energy used.', 'Public utilities may utilise part of the heat produced in power plants and sell it for public heating purposes.', 'Industries as auto-producers may sell part of the excess electricity produced to other industries or to electric utilities.', 'Comparability\\nComparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by countries in inventories are comparable among countries.', 'For this purpose, countries should use agreed methodologies and formats for estimating and reporting inventories.', 'Completeness\\nCompleteness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines for the full geographic coverage in addition to other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specific to individual countries (and therefore may not be included in the IPCC Guidelines).', 'Confidence\\nThe term âconfidenceâ is used to represent trust in a measurement or estimate.', 'Having confidence in inventory estimates does not make those estimates more accurate or precise; however, it will eventually help to establish a consensus regarding whether the data can be applied to solve a problem.', 'This usage of confidence differs substantially from the statistical usage in the term confidence interval.', 'Confidence interval\\nA confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed/estimated data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter.', 'The interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval.', 'Most commonly, the 95 per cent confidence level is used.', 'Consistency\\nConsistency means that an inventory is internally consistent in all its elements over a period of years.', 'An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base year and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks.', 'An inventory using different methodologies for different years can

relationship between two quantities.', 'See correlation coefficient.', 'Correlation coefficient\\nA number lying between â1 and +1, which measures the mutual relationship between two variables that are observed together.', 'A value of +1 means that the variables have a perfect linear relationship; a value of â1 means that there is a perfect inverse linear relation; and a value of 0 means that there is no straight line relation.', 'It is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations.', 'Country-specific data\\nData for either activities or emission factors that are based on research carried out on sites either in that country or otherwise representative of that country.', '1 âCoefficient of variationâ is the term, which is

limit.', 'Dam\\nAn artificial structure that is barrier used to hold back water in a reservoir.', 'Typically constructed with mineral sediment or concrete.', 'Degassing emissions\\nElevated gas emissions that occur as water is released from a dam and experiences sudden changes in pressure, temperature and turbulence.', \"These changes cause air-water exchange processes to occur at much greater rates than in surface waters as the released water approaches a new equilibrium with the environment downstream following Le Chatelier's principle.\", 'In the case of dams the change in the hydrostatic pressure before and after water passing through turbines affects this balance.', 'Also, water released from dams is typically released into a stilling basin designed to dissipate much of the turbulent energy of the flow in order to prevent excessive bank erosion in the natural river channel downstream.', 'The increased water column turbulence greatly increases the air-water gas transfer rate for a given dissolved gas concentration.', 'In some cases, water may be discharged through needle valves into the air, which provides very high air-water contact area leading to rapid gas release.', 'Decision tree\\nA decision tree is a flow chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the

'Frequently estimated using the Thin Boundary Layer model of gas transfer.', 'Displaced emission\\nAn emission of greenhouse gases that has been relocated in space (and possibly in time) but unchanged in quantity.', 'For example, remineralisation and emission of CO2 of 1 kg of soil C assumed to occur in an agricultural field may actually occur downstream in a river, reservoir or ocean if that 1 kg of soil C is carried into the stream network as a consequence of rainfall.', 'The carbon is still converted to CO2 but enters the atmosphere at a location downstream of the carbon source.', 'Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)\\nSum of all inorganic carbon species in solution (e.g.', 'carbonate, bicarbonate, carbonic acid, carbon dioxide).', 'Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)\\nOrganic carbon remaining

to help policymakers and all of society achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, internationally agreed environmental goals and the multilateral environmental agreements.', 'It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analyzing current and past environmental policy, and identifying future options for achieving sustainable development by 2050.', 'The original request to prepare GEO-6 came from Member states at the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), when, in paragraph 8 of resolution 1/4, the Executive Director of UNEP was requested, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook, supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global, intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNEP/EA.1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer-reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policymakers, to be endorsed by the Environment Assembly no later than in 2018.', 'At its third session, the Environment Assembly, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of its decision 3/1, requested the Executive Directorio issue the sixth Global Environment Outlook at least three months before the fourth session of the Assembly; to schedule the negotiations on the Summary for policymakers at least six weeks in advance of the fourth session of the Assembly; and to present the Outlook and the Summary for consideration and possible endorsement by the Assembly at its fourth session.', 'Scope\\nGEO-6 builds on previous GEO reports and continues to provide an analysis of the state of the global environment, the global, regional and national policy response as well as the outlook for the foreseeable future.', 'It differs from previous GEO reports in its emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals and in providing possible means of accelerating achievement of these goals.', 'GEO- 6 is made up of four distinct but closely linked parts.', 'â Part A assesses the state of the global environment in relation to key internationally agreed goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals.', 'â Part B provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the policy response to these environmental challenges.', 'â Part C reviews the scenarios literature and assesses pathways towards achieving Agenda 2030 as well as achieving a truly sustainable world in 2050.', 'â Part D identifies future data and knowledge necessary to improve our ability to assess environmental impacts.', 'The GEO-6 also considers key policy questions.', 'These include:\\nâ What are the primary drivers of environmental change?', 'â \\nWhat is the current state of the environment and why?', 'â How successful have we been in achieving our internationally agreed environmental goals?', 'â Have there been successful environmental policies?', 'â What are the policy lessons learned and possible solutions?', 'â Is the current policy response enough?', 'â What are the business as usual scenarios and what does a sustainable future look like?', 'â What are the emerging issues and megatrends including their possible impacts?', 'â What are the possible pathways to achieving Agenda 2030 and other internationally agreed environmental goals?', 'The development of GEO-6 involved extensive collaboration both within UN Environment and between UN Environment and a network of multidisciplinary experts and research institutions.', 'The intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation mentioned above (Oct. 2014) requested that experts for content development, including reviewers and advisory groups, be nominated by governments and other main stakeholders based on their expertise and using a transparent nomination process while considering geographic and gender

Development and internationally agreed environmental goals, and to implement the multilateral environmental agreements.', 'It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analysing current and past environmental policies and identifying future options to achieve sustainable development by 2050.', '{1.1}\\nSince the first edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) in 1997, there have been many examples of environmental improvement, especially where problems have been well- identified, manageable, and where regulatory and technological solutions have been readily available.', 'Much more can be achieved in that regard through more effective implementation of existing policies.', '{Chapters 12 to 17}\\nNevertheless, the overall condition of the global environment has continued to deteriorate since the first edition of GEO, despite environmental policy efforts across all countries and regions.', 'Environmental policy efforts are being hindered by a variety of factors, in particular unsustainable production and consumption- patterns in most countries and climate change.', \"GEO-6 concludes that unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society.\", '{Chapters 4 to 9}\\nUrgent action at an unprecedented scale is necessary to arrest and reverse this situation, thereby protecting human and environmental health and maintaining the current and future integrity of global ecosystems.', 'Key actions include reducing land degradation, biodiversity loss, and air, land and water pollution; improving water management and resource management; climate change mitigation and adaptation; resource efficiency; addressing decarbonization, decoupling and detoxification; and the prevention and management of risk and disasters.', 'Those all require more ambitious and effective policies, including sustainable consumption and production, greater resource efficiency and improved resource management, integrated ecosystem management, and integrated waste management and prevention.1 2 3 4 {Chapter 22}\\n\\nMainstreaming environmental considerations into social and economic decisions at all levels is of vital importance.', 'In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, GEO-6 shows that environmental issues are best addressed in conjunction with related economic and social issues, taking into account synergies and trade-offs between different goals and targets, including consideration of eguity and gender dimensions.', 'Governance can be improved at the local, national, regional and global levels, including broad coordination between policy areas.', 'More ambitious and effectively implemented environmental policies are necessary, but alone they are not sufficient to meet sustainable development objectives.', 'At the same time as ensuring sustainable sources of financing for sustainable development and aligning financing flows with environmental priorities, capacities have to be strengthened and scientific information taken into account for environmental management.', 'Strong commitment from all stakeholders, partnerships and international cooperation would greatly facilitate the realization of environmental goals.', '{Chapters 22, 23, 24}\\nGEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is the best foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being.', 'As figure SPM.1 illustrates, human behaviour has had various impacts on biodiversity, atmosphere, oceans, water and land.', 'That environmental degradation, which ranges from serious to irreversible, has had a negative impact on human health.', 'Atmospheric pollution has had the most severe negative impact, followed by degradation of water, biodiversity,

between approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius and 1.2 degrees Celsius (very likely).', 'Eight of the ten warmest years on record have occurred within the past decade (virtually certain).', 'If greenhouse gas emissions persist, global average temperatures will continue to increase at the current rate, crossing the temperature target agreed as part of the Paris Agreement between 2030 and 2052 (very likely).', 'The Paris Agreement committed countries to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that doing so would significantly reduce the risks and impact of climate change.', 'Current nationally determined contributions, presented in Paris in 2015, constitute only one third of the mitigation required to establish a least- cost pathway for staying well below 2 degrees Celsius (well established).', '{2.2, 2.7, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.3.4} To maintain a good chance of remaining well below a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, emissions need to drop by between 40 and 70 per cent globally

emissions and the balancing of emission sources and sinks (established but incomplete).', 'In addition to emissions reductions for C02 the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (also called forcers), specifically black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons, provide opportunities to limit warming in the short term and are a critical component of an integrated climate change mitigation and air-quality management programme.', 'However, since long-lived greenhouse gases dominate climate forcing in the long term, decreasing

on\\n4.1 The need for urgent, sustained and inclusive action\\nWithout additional policies, trends in environmental degradation are projected to continue at a rapid rate and the related Sustainable Development Goal targets and internationally agreed environmental goals are not expected to be achieved, including on climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, excess nutrient run-off, land degradation and ocean acidification (well established).', 'Current patterns of consumption, production and inequality are not sustainable, adding to other severe environmental pressures.', 'Many environmental indicators are projected to move in the wrong direction.', 'Projected population growth, urbanization trends and economic development will significantly increase demand for natural resources, such as food, energy and water, towards 2050.', 'Under a business-as-usual scenario, resource efficiency in production and consumption, agricultural yields and nutrient use, water and energy efficiency are projected to increase, thereby partially offsetting demand for key environmental resources.', 'However, such improvements will be inadequate to reduce the pressure on already-stressed environmental systems.', '{21.3.1â21.3.5}\\nIndicators related to human development are projected to improve, but trends are insufficient to meet related targets (established but incomplete).', 'Improvements are projected on global hunger, and access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and modern energy services, but significant inequality of access remains, and those improvements are not expected to take effect quickly enough for many countries to achieve the related Sustainable Development Goal targets.', 'Preventable environment-related health risk factors are projected to remain prominent in 2030.', 'Related global child mortality is projected to decrease, but not sufficiently for many developing countries to achieve the related Development Goal target, in particular in sub- Saharan Africa.', 'Furthermore, air pollution is expected to continue to contribute to millions of premature deaths in the coming decades.', '{21.3.2, 21.3.3, 21.3.4, 21.3.6}\\nOverall, the world is not on track to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals by 2050.', 'Urgent action is now needed to reverse those trends and restore both environmental and human health to the planet (established but incomplete).', 'Future projections show that development is either too slow to achieve the targets or even that it moves in the wrong direction (see figure SPM.8).', 'Continuing failure to take urgent action is leading to ongoing and further potentially irreversible adverse impact, including on critical environmental resources and human health.', '{Section 2.2} Current patterns of consumption and production may be more expensive in the long term for many countries, as it often costs more to clean up later than it does to prevent damage now, added to which cleaning up later may not always be possible.', 'For example, a further delay in climate action increases the cost of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, and at some point will make it impossible to achieve them.', '{21.3.3, 21.4, 24.4}\\n4.2 Transformative change and an integrated approach are needed\\nPathways exist that show that the healthy planet needed for sustainable development can be achieved (established but incomplete).', 'The literature includes many scenarios that provide information on the ways in which the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals can be achieved.', 'Those pathways emphasize a number of key transitions in moving towards a healthy planet.', 'They are associated with achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns for energy, food and water in order to provide universal access to those resources, while preventing climate change, air pollution, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, and overexploitation and pollution of oceans.', 'They include changes in lifestyle, consumption preferences and consumer behaviour on the one hand, and cleaner production processes, resource efficiency and decoupling, corporate responsibility and compliance on the other hand.', '{22.3}\\nTransformative changes are needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals.', 'They go beyond what can be achieved by environmental policies alone (established but incomplete).', 'The rate of change in the pathways indicates that incremental environmental policies alone will not suffice.', 'A mix of social and technological improvements and innovations is required, facilitated by effective policy measures and cooperation on a scale from the local to the international.', '{22.4.1}\\nMeeting the targets related to climate change, reducing air pollution and providing sustainable energy for all is possible.', 'Measures can be combined in different ways but need to be implemented rapidly and at an unprecedented scale (well established).', 'It involves investment in energy access, enhancing the development and implementation of energy-efficiency improvements, lifestyle changes, a more rapid introduction of low greenhouse gas-emission technologies (including sustainable and eguitably-produced bioenergy, hydropower, solar, wind and carbon-capture-and-storage), air pollution control and reducing emissions and increasing removals from land use and land-use change and forestry of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (including non-C02 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture).', 'Pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement are characterized by a reduction of carbon intensity in the global economy of 4 to 6 per cent per annum between now and 2050 (compared with 1 to 2 per cent per annum historically), which would reduce energy system greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050.', '{22.3.2}\\nEliminating hunger, preventing biodiversity loss and halting land degradation is possible by combining measures related to consumption, production, waste and redistribution of food, and nature conservation policies (established but incomplete).', 'Scenarios achieving those social and environmental targets are typically characterized by a 50 per cent faster improvement in agricultural yields than a business-as-usual scenario, but depend heavily on changes on the consumption side and improvements in food distribution.', 'Plaiting biodiversity loss would also require measures related to landscape management and protected areas.', 'Ecological infrastructure can buffer farmers and rural and urban communities against climate shocks such as droughts and floods, mitigate water pollution and increase water supply, while at the same time protecting biodiversity.', 'Sustainable agriculture also requires a reduction in the nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance to reduce pollution of freshwater systems, groundwater and coastal zones in oceans.', 'Reducing water scarcity requires more efficient water use, increasing water storage and investing in desalination.', 'Ambitious scenarios in the literature typically show higher water- use efficiency rates than in business-as-usual scenarios, but still fail to reach full water security.', '{22.3.1,22.3.3, 22.3.4}\\nSynergies exist between specific measures and a broad range of sustainability targets, including measures related to education, promoting sustainable consumption, specifically a healthy diet and reducing air pollution (well established).', 'Improved education, especially for women and girls, has a particularly strong connection with health outcomes, economic growth, reduced poverty and better environmental management.', 'Meat products require more land than crops (see figure SPM.4).', 'Therefore, promoting sustainable and healthy diets, reducing food waste in both developing and developed countries, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices would contribute towards meeting the nutritional needs of the 9-10 billion people projected to be on the planet in 2050.', 'In doing so, synergies could be realized between improving health and nutrition, while reducing biodiversity loss, advancing habitat restoration and preventing land degradation and water scarcity.', 'Phasing out the use of fossil fuels and moving towards lower-carbon-emission fuels, including sustainable bioenergy, would lead to important cobenefits, achieving both climate and air-quality targets, the latter also having synergies with improving human health, increasing agricultural production and reducing biodiversity loss.', '{22.4.2}\\nThere are also potential trade-offs between achieving different sustainability targets.', 'Land-based climate change mitigation, namely bioenergy crop production, and agricultural intensification are key measures for achieving climate and food targets respectively, but could have significant detrimental effects on other environmental targets if not managed carefully (well established).', 'While nearly all scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement rely on land-based mitigation measures, their use increases demand for land and could thus have a potentially massive influence on land-use patterns and eventually lead to higher food prices, which would in turn affect food security.', 'Increasing agricultural yields would improve overall food availability and reduce pressure on natural land.', 'Applying unsustainable agriculture practices could lead to land degradation, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.', '{22.4.2}\\n\\nUnderstanding the interlinkage between measures and targets is crucial for synergistic implementation and policy coherence\\n(well established).', 'Integrated approaches would enable synergies to be grasped and potential trade-offs to be dealt with so that environmental targets could be achieved simultaneously.', '{22.4.2}\\n4.3 Innovation for systemic transformation to achieve environmental goals\\nCoordinated and ambitious policy coupled with social and technological innovation, could enable the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, related multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (established, but incomplete).', 'Transformative pathways to sustainable development reguire the following:\\n(i) vision to guide systemic innovation towards sustainability;\\n(ii) social and policy innovation; (iii) phasing-out of unsustainable practices; (iv) policy experimentation; and (v) engaging and enabling diverse actors, including local and indigenous people.', 'Integrated approaches can help to deal with the synergies and potential trade-offs between the various policies and measures.', 'A vision for sustainable development and leadership can energize popular support.', 'Examples of integrated policies for achieving sustainability goals include providing economic incentives, including the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, improving price structures and introducing taxes to internalize social and environmental costs.', '{24.3}\\nTransformative projects and innovative solutions exist that could collectively help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the aims of multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (unresolved).', 'Social, policy and technological innovation is needed.', 'At the local level, many transformative projects and innovative solutions already exist that could be scaled appropriately.', 'Reviewing bottom-up initiatives reveals ideas, actions and programmes that seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and involve a wide range of public and private stakeholders, including the following: (i) nature-based solutions, including those that draw on indigenous knowledge, such as ecological infrastructure and ecological restoration; (ii) monitoring and reporting innovations, including Earth observation systems, for better information on environmental conditions, citizen science initiatives that involve citizens in environmental monitoring and which involve decentralization of technologies to educate and engage citizens (for example, web applications that allow citizens to monitor water quality and report problems to relevant government agencies), and natural capital accounting that integrates economic, social and environmental components;\\n(iii) circular and sharing economy innovations that involve the increased efficiency of resource use, specifically through new business models that better engage with waste products of other production processes and innovations related to the peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services; (iv) innovations and policies that help to reduce toxic substances and solid waste, including plastic waste; (v) improving public awareness and building relevant skills through sustainability and environmental education; (vi) an emphasis on gender equality, the empowerment of women and solutions that promote the fair treatment of all, from the local level to the global arena; and (vii) smart, sustainable cities that, for example, use modern digital technologies to engage and connect with citizens in addressing key sustainability challenges for cities, such as transportation, consumption patterns, energy, nutrition, water and waste management.', '{17.7, 23.11.1}\\n\\nFinancial investment and engagement of individuals, businesses and other non-governmental stakeholders are critical to the achievement of this agenda (established, but incomplete).', 'Unsustainable products and industrial processes could be phased out by introducing the following: (i) new regulatory mechanisms setting standards (for example, securing land tenure rights); (ii) financial mechanisms to boost sustainability investment (for example, on rural electrification), improve chemical use efficiency and minimize harmful chemicals, and to account for both market and non-market risks and impact;\\n(iii) environmental education and education for sustainable development to enhance awareness and competencies for sustainability-driven consumer choices, entrepreneurship, greater corporate social responsibility and promoting viable business models; (iv) exploration and promotion of pathways that provide opportunities for all stakeholders to participate in a well-being economy; (v) overcoming the inertia of existing unsustainable technologies and vested interests and (vi) economic instruments that set a price on pollution.', '{23.11,24.3}\\nTransformative change requires adaptive policy, the creation of an enabling environment for niche innovations and the removal of barriers to change (established, but incomplete).', 'Political, institutional and lifestyle changes can enable a sustainable and inclusive transition to environmental sustainability.', 'Local- scale policy experiments provide space for policy tailoring and innovation that is closely monitored, and also allow for the inclusion of systems of local and indigenous knowledge for improved environmental management.', 'Redress for environmental degradation through legal mechanisms such as access to courts and justice also provide an important mechanism for ensuring inclusive access to a clean and healthy environment for all.', '{23.11,24.2}\\nParticipatory approaches can help decision-makers and non-State actors to identify and pursue innovative solutions towards sustainability (established but incomplete).', 'Participatory and grassroots approaches could provide a useful set of initiatives and aspirational visions, pathways and solutions from stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements.', 'That includes inclusive innovation, in which power and decision-making is relatively decentralized and externalities are internalized.', 'Furthermore, such approaches can highlight gaps and blind spots in distributional equity, responsibility and capacity to address global environmental problems and their solutions.', 'Participatory approaches can help to deliver context-relevant solutions.', 'For example, decentralized renewable energy and microgrids fit neatly into many bottom-up sustainable visions that challenge traditionally modelled large- scale, centralized energy transitions.', 'Accounting for regional differences, gender and other demographics are important for assessing and addressing problems, including the need for disaggregated data.', 'Sustainable Development Goal policy design and implementation requires alignment of the collective wellbeing of actors from the local to other levels, taking into account in particular the needs of the vulnerable and most marginalized in society.', 'Information and communications technology can drive change, if risks such as privacy are minimized.', '{23.9.2, 23.14, 24.3.5}\\nStrengthened international cooperation, including support to least developed countries, is needed to tackle this agenda (well established).', 'International cooperation and support, coupled with financial commitment and international funding, are critical If this agenda Is to be achieved.', 'Effective governance solutions to improve multilevel and multi-country cooperation and harmonization across scales include improved management of interdependencies to reduce Interregional inequalities.', 'Bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral environmental treaties are important governance mechanisms for achieving inclusive and sustainable development across knowledge systems.', '{11.4,19.1,23, 14}\\n4.4 The benefits that will result from following more sustainable future pathways\\nInvestments in policies that address environmental issues promote human health and well-being, prosperity and resilient societies (well established).', 'Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable development Is necessary to resolve environmental problems and ensure environmental protection, especially In developing countries.', 'Sustainable future pathways are intended to create a \"healthy planet, healthy people\".', 'A healthy planet will result In people who live longer, healthier lives: nearly one quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations In a vulnerable situation and in developing countries.', 'Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets on hunger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services could reduce deaths in children under 5 related to malnutrition, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections by more than 400,000 per year by 2030.', 'Furthermore, air pollution is the largest environmental health risk and is projected to continue to have significant negative effects on health, with scenario studies estimating between 4.5 million and 7 million premature deaths by mid-century under a business-as-usual scenario.', 'Combined climate and air pollution policies could reduce those numbers significantly.', '{5.4.1, 21.3.3, 21.3.6, 22.3.2, 22.3.5, 23.12, 24.4}\\nImproved health outcomes have significant economic benefits (through a larger and healthier labour force), as well as demographic implications (established but incomplete).', 'The health co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants can outweigh the costs of mitigation.', 'For example, global health savings for reaching a 2 degrees Celsius target are estimated to be approximately US$54 trillion, compared with global policy costs of approximately US$22 trillion.', 'Decreased child and maternal mortality, especially when combined with female education and access to sexual and reproductive health services, Including modern contraception, is likely to lead to lower fertility rates in the longer term, curbing population growth, one of the major drivers of environmental degradation, thus highlighting the fact that healthy people can also support a healthy planet.', '{2.3, 22.3.5, 24.4}\\n\\n5.', 'Knowledge for action\\n\\n\\n\\n5.1 Improved data and greater knowledge enable better and more effective actions and solutions in more places\\nThough actions must be undertaken on the basis of the knowledge already at hand, the world needs openly accessible data, information, analysis, knowledge and science to better inform and guide what needs to be done to achieve sustainability across all environmental dimensions (established but incomplete).', 'Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, internationally agreed environmental goals and science-based targets will require an integrated approach that considers linkage across different environmental and non-environmental components, building upon disaggregated data generation and incorporating traditional knowledge and citizen science.', 'Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets needs to be followed up upon and reviewed, using the global indicators, complemented by indicators at the national and regional levels, and work is needed to develop the baselines for those targets for which national and global baseline data do not yet exist.', 'Integrated data and analysis can prioritize needs, shape effective policies and strengthen monitoring and evaluation outcomes.', '{3.1,25.1}\\nAdvances in collecting official statistics and other evidence that feed into geographic information systems for environmental monitoring and accounting have expanded knowledge, while highlighting data gaps in every environmental domain (well established).', 'Such gaps limit our capacity to formulate and implement policy solutions.', 'More data will assist in linking people with the environment.', 'Time series data is vitally important in that regard, as it forms the basis for monitoring change.', 'Regular standardized data collection can be translated into statistics and indicators that highlight vulnerabilities within and between communities.', 'Disaggregated data that captures information by gender, ethnicity, race, income, age and geographic region identify critical differences and promote effective policy design.', '{3.5, 3.7}\\nIn addition to filling knowledge gaps with new data, enormous gains can be made from consolidating, curating, harmonizing and increasing open access to existing data which are widely dispersed and cannot be easily combined or compared (well established).', 'Common frameworks, initiatives and political will are needed to merge data sources and make better use of what is available.', 'In that context, the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and the System of National Accounts are robust consensus statistical frameworks and methodological approaches that could be broadly adopted (see figure SPM.9).', 'Rationalizing both existing and newly collected data is essential for the development of indicators.', '{3.3}\\nWhether an indicator can be measured by Earth observation is a major factor in data availability (well established).', 'A revolution in the quality and cost-effectiveness of Earth observation data means that indicators that can be measured remotely have far greater spatial coverage than those that cannot.', 'For example, satellites can estimate deforestation and land use change with increasing accuracy, but cannot monitor all aspects of subsurface ocean environments.', 'Data are particularly sparse for biodiversity, which is measured mostly by in situ observation and genetic analysis.', 'Some freshwater components, such as groundwater and water use, are also data-deficient due to measurement challenges.', 'The dichotomy in the volume of remotely sensed data versus in situ data will Inevitably grow as Earth observation technologies improve.', '{3.4}\\nMore inclusive and open access to data will assist in achieving equity, transparency and best use of data for sustainability and development (established but incomplete).', 'The \"open data\" movement has gained significant traction in recent years, working towards data being freely available to all.', 'Education is a key component of access and countries should be forward-thinking in building capacity to analyse and Interpret environmental data.', 'For many measures, there is a strong Imbalance In data access between developed and developing countries.', 'That contributes to global differences In the ability of nations to understand the environment, its Implications for human health and the use of environmental data for socioeconomic gain.', '{25.2.2}\\n5.2 Opportunities from emerging data sources and the Earth-human systems modelling revolution\\nEmerging data sources, such as Earth observation and Earth-human systems models, when combined with socioeconomic data and contextual analysis, can enable better policy decisions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements (established but incomplete).', '\"Big data\", generated through new approaches and technologies, is emerging as a valuable resource which can Inform environmental assessment processes.', 'Evolving artificial intelligence and technological analytics, including algorithms, programming and mechanical methods, can advance evidence-based Information for decision-making, forming part of what some refer to as the \"fourth Industrial revolution\".', 'There is enormous potential for advancing environmental knowledge if big data can be effectively harnessed and Interrogated.', 'Stronger collaboration between the public and private sectors, especially large corporations involved In big data collection, are critical for promoting economically viable and equitable solutions.', 'Protocols for big data use are continually being developed and refined, but the extreme pace at which big data Is evolving creates the potential for misinterpretation and misuse, raising Issues of ethics, privacy and protection, for which urgent policy attention Is required.', '{25.1.2}\\nFuture sensor technology should allow detailed data disaggregation of spatial and demographic information\\n(established but incomplete).', 'A combination of satellites and airborne and ground-based networks can help to monitor developments and Impact at the local, regional and global levels in near-real time.', 'The resulting data and Information, together with rapidly emerging digital infrastructure, can enable rapid response to changing circumstances.', 'Realizing those benefits, however, depends on appropriate governance and national circumstances for data collection, processing, curation and use, along with combining environmental

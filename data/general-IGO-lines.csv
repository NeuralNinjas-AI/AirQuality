926,IPCC-2007-3.txt, The number of studies of observed trends in the physical and biological environment and their relationship to regional climate changes has increased greatly since the Third Assessment in 2001

1795,IPCC-2007-4.txt,2] o Integrating climate policies in broader development policies makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier
1796,IPCC-2007-4.txt, o Regulations and standards generally provide some certainty about emission levels
1797,IPCC-2007-4.txt, They may be preferable to other instruments when information or other barriers prevent producers and consumers from responding to price signals

1803,IPCC-2007-4.txt, Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate the total cost of complying with emission permits
1804,IPCC-2007-4.txt, o Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently used by governments to stimulate the development and diffusion of new technologies
1805,IPCC-2007-4.txt," While economic costs are generally higher than for the instruments listed above, they are often critical to overcome barriers"

Recommendations on Frameworks for the Financing and Implementation of REDD-plus





 



























Preface
This report presents the outcome of four dialogues on frameworks for the financing and implementation of REDD-plus, which were organized by The Forests Dialogue (TFD) between April and August 2009"
1903,REDD-2010-3.txt," This publication is not a research study but reflects the perceptions, opinions and recommendations expressed by the participants of these dialogues"
1904,REDD-2010-3.txt, It should be seen in the context of the time frame in which the dialogues were held—when international negotiations on REDD-plus were gearing up ahead of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen in December 2009
1905,REDD-2010-3.txt, In many cases participants expressed their views in language that reflected ongoing discussions and deliberations on REDD- plus in the international negotiations
1906,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The outcomes of the four dialogues fed directly into the global negotiation process"
1907,REDD-2010-3.txt, Particularly important in this light were the recommendations made to the Informal Working Group for the Interim Finance of REDD and at the UNFCCC talks in Bangkok in September/October 2009
1908,REDD-2010-3.txt," Those recommendations form the basis of this publication, which synthesizes the contributions of the forest leaders who participated in the dialogues"
1909,REDD-2010-3.txt," The results are presented here in the hope that they will contribute to continuing discussions on the development of REDD-plus, in particular at the national level in countries where REDD-readiness planning is now in full swing"
1910,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
In this document, “REDD-plus” refers to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, including through forest conservation, the sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks, as set out in Article l"

Key Recommendations for Investing in REDD-plus
CONSENSUS ON FRAMEWORKS FOR THE FINANCING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REDD-PLUS
The following recommendations are the main outcome of four TFD dialogues on frameworks for the financing and implementation of REDD- plus"
1913,REDD-2010-3.txt," They represent the views of nearly 100 forest leaders from environmental and social groups, businesses, indigenous peoples, scientific and forest-community groups, trade unions, forest owners, governments and international organizations"
1914,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
FOUNDATIONS FOR REDD-PLUS: SOLID PRINCIPLES AND A FULL RANGE OF FOREST-BASED OPTIONS
1"
1915,REDD-2010-3.txt, Base REDD-plus firmly on sustainability principles
1916,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDEFplus finance mechanisms must be sufficiently robust to deal with both in- country and international leakage; use credible reference levels; and achieve verifiable additionality
1917,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDD-plus projects must show:
► ecological integrity—by maintaining or enhancing biodiversity conservation and other forest ecosystem functions, such as the provision of water, food, fuel and fibre
► social integrity—by recognizing, protecting and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities and ensuring that they can develop their livelihoods and share the benefits of REDEFplus
► atmospheric integrity—by leading to real reductions in carbon- dioxide (C02) emissions and to the stabilization of C02 in the atmosphere alongside deep emissions cuts in other sectors in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
► economic integrity—by providing new economic development opportunities based on the total value of forests as a source of multiple goods and ecosystems services, including new and predictable revenues streams that are adequate to support the additional costs of the sustainable management and conservation practices incurred by resource managers, owners and local communities and reinforced by fair and transparent institutional and policy arrangements,
REDD-PLUS FINANCE MECHANISMS MUST BE:
► effective—they must contribute to tangible and independent third-party-verifiable stabilizations of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases
► efficient— they must result in ‘value for money and allow both private-sector and public-sector institutions to participate on fair terms
► equitable—at a minimum, they must avoid exposing to greater risk the poor and most marginalized rural communities whose livelihoods depend on forests; avert the distortion of forest products markets; and allow broad participation on equitable terms at the national and international levels,

1918,REDD-2010-3.txt, Rian for a full range of forest-based climate-change-mitigation options
1919,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDD-plus must create incentives for the full range of forest- based climate-change mitigation activities, based on the principles and practices of the sustainable management of forests"
1920,REDD-2010-3.txt," In addition to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD- plus finance mechanisms must also create incentives for additional action on forest conservation, the sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of carbon stocks, as envisioned in the Bali Action Plan developed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC),
3"
1921,REDD-2010-3.txt, Give priority to biodiversity under threat
1922,REDD-2010-3.txt, Early investment must give priority to the conservation of areas under the greatest threat that have the highest levels of biodiversity

REDD-PLUS PHASES
4"
1924,REDD-2010-3.txt, Phased approach with strong performance-based safeguards
1925,REDD-2010-3.txt," Participants in the TFD dialogues discussed the essential elements of a phased approach, a model for which was introduced in 20C9 in the Meridian Report"
1926,REDD-2010-3.txt,1 A phased approach would enable REDD-plus to address the drivers of deforestation at a country level according to country-specific circumstances
1927,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Phase 1 The initial preparation-and-readiness phase would involve the development of national-level REDD-plus strategies, including the identification and prioritization of key policy and institutional capacity-building measures for both state and non-state actors"
1928,REDD-2010-3.txt," This would pave the way for investments in phase 2 through the development of systems for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) and the identification of required protocols"
1929,REDD-2010-3.txt," Public-sector, private-sector, multilateral and bilateral grants and investment mechanisms such as the World Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD) and the voluntary carbon market could support this phase"
1930,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Phase 2 In an intermediate second phase, enabling policies and measures would be put in place to allow the implementation of REDD- plus and, based on performance, to encourage scaled-up public-sector and private-sector investments in the following areas:
► institutional capacity, forest governance and information
► land-tenure reforms, sustainable forest management, the restoration of degraded forest landscapes, the strengthening of conservation in protected areas, and comm unity-based fire management
► activities outside the forest sector needed to reduce pressure on forests, such as the promotion of certified sustainable agriculture, sustainable biomass energy production, agroforestry, and the enhancement of small-scale agricultural productivity"
1931,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Financial resources that could support this phase include voluntary contributions from governments, market-linked and transaction-linked international levies, and the auctioning of emission allowances"
1932,REDD-2010-3.txt," Multilateral concessional financing sources such as the Forest Investment Program, as well as bilateral funding, private funding and early market payments, are also options but must be performance-based"
1933,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Phase 3 In phase 3, market mechanisms—such as the carbon market— and fund-based mechanisms would deliver performance-based payments based on third-party-verifiable emissions reductions and carbon-stock enhancements"
1934,REDD-2010-3.txt," Market policies would be designed with the objectives of creating equitable distribution mechanisms, stabilizing prices, and developing risk-management and credit-management vehicles"
1935,REDD-2010-3.txt, Triggers guide the transition from one phase to the next
1936,REDD-2010-3.txt, The eligibility of countries to move from one phase to the next should be based on triggers that are informed by a verification body and help to steer and facilitate processes rather than block them
1937,REDD-2010-3.txt, Triggers would work like referenced indicators and would not constitute an obligation or a checklist
1938,REDD-2010-3.txt," Safeguard policies and criteria for entering the compliance market must apply to both forest nations and donor nations, and also to companies aspiring to enter into REDD-plus arrangements"

1943,REDD-2010-3.txt, Financial stability through public and private funding and country commitments
1944,REDD-2010-3.txt," Stable, reliable and long-term financial flows require strong coordination between public-sector and private-sector donors and investors and robust commitments from both developed and developing countries"
1945,REDD-2010-3.txt, Developed countries must be willing to guarantee supportand long-term financing arrangements that depart from business-as-usual models for north-south financial transfers
1946,REDD-2010-3.txt," Developing countries need to commit to policy and institutional changes that focus on the transformation of land-use dynamics, forest governance, and the flow of resources to indigenous peoples and local communities,
8"
1947,REDD-2010-3.txt, A portfolio of finance mechanisms
1948,REDD-2010-3.txt," Given the scale of the challenge and as part of a well-designed phased approach, there is a need to move beyond the ""markets versus funds"" debate to accommodate a portfolio that makes optimal and coordinated use of both markets and funds as well as other sources of finance, A broad coalition of public-sector and private-sector institutions will need to provide the necessary upfront investments for phases 1 and 2 according to the capacity of each individual institution; investments will need to include both bilateral and multilateral loans and grants,

1951,REDD-2010-3.txt, Robust MRV
1952,REDD-2010-3.txt," In all phases of a phased approach, REDE>-plus must have environmental, social and financial safeguards along with robust MRV at the local, national and global levels,
11"
1953,REDD-2010-3.txt, Performance-based delivery and safeguards
1954,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDD-plus finance must be predicated on perform an ce-based delivery, including proxy- based performance in phase 2, with appropriate safeguards in all
phases"
1955,REDD-2010-3.txt, Phase-3 performance must be underpinned by the independent third-party verification of C02 emissions reductions according to local circumstances in each country
1956,REDD-2010-3.txt," During phase 2, proxies could be overall deforestation or measures such as the implementation of policies and the strengthening, in practice, of the rights of local communities"
1957,REDD-2010-3.txt," Social, environmental and financial assessment in addition to carbon monitoring"
1958,REDD-2010-3.txt," In all phases, assessment of the performance of REDD-plus activities should incorporate social, environmental and financial indicators in addition to the measurement of carbon performance"
1959,REDD-2010-3.txt," Socially, environmentally and financially sound processes, based on adaptive management and learning by doing and with full and effective community participation, will produce secure and tradable carbon assets that are appropriate to the performance-based system that will characterize phase 3"
1960,REDD-2010-3.txt," Depending on national circumstances, social and environmental safeguards should be assessed in parallel to MRV to show the extent to which REDD-plus makes progress in these areas"
1961,REDD-2010-3.txt," Social, environmental and financial audits could be additional and parallel to MRV"
1962,REDD-2010-3.txt," Social, environmental and financial audits must:
be equal in status to other aspects of REDD-plus monitoring simultaneously maintain independence and the possibility of ceding social and environmental audits to a third party be part of improved coordination between relevant government departments be subject to only limited government control prevent excessive transaction costs due to complex intra-agency coordination requirements build on best-practice methodologies encourage engagement with the private sector"
1963,REDD-2010-3.txt," Verification of performance on issues of livelihoods, rights, benefit sharing and consultation"
1964,REDD-2010-3.txt," Social auditing must include:
provisions for men, women and youth in local communities and among indigenous peoples to engage in the design of REDD-plus mechanisms and to participate in REDD-plus activities

Introduction
DIALOGUES ON FRAMEWORKS FOR REDD-PLUS FINANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION
REDD-plusas a global mechanism Is under construction and negotiation at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)"
2002,REDD-2010-3.txt," The Copenhagen Accord, a product of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC, gives prominence to REDFYplus, but because it is not legally binding, all eyes are now on COP 16, which will be held in Mexico City in December 2010, The strength of any new accord that may be produced, and the extent to which Annex I countries will commit to legally binding emissions reductions targets, will determine the potential of a future global REDFYplus mechanism"
2003,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The successful design and implementation of REDFYplus will depend on a reliable, robust and predictable finance mechanism that is transparent and equitable and enjoys the support of key stakeholder groups"
2004,REDD-2010-3.txt," In 2007 and 2008 The Forests Dialogue (TFD) successfully completed a first stream of dialogues under the theme ""Forests and Climate"" with the participation of 275 forest stakeholders"
2005,REDD-2010-3.txt," This culminated in the publication of the influential document Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change* In the wake of this dialogue stream there were indications of a need among policymakers for more detailed and specific insights into and recommendations for the possible financial architecture of a future REDD-plus mechanism, TFD responded to this need by organizing a set of dialogues specifically dedicated to the financial aspects of a future operational framework for REDFYplus implementation"
2006,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The four TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation took place in 20C9 in the run-up to COP 15 in Copenhagen in December 20C9, The dialogues were held on:
25-26 April in New York, United States, parallel toa session of the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF)
19-20 July, in Montreux, Switzerland, after board meetings of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) and the United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD)

►	5-6	August	in Gland, Switzerland
2-3 September In London, United Kingdom,
Nearly 100 leaders of environmental and social groups, businesses, indigenous peoples, scientific and forest-community groups, trade unions, forest owners, academics, governments and international organizations participated in the dialogues, A list of participants is presented on page 45-46 of this report"
2007,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The five guiding principies of Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change formed the foundation of the REDD-plus finance and implementation dialogues"
2008,REDD-2010-3.txt," They were:
► Ensure that forest-related climate-change options support sustainable development in both forest-rich and forest-poor countries,
► Tackle the drivers of deforestation that lie outside the forest sector,
► Support transparent, inclusive and accountable forest governance,
► Encourage local processes to clarify and strengthen tenure, property and carbon rights,
► Provide substantial additional funding to build the capacity to put the above principles into practice"
2009,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The objectives of the dialogues on REDD-plus finance and implementation were to:
define the challenges and opportunities of finance-mechanism options currently being debated in the international community elaborate on the possible solutions to identified challenges develop recommendations to be considered by leaders in the negotiations leading to COP 15,

Discussions on the development of an operational framework for the phases of REDD-plus provided a structure within which TFD’s specific recommendations on REDD-plus finance and implementation emerged"
2010,REDD-2010-3.txt, The recommendations were launched on 1 October 20C9 at UNFCCC talks in Bangkok and received strong interest from negotiators
2011,REDD-2010-3.txt," This report presents the proposed operational framework, the recommendations, and other key points made during the dialogues,
ABOUT THE FORESTS DIALOGUE
TFD is an informal organization that organizes and facilitates stakeholder consultations on a variety of forest-related issues"
2012,REDD-2010-3.txt," In the last two years TFD has convened seven international dialogues under the theme of ""Forests and Climate"" that have engaged hundreds of leaders from a broad range of stakeholder groups, TFD is currently holding consultations on REDD-readiness processes through a stream of three field dialogues in Africa and Latin America,
ABOUT THE NORAD PROJECT “SCALING UP VOICES”
The TFD dialogues on REDD-plus finance and implementation were organized as part of the project ""Scaling Up Voices for Influencing a Post- 2012 Climate-change Regime: Shaping Pro-poor REDD Options,"" which is funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and executed by TFD and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), The objective of the project is to contribute to the delivery of tangible forest-based emissions reductions through national REDD-readiness processes and, ultimately, a post-2012 climate-change regime while directly benefiting the forest-dependent poor and safeguarding environmental values"
2013,REDD-2010-3.txt," While the scope of the project is international, it links international and national levels by supporting national REDD-readiness processes"

SCOPE OF REDD-PLUS
There was consensus among participants in the TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation that, in order to generate the largest-possible C02 emissions reductions as well as cobenefits, a future REDEAplus regime should reflect the bread set of forest-based climate-change mitigation options listed in paragraph l"
2054,REDD-2010-3.txt,"iii of the Bali Action Plan, Forest cover and rates of deforestation vary widely between countries"
2055,REDD-2010-3.txt," The conservation of those primary forests that deliver the greatest mitigation benefits per hectare should receive priority, but competing demands and varying country conditions will require difficult choices and tradeoffs"
2056,REDD-2010-3.txt, The inclusion of the broad set of forest-based mitigation options presented in the Bali Action Plan would allow countries with varying rates of deforestation and levels of forest cover to participate in and commit to measures in their forest sectors that result in net carbon gains
2057,REDD-2010-3.txt," Table 2 shows the elements of REDD-plus and their potential roles in the maintenance, restoration or creation of carbon pools at the landscape level"
2058,REDD-2010-3.txt,"

The broad elements of REDD-plus are:
Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation— activities that protect forests from the threat of conversion or degradation in the immediate or medium term"
2059,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
►- Conservation of forests—activities that focus on the protection of natural forests, especially primary forests"
2060,REDD-2010-3.txt, Special attention is needed on forests that are under protection but which could be threatened byconversion in the future (e
2061,REDD-2010-3.txt, due to national or international leakage)
2062,REDD-2010-3.txt," The inclusion of consecration ensures that countries with high forest cover and low rates of deforestation can also benefit from REDD-plus mechanisms, ►- SFIvl/sustainable management of forests—actions that safeguard existing carbon stocks in working forests that are managed commercially or by communities while ensuring the economically, ecologically and socially sustainable provision of associated ecosystem goods and services"
2063,REDD-2010-3.txt," Such measures guard against long-term decline and, where possible, help to expand carbon stocks, SFM should be implemented as part of coordinated national policies that also include conservation and the restoration of degraded forests,
► Enhancement of carbon stocks—activities at a landscape scale that restore forest ecosystems, enabling them to increase and maintain carbon stocks in such a way that social and ecological integrity is improved,
GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND SCOPE OF REDD-PLUS ARCH ITECTURE
TFD’s focus on the broader scope of REDE>-plus is in line with current use of the term in UNFCCC negotiations"
2064,REDD-2010-3.txt, The broader scope will ensure that finance mechanisms for REDE>-plus guarantee the use of forest- related mitigation options to their maximum potential
2065,REDD-2010-3.txt," It will also create incentives for the participation of a maximum range of forest nations, including countries that have high forest cover and low rates of deforestation, which will help to minimize international leakage,
REDE>-plus will require large investments in countries with very specific needs"
2066,REDD-2010-3.txt," To ensure that funds are accessible to local actors, flexible approaches are needed"
2067,REDD-2010-3.txt, Key questions to be addressed centre on the nature and sources of financial flows and the activities that they might support
2068,REDD-2010-3.txt," A reliable, robust and predictable finance mechanism will be characterized by fairness and transparency and will enjoy the support of all key stakeholder groups"
2069,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
To contribute to C02 emissions reductions in the forest sector in a sustainable manner, REDD-plus must be:
effective: REDD-plus should contribute to measurable and third-party-verifiable CQs emissions reductions"
2070,REDD-2010-3.txt," The creation of ""hotair” under reference levels based on development-path trajectories should be avoided"
2071,REDD-2010-3.txt," Similarly, permanence and additionality must be demonstrated"
2072,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
► efficient: REDD-plus action should generate emissions reductions that are ""value for money” and will encourage both private-sector and public-sector institutions to participate on fair terms"
2073,REDD-2010-3.txt, Forest carbon must be investment-friendly
2074,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
► equitable: REDE>-plus should be conducted with the full inclusion of forest-dependent poor, including the most marginalized rural communities whose livelihoods depend on forests"
2075,REDD-2010-3.txt," At the very least, such people should not be exposed to greater risk"
2076,REDD-2010-3.txt," Instead, mechanisms for benefit-sharing and the inclusion of indigenous peoples and local communities should guarantee improved livelihoods with special attention to gender dynamics"
2077,REDD-2010-3.txt, The full integration of these principles in the operation of REDD-plus funds and payments is an important prerequisite for the successful implementation of REDE>-plus
2078,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Participants in the TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDE>-plus finance and implementation stressed that REDE>-plus finance must be sufficiently robust to deal with both in-country and international leakage and to achieve verifiable additionality"
2079,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDE>-plus projects must lead to real, verifiable C02 abatement and must not result in adverse environmental or social impacts"
2080,REDD-2010-3.txt," They must therefore have:
► ecological integrity—by maintaining or enhancing the conservation of biodiversity and other forest ecosystem functions, such as the provision of water, food, fuel and fibre"
2081,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
► social integrity—by recognizing, protecting and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities and ensuring that such peoples and communities can develop their livelihoods and share the benefits of REDE>-plus"
2082,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
>- atmospheric integrity—by leading to real reductions in C02 emissions and to the stabilization of C02 in the atmosphere alongside deep emissions cuts in other sectors in line with the recommendations of the 4th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"
2083,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
STARTING POINT OF THE DIALOGUES
The main conclusions of TFD’s publication Beyond REDD: The Role of Forests in Climate Change provided solid ground for participants to discuss the financial architecture of REDD-plus"
2084,REDD-2010-3.txt," To ensure the stabilization of atmospheric concentrations of C02, REDE>-plus needs to be an integral part of the post-2012 arrangement on climate change"
2085,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDE)- plus can deliver its full C02 mitigation potential if measures are harmonized with policy frameworks that promote not only emissions reductions but also removals through the conservation and sustainable management of forests and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks
2086,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDD-plus also requires developing countries to advance or accelerate coherent sectoral and cross-sectoral strategies that facilitate its implementation
2087,REDD-2010-3.txt," A phased approach would include an interim period in which a series of institutional, legal and educational measures would be implemented, tailored to the specific needs of countries"
2088,REDD-2010-3.txt," The success of these measures would depend on effective participatory consultation and the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders—particularly forest-rights’ holders such as indigenous peoples, other forest-dependent communities, individual family forest owners, and small-holders, as well as other categories of land-owners—in decision-making processes"
2089,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDD-plus must provide development opportunities for all these groups
2090,REDD-2010-3.txt, The TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation achieved consensus on the idea that the concerns of stakeholders should be accommodated in UNFCCC negotiations and in the subsequent implementation of REDD-plus policies
2091,REDD-2010-3.txt, Some groups stressed the need to ensure the fair distribution of REDD payments
2092,REDD-2010-3.txt," For a majority of forest communities, at least some of their rights to the benefits derived from forests are contested"
2093,REDD-2010-3.txt, The interests of such groups must be taken into account not only for ethical reasons but also to avoid conflicts that would jeopardize the contribution of forests to climate- change mitigation
2094,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
At the start of the first TFD dialogue in this stream, the following questions were posed:
► Should REDE>-plus financing be market-based or fund-based?
► Should REDD-plus finance mechanisms be developed primarily to incentivise national or sub-national initiatives?
► Should a fund be available to complete the preparatory phase of REDD-plus?
► To what degree should REDD-plus emissions reductions be fungible (interchangeable) with emissions reductions in other sectors?
To what degree should the allocation of REDD-plus payments be subject to the delivery of co-benefits?
Progress was made on most issues, although the question of the fungibility of REDE>-plus emissions reductions was not resolved"
2095,REDD-2010-3.txt, Concerns in developing countries over procedures for establishing REDE>-plus reference levels and the implications for related finance mechanisms were placed in the context of capacity requirements
2096,REDD-2010-3.txt," Business representation in the TFD dialogues highlighted the need for the proper clarification of the concepts of carbon stock and flow, uncertainty and discount rates"
2097,REDD-2010-3.txt," These, it was made clear, will underpin the decision-making of investors w/ho may provide funding for REDD-plus"
2098,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
The preparation-and-readiness phase of REDE>-plus (see next chapter) was discussed extensively in light of these and other concerns: it should be used to make countries competitive in future REDE>-plus financing and to ensure the full and informed acceptance of REDE>- plus by local communities"
2099,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
DEFINITIONS

Operational Framework for the Phases of REDD-plus
A model for a phased approach to REDD-plus was introduced in 2009 in the Meridian Report5 The operational framework for such a phased approach presented here is the direct outcome of discussion sessions and breakout groups held during the second and third TFD dialogues on frameworks for REDEFplus finance"
2139,REDD-2010-3.txt," The framework, which is presented in Table 3, addresses the outcomes, safeguards, financial mechanisms and triggers of each of the three phases of REDD-plus implementation; it represents common ground for dialogue participants"
2140,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
INTRODUCTION OF THE PHASED APPROACH
A phased approach to REDD-plus, comprising a preparation-and- readiness phase, a policies-and-measures phase, and an implementation phase, would allow the development of country-specific instruments to tackle the drivers of deforestation during an interim period before links to markets are established"
2141,REDD-2010-3.txt," Participants in the TFD dialogues agreed that initial phases, while essential, should not be so long as to delay unnecessarily the introduction of performance-based measures in phase 3"
2142,REDD-2010-3.txt, A phased approach should encourage flexibility and not aim to generate a single blueprint for all countries
2143,REDD-2010-3.txt," Rather, a phased approach should give countries the ability to design strategies tailored to their specific circumstances and portfolios of funding, which could include both market- based and fund-based finance"
2144,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Phase 1: Preparation and readiness
In phase 1, countries would develop strategies that address the drivers of deforestation through a learning-by-doing process that directly meets the needs of local people"
2145,REDD-2010-3.txt," Readiness programs should concentrate on forest governance reform, capacity-building and the strengthening of legal systems and law enforcement"
2146,REDD-2010-3.txt, Political and institutional governance reform can only be successful through the equitable and effective engagement of stakeholders and the recognition and development of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities
2147,REDD-2010-3.txt," The clarification of land, tenure and carbon rights should be expedited"
2148,REDD-2010-3.txt, Robust multi-stakeholder platforms must ensure the effective participation of both state and non-state actors
2149,REDD-2010-3.txt, Particular attention is needed to ensure gender balance and the representation of the most-vulnerable poor
2150,REDD-2010-3.txt," This phase could be supported by public-sector and private-sector funding and by multilateral and bilateral grants and investment mechanisms such as FCPF, UN-REDD and voluntary carbon markets"
2151,REDD-2010-3.txt,"


Phase 2: Policies and measures
Processes during phase 2 would pave the way for upfront investments through the development of systems for MRV and the identification of required protocols"
2152,REDD-2010-3.txt, Countries will develop portfolios of funding using both market-based and fund-based sources
2153,REDD-2010-3.txt," As an intermediate stage, phase 2 should enable the development of the policies and measures needed for performance-based REDD-plus implementation"

2157,REDD-2010-3.txt," Multilateral concessional financing sources such as the FIP, bilateral and private funding, and early market payments are also options for funding, but they must be based on performance"
2158,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Phase 3: Performance-based payments
By phase 3, performance-based payments sourced through market mechanisms such as the carbon market and fund-based mechanisms would pay for third-party-verifiable emissions reductions and carbon- stock enhancements"
2159,REDD-2010-3.txt," Market policies must be designed with the objective of creating equitable distribution mechanisms, stabilizing prices, and developing risk-management and credit-management vehicles"

Triggers
The use of triggers could help to streamline and facilitate a country’s progress from one phase to another and to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks"
2163,REDD-2010-3.txt," Based on social and environmental criteria rather than achievements in emissions reductions alone, triggers would strengthen the focus on and development of safeguards that guarantee the meaningful participation of key stakeholder groups; the establishment of risk management; and the promotion of social and environmental co-benefits, including biodiversity conservation and the provision of other ecosystem services"
2164,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
PHASE l: PREPARATION AND READINESS
Outcomes in phase 1
Participants in the TFD dialogues emphasized the importance of the following specific outcomes during phase 1:

• policy and governance gaps
• environmental and social auditing
• market elements such as legal contracts, revenue flow, and carbon-market supply chains
• national reference levels

Safeguards in phase 1
The development of social and environmental safeguards for REDD-plus is an essential precondition for successful REDD-plus implementation and will only be achieved through the transparent and meaningful participation of stakeholders, including indigenous peoples and local communities, REDD-plus implementation should be accompanied by specific safeguards with the following characteristics:
► The United Nations Economic and Social Council’s Nine Major Groups structure—as found within the UNFF and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD)— serves as the model for inclusive stakeholder participation for REDD-plus,
► National authorities recognize the role of local and traditional authorities, for example at the village level, and support these to participate in capacity-building,
► Self-selection is encouraged, as is the flow of information back to local communities and all participants,
► A system is developed for representation and there are basic guidelines on processes for nominating participants and spokespersons,
► Participants in REDD-plus stakeholder processes should represent the interests of broader groups"
2179,REDD-2010-3.txt, Legitimate (self) selection processes and bread representation are important but should not compromise the efficiency of the process
2180,REDD-2010-3.txt," Models based on majority votes or con sen sus-building are possible, and an enhanced grievance mechanism is essential,
► Safeguards should protect the most vulnerable of the forest- dependent poor"

Finance mechanisms for phase 1
Bilateral and multilateral grants are important sources of finance for phase 1 but there is a danger that current availability is insufficient"
2183,REDD-2010-3.txt," Building the capacity of forest nations to leverage negotiations on REDD- plus can help bridge the gap, but TFD-dialogue participants also suggested the following actions and possible financial sources:
► the establishment of national forest finance plans, with financial strategies and flows from national treasuries
► funding from the private sector, for example as part of corporate social responsibility initiatives
► the development of forest-carbon bonds as finance mechanisms
► the preparation of pilot projects
► public-sector and private-sector funding
► multilateral arrangements from mechanisms such as FCPF and UN-REDD

Double-counting should be avoided by ensuring the transparency of registries and the integration of transaction logs, A public-sector and/or private-sector financial seivices provider should assess the eligibility of forest-carbon assets through the underwriting of risk"
2248,REDD-2010-3.txt,"



Financial Architecture
A phased approach to the implementation of REDD-plus and the development of financial frameworks for REDD-plus has several advantages, including:
the room it creates for an extensive preparation-and-readiness phase, thus enabling the strengthening of governance arrangements and capa city-building allowing the debate on financing to move beyond ""fund versus market,""
COMMITMENTS, GOVERNANCE REFORM AND MIXED FUNDING
Financial arrangements for REDE>-plus activities will have to fulfil different requirements in different countries and the volume of finance will have to increase over time"
2249,REDD-2010-3.txt," Stable, reliable and long-term financial flows require commitments from both developed and developing countries and strong coordination between public-sector and private- sector donors and investors"
2250,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Developed countries must be willing to guarantee support and long-term finance arrangements that depart from business-as-usual models for north-south financial transfers"
2251,REDD-2010-3.txt," Developing countries need to commit to policy and institutional changes that focus on the transformation of land- use dynamics, forest governance, and the flow of resources to indigenous peoples and local communities"
2252,REDD-2010-3.txt," Since a voluntary fund cannot be used by participating developed countries for compliance, there is a need for market-based approaches"
2253,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
It is unlikely that financial support will be available for REDE>-plus in contexts where basic good governance is lacking, even though the need for REDD-plus is often most urgent in such places"
2254,REDD-2010-3.txt," This has been coined the ""governance paradox"" and deserves greater attention in debates on REDE)-plus financing"
2255,REDD-2010-3.txt," Oneway to address the paradox is to make upfront official development assistance (ODA)-style funds available in phase 1 that can be used to improve governance, REDD-plus finance must pay
attention to broader mitigation blueprints and seek greater integration with other sectors, rather than being a stand-alone effort"
2256,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Possibilities for linking a REDD-plus finance framework with payments for other ecosystem services such as biodiversity should be explored"
2257,REDD-2010-3.txt, ITTO’s efforts in this regard through its “REDD and Enhancing Environmental Services in Tropical Forests” (REDDES) thematic program can serve as an example
2258,REDD-2010-3.txt," A broadening of payments would encourage essential intersectoral cooperation; by providing additional income it would also help offset the opportunity costs needed, for example, to prevent the conversion of forests and forest land to high-yield cash-crop farming"
2259,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Any REDD finance mechanism—market-based or fund-based—needs to properly address the concepts of carbon stock and flow, uncertainty, and discount rates"
2260,REDD-2010-3.txt," Clarity on these concepts is important because they will underpin the decision-making of any investor providing funds for REDD- plus, whether a donor, a government institution or a market actor"
2261,REDD-2010-3.txt," Investments in REDD-readiness can help to make countries competitive within a future REDD-finance architecture, and an effective preparation- and-readiness phase can ensure the full and informed acceptance of REDD-plus by local communities"
2262,REDD-2010-3.txt, Experiences with voluntary carbon markets and afforestation and reforestation through the CDM provide valuable lessons for the design of REDD-plus finance mechanisms
2263,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDD- plus finance frameworks must be iterative, transparent and adaptive"
2264,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
FUND-BASED AND MARKET-BASED FUNDING OPTIONS UNDER A PHASED APPROACH
A phased approach would allow countries to develop funding options that are tailored to their specific requirements and would also move the debate beyond “markets versus funds”"
2265,REDD-2010-3.txt," Countries should accommodate portfolios that make optimal and coordinated use of markets, funds and other sources of finance"
2266,REDD-2010-3.txt," A broad coalition of public-sector and private- sector institutions would be needed to provide the necessary upfront investments for phases 1 and 2, along with bilateral and multilateral loans and grants"
2267,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDD-plus funding must be additional to regular ODA
2268,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Interim funding for phases 1 and 2 can be obtained through bilateral funds or arrangements such as the FCPF and UN-REDD, and the FIP can assist with capacity-building as well as make initial investments"
2269,REDD-2010-3.txt," Funding requirements will increase, and the predictability and continuity of funding will also be crucial"
2270,REDD-2010-3.txt," Over time, additional sources of funding could include grants, loans and guaranteed finance from multilateral banks and carbon markets"
2271,REDD-2010-3.txt," Options for long-term finance include a voluntary, ODA-type fund and direct market mechanisms for REDD-plus credits"
2272,REDD-2010-3.txt, A hybrid mechanism might also be created that generates finance through auction processes or by establishing a dual market in which REDD-plus credits are linked but are not fully fungible with existing certified emission reductions
2273,REDD-2010-3.txt," While a combination of mechanisms might be essential for addressing the specific and varying socioeconomic needs of different countries, it is also essential that effective and transparent governance arrangements are in place"
2274,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Carbon markets could be implemented within a short time frame and would have far greater potential in terms of volume than ODA-type funding"
2275,REDD-2010-3.txt, They also encourage risk management at local levels that directly addresses implementation problems on the ground and therefore reduces the need to deal with these issues at the national level
2276,REDD-2010-3.txt," The idea of carbon markets is contentious, however, because of sensitivities about the governance and institutional reforms that would need to take place, such as those that may be construed as impinging on national sovereignty or that address property rights"
2277,REDD-2010-3.txt, Most participants in the TFD dialogues were convinced that it is very unlikely that funding would be made available in contexts lacking basic governance arrangements
2278,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Distribution mechanisms are most relevant in phase 2: they must ensure that benefits reach all stakeholders and they must be sensitive to future generations"
2279,REDD-2010-3.txt, It is important that benefits are not diminished disproportionately by intermediaries on their way to beneficiaries at ground level
2280,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification, Financial Assurance
The success of REDD-plus implémentation will stand or fall on the extent to which it achieves third-party-verifiable C02 emissions reductions"
2281,REDD-2010-3.txt," Equally important, however, are financial efficiency and the fulfilment of fundamental social and environmental safeguards"
2282,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Consensus was reached in the TFD dialogues on the importance of safeguard policies, which should be designed within a phased- approach framework"
2283,REDD-2010-3.txt," In other words, the preparation-and-readiness, policies-and-measures, and implementation phases should all be equipped with safeguard instruments that consider transparency, ownership, legality, governance and FPIC"
2284,REDD-2010-3.txt," In addition, safeguards must guarantee that stakeholder groups, notably commonly marginalized groups such as indigenous peoples, small forest owners and enterprises, and community groups, have the capacity to organize and represent themselves in decision-making processes"
2285,REDD-2010-3.txt, Key stakeholder groups should be identified in the preparation-and-readiness phase and a participation mechanism should be designed to facilitate the flow of information among these groups over the course of the three phases
2286,REDD-2010-3.txt," FPIC should be implemented in each phase, although the focus would change between phases"
2287,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
In addition to the assessment of changes in carbon stocks, the performance of REDD-plus activities should be measured against social, environmental and financial indicators at the local, national and global levels"
2288,REDD-2010-3.txt," Socially, environmentally and financially sound processes, based on adaptive management and learning, and with full and effective community participation, will produce secure and tradable carbon assets that are appropriate to the market-oriented system that would characterize phase 3"
2289,REDD-2010-3.txt," In phase 1, the emphasis would be on reducing risks and setting the parameters for REDD-plus activities that will deliver reductions in later phases, ensuring the effectiveness of the mechanism through strong stakeholder involvement"
2290,REDD-2010-3.txt," It is also important to reduce risks to livelihoods: this will require attention to governance reforms; land, tenure and carbon rights; and the rights and needs of indigenous peoples and other local communities"
2291,REDD-2010-3.txt," In phase 2, the delivery of REDD- plus finance can be measured against performance-based proxies such as overall rates of deforestation, the Implementation of policies, and the strengthening, in practice, of the rights of local communities"
2292,REDD-2010-3.txt, Performance in phase 3 must be underpinned by the independent third- party verification of C02 emissions reductions according to local circumstances in Individual countries
2293,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
There is common ground among forest stakeholders on the need to adhere to the principle of FPIC in Implementing REDD-plus strategies; it should be applied in each phase"
2294,REDD-2010-3.txt, Mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving conflicts should be incorporated as important safeguards
2295,REDD-2010-3.txt," Participants in the TFD dialogues noted that the intent of FPIC is closely linked to stakeholder participation and consultation as well as the delivery of co-benefits, such as sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity conservation, and the equitable sharing and distribution of forest-carbon- related income"
2296,REDD-2010-3.txt," FPIC is a right for indigenous peoples, but it is also a consultative process and a requirement that applies to other stakeholders, such as local communities and forest owners"
2297,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Social, environmental and financial audits must be equal in status to other aspects of REDEFplus monitoring"
2298,REDD-2010-3.txt," Safeguards can best be maintained through third-party monitoring with limited government control and verification, or through the full ceding of social and environmental audits to a third party"
2299,REDD-2010-3.txt, Improved cross-sectoral cooperation and coordination at the national and sub-national levels would help improve the capacity to maintain safeguards
2300,REDD-2010-3.txt, Audits should build on existing methodologies and encourage engagement with the private sector
2301,REDD-2010-3.txt," While safeguards are important, REDEFplus arrangements should not be overloaded with requirements that threaten innovation in the market or land-ownership reform processes"
2302,REDD-2010-3.txt," Equally, given that it is basically an emissions-driven mechanism, REDEFplus should not be expected to perform miracles in advancing social and environmental agendas"
2303,REDD-2010-3.txt,"

Social auditing must include specific arrangements for focusing on gender issues and for the inclusion of youth"
2304,REDD-2010-3.txt, Indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent people must be engaged in the design and implementation ofall the activities of REDD-plus mechanisms
2305,REDD-2010-3.txt, Benefits cannot be prescribed but must flow from processes that engage and consult local groups from the earliest stages of decision-making processes
2306,REDD-2010-3.txt, Adequate distribution mechanisms should be assured and benefit arrangements should be clarified
2307,REDD-2010-3.txt, The monitoring and avoidance of negative impacts on forest-dependent poor is the absolute minimum reference level
2308,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Environmental auditing should report on the delivery of biodiversity conservation and the maintenance of other ecosystem functions, such as the protection of watersheds and soils and the continued provision of timber and non-timber forest products"
2309,REDD-2010-3.txt," The conservation of high-biodiversity areas needs to be prioritized, including in early action on forest landscape restoration"
2310,REDD-2010-3.txt," As for social and financial audits, independent third-party verification is preferred"
2311,REDD-2010-3.txt,"

Institutional Arrangements
The implementation of REDD-plus requires forest-governance reforms through inclusive processes that build on existing forest-governance systems"
2312,REDD-2010-3.txt," REDE>-plus implementation will draw on lessons from existing carbon-accounting mechanisms, such as those deployed in the voluntary carbon markets"
2313,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
GOVERNANCE REFORM AND INCLUSIVE PROCESSES
The strengthening of governance arrangements and institutions needs to incorporate learning through piloting, adaptive management and knowledge transfer"
2314,REDD-2010-3.txt," The focus should be on making progress on issues such as carbon rights, tenure rights and distribution mechanisms"
2315,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
A REDD-plus oversight body with technical, financial and administrative responsibilities, including on forest governance and REDE>-plus protocols, should be set up under the COP to ensure viable REDE>-plus finance in the long run"
2316,REDD-2010-3.txt, Representation by countries could be on the basis of United Nations regions
2317,REDD-2010-3.txt, The REDD-plus oversight body must have the authority to evaluate the eligibility of countries to move from one phase of REDE>-plus to the next
2318,REDD-2010-3.txt," The COP could set the priorities, such as caps on the proportion of C02 emissions that Annex I countries may offset"
2319,REDD-2010-3.txt," A project-by-project approach could be taken in phases 1 and 2, with grants and early action generated by the private sector"
2320,REDD-2010-3.txt, REDE>-plus governance structures at both the national and international levels must include independent cross-cutting mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving conflicts
2321,REDD-2010-3.txt," Corruption cannot be overlooked, but nor can REDD-plus be expected to eliminate it on its own"
2322,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
REDD-plus must be underpinned by transparent, inclusive and accountable forest management based on local processes"
2323,REDD-2010-3.txt," This will require strong partnerships founded on respect for the rights and active participation of indigenous peoples and local communities, consistent with international obligations and standards such as UNDRIP and locally defined measures and legal systems"
2324,REDD-2010-3.txt," A key concern is the clarification and strengthening of tenure, property and carbon rights"
2325,REDD-2010-3.txt," Where possible, the engagement of stakeholders should build on the many national-level experiences of stakeholder involvement in FLEG processes"
2326,REDD-2010-3.txt," Multi- stakeholder platforms in the REDD-plus planning process would not only contribute to equitable participation and representation, they would also be more effective and generate more efficient interventions"
2327,REDD-2010-3.txt, Multi- stakeholder platforms promote better understanding of the role of each stakeholder group and help improve communication between groups and can therefore help to avoid or diminish potential conflicts
2328,REDD-2010-3.txt,"

In order to minimize transaction costs, existing forest-based instruments such as voluntary partnership agreements, UN-REDD, FIP, FCPF and FLEG should be used as much as possible in the hope of avoiding the need fora new global mechanism"
2329,REDD-2010-3.txt, Efforts should be made to strengthen coordination and collaboration between such instruments
2330,REDD-2010-3.txt, National REDD-plus coordination bodies must work across the public and private sectors and have a multi-stakeholder membership
2331,REDD-2010-3.txt," An important issue is the potential for channelling cross-sectoral cooperation through REDD- plus finance, which therefore should be part of the broader climate- change mitigation blueprint rather than a stand-alone effort"
2332,REDD-2010-3.txt," Integrating payments for broader ecosystem services into the REDD-plus finance framework, such as is being done by ITTO through its REDDES thematic program, can help to increase cooperation between sectors and make implementing REDD cheaper"
2333,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
LESSONS FROM STANDARD TAX CODE AND ACCOUNTING
Participants in the TFD dialogues pointed to existing mechanisms that can provide lessons for designing REDD-plus finance mechanisms: these include the voluntary carbon market, afforestation and reforestation projects under the CDIvl, and other functional financial systems for payments for ecosystem services"
2334,REDD-2010-3.txt," Financing REDD-plus will be a learning process on its own; thus, the management system employed within the REDD-plus finance framework will need to be iterative, transparent and adaptive"
2335,REDD-2010-3.txt," The TFD dialogues generated suggestions for financing tools as potential safeguard instruments, including accounting principles accredited by current financial accounting standards bodies, a forest-carbon-credit insurance mechanism, and an auditing system for REDD credits,
REDD-plus mechanisms need to build on experiences gained in the existing voluntary carbon market, particularly with regards to carbon- market accounting and credible standards and certification"
2336,REDD-2010-3.txt," At the national level, REDD-plus provisions should make use of existing government regulations and structures and capitalize on existing monitoring and independent third-party-verification mechanisms, such as forest certification systems"
2337,REDD-2010-3.txt," Tax-code and financial accounting standards for carbon transactions and investments in the public and private sectors should be established, and should be compliant with existing practices and institutions"
2338,REDD-2010-3.txt," Where existing practices and institutions are inadequate, new mechanisms will need to be created"
2339,REDD-2010-3.txt," At the international level, the International Transaction Log should be used to help verify transactions"
2340,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
Future Role of TFD
Forest nations in the tropics are showing an interest in participating in future REDD-plus mechanisms, but the monetary and technical resources available for the planning and implementation of readiness processes are still limited"
2341,REDD-2010-3.txt," Although approaches to REDD-plus will need to be country-specific and will differ, for example, in their sources of funding, policymakers and decision-makers in different countries will face very similar problems in the development of national REDEFplus strategies"
2342,REDD-2010-3.txt," There is a risk that the vital inputs of stakeholders on key issues around REDD-plus, and opportunities to share experiences and lessons learned from pilot projects and national processes, will be lost"
2343,REDD-2010-3.txt,"
TFD can playa key role by creating a feedback loop between the international and local levels that will assist in adapting approaches to country-specific situations and changing circumstances, guided by longterm rules, TFD’s field dialogues aim to bridge the gaps between enthusiasm and know-how and to make sure that the voices of diverging stakeholders are better heard"
2344,REDD-2010-3.txt," In October 2009 TFD started its REDD- readiness field dialogues, a third stream of dialogues under the ""Forests and Climate"" theme, with the aims of:
►  catalyzing stakeholder engagement processes, raising awareness, and promoting the exploration of REDEF readiness challenges
►  learning from national and local experiences on the preparation-and-readiness phase of REDD-plus
► establishing a feedback loop between international and local REDEF plus-related processes
CONCLUDING COMMENT
Participants in TFD’s initiative on frameworks for REDD-plus finance and implementation recognized that REDD-plus will only achieve lasting results if it can be adapted to the individual circumstances of countries and if countries have the political will to adapt policies and methods to meet the needs of REDEFplus implementation"
2345,REDD-2010-3.txt, The nature of the finance mechanisms that underpin REDE>-plus is critical for determining whether and how these pre-conditions for success are met

Foreword
Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to development today"
2357,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Addressing climate change requires that countries transform their economies and grow in a different way — climate and development planning must be integrated so that policies and actions across multiple sectors and scales lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and deliver poverty reduction gains"
2358,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The good news is that countries have new and expanded opportunities to finance climate change actions — billions from the public and private sectors will be channeled toward climate activities"
2359,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In order for countries to take advantage of these opportunities, however, the right institutional and financial mechanisms must be in place so that resources are directed efficiently toward national climate and development priorities"
2360,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
An important tool for countries to manage climate finance is a National Climate Fund NCFs are nation- ally-driven and nationally-owned funds that help countries to collect climate finance from a variety of sources, coordinate them, blend them together and aoiount for them"
2361,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In this way, countries are in the driving seat and can make informed choices fo r how direct resources toward activities that deliver results on the ground
This guidebook is part of a series of practical guida nee documents and toolkits to support national and sub-national governments to achieve low-emission, climate-resilient development It provides information based on UNDP's decades of experience in delivering climate change programming in order to help countries design and establish an NCF that is tailored to their priorities and builds on existing governance, policy and fiscal framework and systerrs"

Overview
Overview
By pledging $30 billion in climate change finance by 2012 and up to $100 billion annually by 2020, governments have ushered in a new era of funding for climate change"
2364,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Only ten years ago, climate finance was managed by a small number of large funds associated with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process"
2365,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Today, there has been an explosion of public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources that offer countries new opportunities to address their climate and development needs"
2366,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
While this new landscape of climate change funds provides increased resources, it also brings increased complexity"
2367,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Requirements, processes and reporting can differ among the funds and countries are faced with the challenge of identifying which funds are appropriate for them, how to collect resources, how to blend them together, how to coordinate the actions funded by them and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results"
2368,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Given the diversity of funds, it is critical that countries can build on existing institutions and programmes to manage resources at the national level to support country- driven objectives"
2369,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
One tool that can help countries respond to these challenges is a National Climate Fund (NCF)"
2370,UNDP-2011-5.txt," An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to manage their engagement with climate finance by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance"
2371,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs provide a country- driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval, measure project implementation and performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds and assist with partnership management"
2372,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs help countries to blend various resources together at the national level, providing a mechanism for shifting power away from traditional top-down fund management to country-level management"
2373,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A country's climate change objectives are managed and supported from the inside out, not the other way around"
2374,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Designing an NCF requires carefully considering its objectives and then crafting a structure that supports the achievement of these objectives"
2375,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Many NCFs deliver a common set of services, however the exact components and structures to deliver the services vary greatly according to national circumstances and priorities"
2376,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In other words, the way in which the fund's components are designed shapes how the NCF delivers its support"
2377,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, an NCF capitalized by international and national public finance will collect and blend resources differently that an NCF that relies only on private finance"
2378,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Tailored fiscal tools and mechanisms will be required to access and channel public and private sources effectively
2379,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Further, depending on its capitalization modalities, an NCF may aim to strengthen capacities of national stake holders, including for direct access to climate finance"
2380,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

Overview
A key lesson learned from UNDP's experience in administering over 750 funds around the world, and in providing trustee and administrative agent services for over $5 billion in multi-donor trust funds, is that a National Climate Fund must be carefully designed to align with national objectives and capacities on climate change"
2381,UNDP-2011-5.txt," To accomplish this, the design and administration of an NCF can demand extensive time, effort and resources"
2382,UNDP-2011-5.txt," While this guidebook does not focus on if a country should establish an NCF, it does help countries deepen their understanding of the design choices that are critical to successful NCFs"
2383,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In the pages that follow, countries can identify the scope and scale of an NCF that matches their needs and priorities and decide if an NCF is right for them"
2384,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
It is UNDP's hope that this guidebook will help countries to make the most out of the expanding climate change finance landscape"
2385,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Well-designed NCFs can better equip countries to blend domestic and international, public and private, and concessional loan and grant climate finance at the national level"
2386,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In this way, NCFs can help countries achieve results and more efficiently and effectively support the transition toward low-emission and climate-resilient development"
2387,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Purpose of Guidebook
The purpose of this guidebook is to assist countries in designing a National Climate Fund"
2388,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It leverages UNDP's experience with funds at the global, regional, national and sub-national levels and shares lessons learned about designing and administering NCFs"
2389,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It also aims to provide a simple, robust and transparent method for meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the design process"
2390,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Target Audience
The principle audience for this publication is the decision-maker at the national and sub-national levels, as well as domestic and international experts involved in assisting governments in establishing institutions and frameworks to support the management and delivery of climate finance"
2391,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Structure of Guidebook
The guidebook is divided into three parts"
2392,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Chapter 1 provides an overview of NCFs, including the basic goals and functions"
2393,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Chapter 2 provides a process for designing an NCF, including identifying the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) structures and systems"
2394,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each of these components is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitates decision-making for that component
2395,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Chapter 2 also describes UNDP's approach for consolidating stakeholder input by creating a term sheet

2400,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"1 | Climate Finance Landscape
Climate change is regarded as a key environment and development challenge for the 21st century"
2401,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Affecting every continent, climate change impacts threaten to undo progress made toward poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals"
2402,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Governments agree that business- as-usual development will not suffice — countries need a new way forward that helps their economies grow in a manner that acknowledges the pressing reality of climate change
2403,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Countries must transition toward a new paradigm that supports low-emission, climate-resilient development, shifts production and consumption processes to emit fewer greenhouse gases and promotes sustainable development"
2404,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Ushering in a new development paradigm requires a dramatic increase in climate change finance"
2405,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Recognizing this, governments gathered at the UNFCCC Climate Change Conference in Cancun and pledged $30 billion in ""fast start"" funding — climate funds pledged between 2010 and 2012 — and up to $100 billion annually by 2020"
2406,UNDP-2011-5.txt," These pledges have been matched by an explosion of public and private funds outside of the UNFCCC process, offering countries new resources to undertake climate change mitigation and adaptation actions"
2407,UNDP-2011-5.txt," UNDP estimates that, taken together, there are already more than 50 international public funds, 45 carbon markets and 6,000 private equity funds providing climate change finance"
2408,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"1 Each of these public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources offers new opportunities for countries to address their climate and development needs"
2409,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The increase in climate change funding opportunities makes it important for countries to consider how to attract and leverage different types of climate change investment, including that from private sources"
2410,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about 40% of the global additional investment needed in climate change finance in 2020 will come from private households, 40% from businesses and the remaining 20% from government"
2411,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"2 With private sector funds outnumbering government funds by an enormous margin, a key challenge for countries will be to use scarce public funds to attract private investment"
2412,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Public funds — such as those under the UNFCCC — must be leveraged in strategic ways to attract new resources from the private sector
2413,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The dramatic increase in opportunities to access climate finance is matched by equally increasing complexity"
2414,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The requirements, processes and reporting associated with the many funds can be confusing and overwhelming"
2415,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Countries are faced with the challenge of how to identify which funds are appropriate for them, how to coordinate the actions funded by them,and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results"
2416,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"2 Further, countries must also figure out ways to blend funds together so that multiple sources can support climate change initiatives"
2417,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This will be necessary to finance a complete transformation toward low-emission and climate-resilient development

Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
1"
2419,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"2 Key Goals of a National Climate Fund
One tool that countries can use to meet this challenge is a National Climate Fund (NCF)"
2420,UNDP-2011-5.txt, NCFs are a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes
2421,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The key goals of an NCF are the collection, blending, and coordination, as well as strengthening national ownership, of climate finance (Figure 2)"
2422,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each of these goals can be tailored to support country-driven climate change priorities based on national circumstances and realities
2423,UNDP-2011-5.txt, NCFs can also serve as a gateway for enhanced capacity building and knowledge sharing among stakeholders
2424,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The NCF's four goals provide the foundation for its programmatic and operational components"
2425,UNDP-2011-5.txt," First, by collecting and distributing funds to climate change activities that promote national priorities, an NCF
provides a unified engagement point where the government, donors, development partners, civil society and other stakeholders can engage on and make decisions about climate change issues"
2426,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Moreover, while traditional mechanisms under the UNFCCC are limited to collecting donor funds or resources under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an NCF can attract a more diverse variety of sources of climate financing"
2427,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Public, private, multilateral and bilateral funds, as well as innovative sources, can be collected by an NCF for coordinated and streamlined results"
2428,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Second, an NCF facilitates the blending of public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of climate finance"
2429,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It is rare that one or two funds would be able to cover the costs necessary to transition and entire economy toward low-emission, climate-resilient development"
2430,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Rather, countries must blend together multiple sources — public, private, multilateral, bilateral — in a coordinated and streamlined way that is strategic and can further catalyze more resources to support action on climate change"
2431,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
NCFs can be designed to complement and blend sources from the emerging global public climate change financial system"
2432,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and the emerging Green Climate Fund will each collect resources and direct them toward climate projects at the regional, national and subnational level"
2433,UNDP-2011-5.txt," National Climate Funds are not meant to duplicate these financial flows, collect funds from them or increase the burden on countries and implementing entities"
2434,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Rather, NCFs provide a mechanism that can blend these resources with others resources at the project level"
2435,UNDP-2011-5.txt, NCFs can provide the means for leveraging public funds to attract private funds and provide national-level coordination among and alongside the global climate finance system
2436,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Third, NCFs can coordinate country-wide climate change activities"
2437,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The NCF mechanism responds to the need to provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding to support the achievement of national priorities on climate change and development"
2438,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In their structure and operations, NCFs are consistent with several principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, including national ownership and alignment with national priorities; harmonization and coordination; effective and inclusive partnerships; and achieving development results and accounting for them"
2439,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"3 I Common Functions of a National Climate Fund
Once a country decides to establish an NCF, stakeholders must identify the specific and necessary functions of the NCF"
2440,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Functions should build upon existing mechanisms and systems that support action on climate change
2441,UNDP-2011-5.txt," They can include goal setting, strategic programming, capitalization, partnership management, project approval, policy assurance, financial control and performance measurement"
2442,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each should be considered carefully
2443,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The functions of an NCF influence its components and services
2444,UNDP-2011-5.txt," An NCF with ill-designed functions runs the risk of not only failing to reach its goals, but of undermining progress toward low-emission, climate-resilient development"
2445,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
In UNDP's experience, there are a number of core functions that are common to any funding mechanism, including NCFs"
2446,UNDP-2011-5.txt," First, an NCF should enhance or provide a system that supports goal setting and the development of programmatic strategies on climate change"
2447,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By setting in place a process that aligns and supports existing general goals and strategic programmes, the NCF can provide a coordinated supporting structure to a country's national climate and development priorities"
2448,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Further, by facilitating regular discussions and stakeholder engagement on national climate issues, an NCF can serve as a central body for discussion and decision-making about how the NCF will support national action"
2449,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
An NCF should provide for fundraising toward climate priorities"
2450,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Indeed, the capitalization of the NCF — its ability to collect and raise funds — is one of the core functions that make an NCF a useful tool for implementing low-emission, climate-resilient development"
2451,UNDP-2011-5.txt," As demonstrated in Chapter 2, capitalization can take a variety of forms and can utilize public, private, multilateral, bilateral and innovative sources of finance"
2452,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
An NCF can provide a mechanism for managing partnerships by clearly defining and coordinating the roles of various climate change stakeholders"
2453,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The NCF can complement and support the management of relationships with other financing mechanisms, such as those under the UNFCCC or with other multilateral, bilateral, public and private sources"
2454,UNDP-2011-5.txt, It can also ensure the clear management of the responsibilities of stakeholders at all levels and across climate change initiatives
2455,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
NCFs can provide a coordinated project approval and implementation structure for climate change programming"
2456,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Uniform project cycle guidelines that clearly outline the technical and eligibility requirements support streamlined operations
2457,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Well-conceived guidelines can facilitate the transparent approval process of NCF climate change initiatives
2458,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Moreover, an NCF can supply systems to ensure that quality standards are met throughout its operations"
2459,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs offer policy assurance through social and environmental safeguards, financial controls that ensure fiscal monitoring and reporting and performance measurement that outlines specific performance criteria and then evaluates projects and programmes to ensure that the NCF delivers effectively and efficiently"
2460,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The NCF can become an important source of knowledge and information management that consolidates and disseminates lessons from climate change projects and programmes"
2461,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The exchange of such information can build capacity, help projects implement good practices and spur innovative solutions to implement country-driven priorities on climate change"
2462,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

Chapter 2: Designing a National Climate Fund

2"
2463,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"1 | Common Components and Structural 1 Overview of a National Climate Fund
Given the diversity of design options, there are a number of key decisions that must be made in order to ensure that an appropriate and effective NCF structure is established that maximizes the delivery of climate finance to support national priorities"
2464,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Important decisions on each component of the fund must be considered in order for an NCF to achieve the core goals and functions described in Chapter 1
2465,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds and more than 40 multi-donor trust funds, six common components have been identified that provide the basic skeleton for any NCF: objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV)"
2466,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Chapter 2 of this guidebook focuses on a step-by-step decision-making process for the design of each component"
2467,UNDP-2011-5.txt, A description of each component is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitate decision-making for that element
2468,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The end of Chapter 2 brings all of these decisions together into a term sheet that facilitates stakeholder engagement and consolidates stakeholder inputs on each component
2469,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
NCFs are not ""one-size-fits-all,"" but many funds arrange the components into a common structure to support the delivery of NCF services"
2470,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The structure includes funding sources, governing bodies, a trustee and implementers"
2471,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Funding sources provide funds to the NCF while the governing bodies make decisions about the operations of the fund
2472,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The trustee manages the transfers of funds to and from the NCF's bank account
2473,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Implementers receive funds and ensure activities are undertaken
2474,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each of these agents supports the delivery of actions to achieve the strategic priorities of the NCF
2475,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
UNDP has developed a structural overview (Figure 3) that demonstrates how these components can be arranged and the various design questions that must be answered"
2476,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Resources, coordination, support and MRV flow between sources, governing bodies, the trustee, implementers and recipients"
2477,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Throughout each component, stakeholders should consider how the NCF will deliver its services and what structural components and design decisions are necessary to support the achievement of the NCF's priorities"
2478,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

A set of governing bodies is usually at the centre of an NCF"
2479,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Often, a steering committee or other group makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities of the fund, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting"
2480,UNDP-2011-5.txt," This group is often made up of multiple ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners"
2481,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The chair person of the steering committee can be a government representative or other participant
2482,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The steering committee is usually supported by two other governing bodies, a technical group that provides substantive reviews of project proposals and a secretariat that manages day-to-day operations of the NCF"
2483,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
In a majority of funds, resources flow from the sources to the trustee, which holds them on behalf of the NCF"
2484,UNDP-2011-5.txt," When the governing bodies make decisions about how the funds should be allocated, the steering committee will direct the trustee to distribute the funds to the implementing entities"
2485,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The implementers conduct the projects and the recipients receive the benefits
2486,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The implementers then report on their activities to the governing bodies
2487,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In the case of loans, the loans will be repaid back to the trustee"
2488,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The NCF structure can be tailored to align with its designated functions and national priorities"
2489,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Depending on the objectives of an NCF, specialized systems can be put in place to manage financial flows"
2490,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, if a fund capitalizes national banks to provide low-cost loans for projects such as renewable energy, it may assign the government as the source of funds and the national banks the trustee"
2491,UNDP-2011-5.txt, MRV would be conducted by the banks according to their lending criteria
2492,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In the case of an NCF using innovative financing mechanisms, such as taxes on bunker fuels, to support activities, the infrastructure must be set up in order to accommodate the collection and distribution of these funds"
2493,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This kind of flexibility helps each entity associated with the NCF to fulfill the role that best supports the objectives of the fund
2494,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The relationship between the NCF's various bodies must be carefully defined through the design process so that each decision is implemented efficiently and promotes national climate and development objectives"
2495,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The flows of funds, support and coordination of an NCF should align with its objectives so that the fund can operate smoothly"
2496,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Relationships with the private sector and civil society should also be considered and clarified"
2497,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In some NCFs, the private sector and/or civil society play important roles in the fund's structure, including serving as a donor, an implementer or a representative on a governing body"
2498,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In cases where the private sector or a civil society group has met the necessary fiduciary standards, they can also serve as the trustee"
2499,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

















































































Importantly, NCFs must be firmly rooted in national realities"
2500,UNDP-2011-5.txt, National priorities and circumstances provide an important context for NCF delivery and can lead to opportunities and challenges as an NCF becomes operational
2501,UNDP-2011-5.txt," To provide stability, NCFs should take this into account by aligning with national climate change strategies, institutions, frameworks and stakeholders; however, NCFs must also have the flexibility to adjust overtime"
2502,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Maintaining both stability and flexibility is imperative to stakeholder engagement"
2503,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Throughout the design phase of an NCF, stakeholder consultations are critical to ensure that the NCF is robust and effective"
2504,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Including various government, multilateral, bilateral, private and civil society actors in the development and establishment of the NCF helps to more clearly identify needs and requirements and to accommodate best practices"
2505,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"


















Programmatic and Management Objectives

As a first step in setting up an NCF, a country must identify its strategic goals on climate change and how the NCF will help it to achieve these goals"
2506,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The NCF may serve the country by driving resources to national climate activities, such as mitigation, adaptation, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), capacity building, technology building or other priorities"
2507,UNDP-2011-5.txt," An NCF’s objectives may also include attracting private sector investment, or formalizing a system to collect resources from “polluter pays” policies that collect revenue from industry"
2508,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
An NCF’s objectives provide the foundation for its operations and outcomes"
2509,UNDP-2011-5.txt," When setting objectives, a country should take into account its national climate and development strategies, as well as other analyses and plans, such as the National Communications, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), to identify the priorities of a National Climate Fund"
2510,UNDP-2011-5.txt," These analyses can bring together current thinking on climate change, as well as focus the NCF on priority issues and sectors where activities can be undertaken in a cost-effective way"
2511,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
It is critical that objectives take into account the technical and political considerations that may support or hamper the NCF’s progress over time"
2512,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Thematic priorities, such as increasing renewable energy, must be supported by analyses of the feasibility of increasing investment in that sector"
2513,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Likewise, to achieve other priorities of the NCF, such as capacity building for direct access to climate funds under the UNFCCC, these aims must be acknowledged, and appropriate and supportive systems be put in place"
2514,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Carefully defined objectives must be supported by appropriate functions of the NCF"
2515,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If an NCF focuses on providing a type of “clearing house” for climate change initiatives, it may not be necessary to develop a complicated financial mechanism"
2516,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Likewise, if an NCF is to provide low-cost loans to a specific sector, it would not be necessary for the functions of the fund to include extensive coordination systems"
2517,UNDP-2011-5.txt, A country can select the objectives that match its priorities but must ensure that the objectives are fully supported by the NCF's functions
2518,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

ALIGNING OBJECTIVES WITH OTHER PRIORITIES AND FUNDING WINDOWS

These programmatic considerations should be linked closely with fund management considerations and, importantly, how the NCF will relate to other international and domestic climate funds"
2519,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Some countries may have multiple NCFs that target specific issues — for example, one to provide funding for REDD activities and another for adaptation"
2520,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Others NCFs may be linked to more comprehensive, national strategies"
2521,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In Ethiopia, the Carbon-Neutral, Climate-Resilient Economy mission statement sets out how Ethiopia is responding to climate change and how it can transition toward low-carbon growth"
2522,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The government is considering setting up a national fund to support these activities
2523,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The NCF could be a funding arm and all activities under the NCF would link to Ethiopia's mission statement
2524,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In this model, the national strategy becomes the roadmap for the NCF"
2525,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The scope of the NCF must fully support its programmatic mission"
2526,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If a country has already acquired funds from a specific source, or funds have been earmarked for a specific activity, then it will be important to ensure that the structure of the NCF can channel this funding appropriately"
2527,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Similarly, if a country's goals are to optimize its relationships with stakeholders (e"
2528,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", the private sector) or funding programmes (e"
2529,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", the Clean Development Mechanism) it may be necessary to codify this in the objectives"
2530,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

FUND TIMELINE
Designing an NCF's objectives must also consider timelines"
2531,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If a national strategy or other funding mechanism is time-bound, this may affect the timeframe of the NCF"
2532,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This will be especially important as countries consider their options under the UNFCCC process
2533,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, if an NCF is designed to attract fast start funding, it is important to align the NCF with the 2012 deadline"
2534,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Likewise, the longer-term pledges of up to $100 billion per year by 2020 include a variety of sources, including private finance, and an NCF may wish to accommodate these circumstances accordingly"
2535,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Other NCFs may wish to align themselves with the specific timeframe of a national strategy
2536,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEFINING THE OBJECTIVES:
1"
2537,UNDP-2011-5.txt," What are the national priorities on climate change? Are there short, medium or long-term strategies that the NCF should support (including national strategies, NAMAs, etc"
2538,UNDP-2011-5.txt,")?
2"
2539,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Will the fund focus on thematic priorities (e
2540,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", renewable energy) or support broader objectives?
3"
2541,UNDP-2011-5.txt," How will the objectives of the fund relate to the objectives of other international and domestic funds?
4"
2542,UNDP-2011-5.txt," What timeframe is most appropriate? Should the NCF be time-bound?
5"
2543,UNDP-2011-5.txt," What are the expected financial flows to the fund? Have funds already been pledged? Have these funds been earmarked toward a specific activity that should be acknowledged?
6"
2544,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Are there stakeholders that must be acknowledged in the objectives? (e
2545,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", those associated with a specific industry)
7"
2546,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Should the objectives acknowledge a relationship with an entity or programme?
(e"
2547,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", Clean Development Mechanism)

Building on the fund’s objectives, a country should consider the types of resources that would best capitalize the fund"
2548,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Indeed, deciding where the funds will come from is one of the most important choices that will shape the NCF"
2549,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Many sources of finance — including international, national, public and private — can be delivered through an NCF, but they must build on existing frameworks and be supported by appropriate structures to access and channel funding efficiently"
2550,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
LINKING OBJECTIVES AND CAPITALIZATION
Fund capitalization must be realistic, grounded in the objectives and functions of the NCF"
2551,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Funds with ambitious objectives must have clear expectations of how the fund will be capitalized and the objectives supported
2552,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Designers of NCFs should exercise caution in this regard: expectations of co-financing and leveraging must be based on national circumstances
2553,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Likewise, funds with smaller, targeted objectives should not aim to access billions when it is not appropriate for the scope of the NCF"
2554,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Generally, if a fund has a broad set of objectives, it usually blends together a broader array of sources than more targeted NCFs"
2555,UNDP-2011-5.txt," An NCF with wide objectives — for example, supporting all of the activities under a low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy — may aim to collect funds from international and national sources so that a wide variety of activities can be covered"
2556,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A fund with a more targeted mission will often only focus on a single source, such as those from one bilateral partner"
2557,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"





































INNOVATIVE FINANCING MECHANISMS
A country may also want to consider the use of innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for an NCF"
2558,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In this case, an NCF is designed to collect resources from non-traditional sources of finance such as levies on oil or coal production, fees from polluting companies or proceeds from carbon markets"
2559,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Revenues from these sources are collected by an NCF and then directed toward the programmes and projects that fulfill the goals of the NCF
2560,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, the Brazil National Fund on Climate Change collects funds from revenue from the oil production industry and channels them toward climate change mitigation and adaptation activities"
2561,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Innovative mechanisms require that complementary structures be put in place within the NCF to ensure the efficient collection and delivery of funds"
2562,UNDP-2011-5.txt, NCFs should have the ability to manage and account for funds coming from these non-traditional sources
2563,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

CONSIDERING CONTEXT
With both traditional and innovative sources, it is critical to consider national circumstances in order to optimize capitalization"
2564,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Laws or policies may be required to access and collect certain types of funding
2565,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A tax on an industry, for example, may need to be mandated by a national law that clarifies the rates of taxation"
2566,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Understanding and acknowledging national circumstances is especially important when considering the involvement of the private sector"
2567,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By aligning with existing private sector regulations and incentive structures, for example, the NCF can stimulate and attract private investment by driving public finance toward commercially attractive projects"
2568,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This helps the NCF to contribute toward sound investment and policy decisions that direct private finance toward activities that address national climate and development priorities
2569,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
A country should also consider any available resources that could already feed directly into the NCF or any existing partnerships with donors"
2570,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A country may wish for the NCF to absorb these resources or partnerships, or to align with them so that activities will be undertaken in a coordinated manner"
2571,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If the NCF does absorb them, it is important to note whether they are ""earmarked"" toward specific activities — such as capacity building — that will affect the operations of the fund"
2572,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"





The capitalization of the fund has implications for the size, governance and implementation of the fund"
2573,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, if the private sector provides resources to the fund, then it may be necessary to include private sector representatives in the governance system"
2574,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Furthermore, a number of legal contracts or systems will need to be established in order to collect resources from specific sources"
2575,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For innovative funds, enacting laws, policies or partnership agreements may also be necessary for the efficient capitaliza- tion of an NCF"
2576,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Countries should also consider how additional resources will be raised throughout the life of the fund"
2577,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Some NCFs use a regular fundraising cycle while others adopt the cycles associated with specific sources
2578,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING CAPITALIZATION:
1"
2579,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Based on the objectives of the fund, what kinds of sources will be blended together to capitalize the NCF?
2"
2580,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Will the fund utilize innovative sources, such as levies?
3"
2581,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Will donor funds be allocated to specific activities? (e
2582,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", capacity building, institutional
strengthening, investment)
4"
2583,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Are there any existing sources that could readily feed into an NCF?
5"
2584,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Will the size and sources of capitalization impact the size, governance or implementing arrangements of the fund?
6"
2585,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Are there specific structures necessary to support the fund’s capitalization? (e
2586,UNDP-2011-5.txt,", laws or policies, partnership agreements)
7"
2587,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Will there be a regular process or cycle for raising funds? How will additional sources be attracted?






































Building on the objectives and capitalization of the NCF, countries must identify the appropriate governance system that will optimize the fund's performance"
2588,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Establishing governing bodies, decision-making processes and oversight can facilitate efficient management of the fund in order to drive resources toward implementation"
2589,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
First, a country must consider the scope of the NCF's governance"
2590,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If the NCF has a horizontal structure, the governance system should be inclusive of stakeholders and provide coordination among partners"
2591,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If the NCF is a vertical institution, the governance arrangements may require more stringent reporting and management structures"
2592,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"







GOVERNING BODIES






As discussed previously, many NCFs have a set of governing bodies that make decisions on fund management and strategic direction"
2593,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The bodies within the governance system must have clear roles that effectively support the NCF without adding increased burden or bottlenecks in the programming cycle
2594,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The scope of the bodies should align with the scope of the objectives
2595,UNDP-2011-5.txt," An NCF that supports a comprehensive low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy will require a governance system that is equally compre- hensive"
2596,UNDP-2011-5.txt," On the other hand, if an NCF supports a more targeted objective with limited stakeholders, then the scope of the gover- nance system could also be limited"
2597,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Though not required, many NCFs have a high-level steering committee, chaired by the government, which provides guid- ance and oversight to the fund"
2598,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The steering committee is usually supported by a technical group that provides a substantive review of proposals to the NCF, and by a secretariat that conducts day-to- day operations"
2599,UNDP-2011-5.txt, A technical group is made up of substantive experts who evaluate project proposals and provide recommendations to the steering committee
2600,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The secretariat schedules meetings, corre- sponds with stakeholders, prepares documentation for meetings Both play an important role in supporting the steering committee
Some governments may have existing bodies, frameworks or systems in place that can serve as portions of the governance structure"
2601,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A previously established inter-ministerial climate change committee, for example, can take on the role of the steering committee"
2602,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Or, an existing body within a government ministry may also provide technical expertise or secretariat services"
2603,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Moreover, when multiple environ- ment or climate change funds exist in a country, the governance structure of one fund can support the operations of others"
2604,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Guidelines pertaining to representation on an NCF’s governing bodies should be established during the design phase"
2605,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Many governments choose to have representatives from the sources and implementers, as well as the trustee, on the steering committee"
2606,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This can help to ensure that all parts of the fund are coordinated and streamlined
2607,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Representation guidelines should also carefully outline the role of non- government stakeholders
2608,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Depending on the objectives of the fund, non-government representatives can have decision-making abilities alongside the government, or they may participate as observers"
2609,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

























SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF FUNDING PROPOSALS
The process for submitting and approving proposals should be closely linked to the roles of the governing bodies"
2610,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Identifying who can submit proposals and who approves them will establish the lifecycle of a project proposal
2611,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, the China CDM Fund is governed by an inter-ministerial board made up of the Ministry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and China Meteorological Administration"
2612,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The collection, management and use of the funds are the responsibility of a Management Centre affiliated with the Ministry of Finance"
2613,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Projects are submitted to the Management Centre which then sends them to the NDRC for review and recommendations
2614,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The recommendations are then sent to the entire board for approval
2615,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
As demonstrated by this example, the relationships between governing bodies should be clarified to ensure that decision-making is efficient"
2616,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In many cases, proposals are received by the secretariat, reviewed by a technical group and the technical group's recommendations are forwarded to the steering committee for approval"
2617,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each body has a defined role to support the decision-making process
2618,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Ultimate oversight and of the fund must also be clarified
2619,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, in many NCFs, the Steering Committee is responsible for the delivery of the fund"
2620,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In other NCFs, a government body or other agent may have this role"
2621,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR INSTILLING EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE:
1"
2622,UNDP-2011-5.txt," What governing bodies are necessary to ensure efficient operations of the fund?
Who reports to whom?
2"
2623,UNDP-2011-5.txt," How will any existing inter-ministerial or other high-level national body relate to the fund?

2631,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In the case where there is more than one national environment/climate fund in a country, how do the governing bodies of these funds relate to one another?





























Sound fiduciary management provides the foundation for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from the NCF"
2632,UNDP-2011-5.txt," As the number of sources in the climate finance landscape continues to expand, an NCF must have a system of fiduciary management that accommodates the multiple standards, project cycles and scale of risks of climate change projects"
2633,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
DEFINING FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Fiduciary arrangements facilitate relationships between different actors in the NCF structure"
2634,UNDP-2011-5.txt, An NCF could be potentially coordinating the disbursement of funds to multiple implementers that have different fiduciary standards from the NCF and from each other
2635,UNDP-2011-5.txt, It is critical that decision-makers consider how fidu- ciary standards will apply to these various actors
2636,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Some NCFs choose to have tailored fiduciary standards for different types of implementers or projects
2637,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, an NCF may wish to have a different set of fiduciary standards for a multilateral implementer than for an implementer from the private sector"
2638,UNDP-2011-5.txt, They may also wish to have certain fiduciary standards for a large project that differ from those for a smaller project with lower risk
2639,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"










Some funds have a ""one size fits all"" approach where an NCF sets out fiduciary principles that every implementer must apply to their operations"
2640,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The standards can be as stringent or flexible as necessary
2641,UNDP-2011-5.txt," However, NCF designers should take into account that the various types of stakeholders — government entities, private sector, multilateral entities and others — may have varying degrees of flexibility to adopt these standards"
2642,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

MANAGER OF FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Usually a trustee or administrative agent manages an NCF's transactions and ensures that funds are collected and distributed in a coordinated and effective manner"
2643,UNDP-2011-5.txt," To do this, the trustee provides a number of fund management services, including receiving contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body), investing funds that are not yet disbursed and providing financial reporting"
2644,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The trustee does not make decisions on what projects should be funded by the NCF
2645,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Rather, it holds the funds in an account and receives instructions from the steering committee for the timing and direction of distribution"
2646,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds"
2647,UNDP-2011-5.txt, It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds
2648,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
A national or international body can serve as the trustee"
2649,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For some NCFs, the trustee is a national development entity"
2650,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For instance, the trustee for the Amazon Fund of Brazil is the Brazil National Development Bank (BNDES)"
2651,UNDP-2011-5.txt, BNDES coordinates donations and distributes funds
2652,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Other funds, such as Guyana's REDD+ Investment Fund, use the World Bank as their trustee"
2653,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Still others, such as the Ecuador Yasuni ITT Trust Fund, use the United Nations (UN) system"
2654,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Importantly, if the body selected as the trustee plays additional roles within the NCF, such as for supporting implementation, the NCF should be designed to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest"
2655,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Even if the trustee is an external development partner, NCF designers must clarify the relationship between the trustee and government or domestic financial institutions"
2656,UNDP-2011-5.txt, A national body may wish to engage with the fiduciary management of the NCF in order to support delivery of funds
2657,UNDP-2011-5.txt," This can include oversight functions, capacity building or MRV of funds"
2658,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The trustee may provide a number of other administrative services beyond collecting and distributing funds and legal documentation"
2659,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This may include gathering and disseminating of data on projects to which funds are distributed
2660,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Further, some trustees play a critical role in reporting by consolidating progress reports submitted by implementing entities"
2661,UNDP-2011-5.txt, These updates are distributed along with financial reports to the steering committee or other body
2662,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Almost all trustees require a fee for their services"
2663,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Fees can range from 1 to 5% of funds managed
2664,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Countries should take this into consideration as the agreement with the trustee is established
2665,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Capacity development can be another critical function of fiduciary management"
2666,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Many countries begin with an international body as the trustee but plan to transition this role to a domestic entity in the future
2667,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For this to occur, it is critical that the trustee work closely with national institutions to strengthen domestic fund management so that countries meet international fiduciary standards"
2668,UNDP-2011-5.txt," This close part- nership will support a smooth transition from one trustee to another, and will maintain a coordinated, predictable funding stream"
2669,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENSURING SOUND FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT:
1"
2670,UNDP-2011-5.txt," How will the trustee be identified? Can a government entity serve as the trustee? Is an external development partner required?
2"

( Implementation Arrangements



Implementation arrangements — the processes and agents set in place to implement climate change programming — must support the objectives of the NCF and align closely with the other key design decisions"
2679,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION
Identifying what kinds of programmatic instruments — such as grants or loans — will be used to implement the projects establishes the scope of implementation"
2680,UNDP-2011-5.txt," While many NCFs collect funds and then distribute them as grants, others have diversified their activities to include low-cost loans"
2681,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund distributed a pool of government funds to private banks which then provided low-cost loans for energy efficiency"
2682,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Once the loans were repaid, the money became available for new loans"
2683,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This continual repayment of the initial loan cycle has supported additional loans
2684,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"



There are many options for identifying the programmatic instru- ments, such as grants and loans, for delivery of NCF funds"
2685,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Governments should take stock of their legal and financial tools in order to identify what types of services the NCF can provide
2686,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The role of national banks should be considered, as the ability for the NCF to capitalize lending institutions will have implications for the financial management of the fund"
2687,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In order to provide loans, the bank would need to meet international fiduciary standards, and risk and profit sharing arrangements with the NCF would need to be established"
2688,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
IMPLEMENTERS
Selecting implementers for an NCF should occur in a systematic and transparent way"
2689,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For many NCFs, project implementers are approved or accredited by the steering committee and can then apply for funding for specific projects"
2690,UNDP-2011-5.txt," If project applications are approved, the steering committee directs the trustee to release the funds to the implementing entity"
2691,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Using the NCF objectives as a guide, a number of organizations or bodies can serve as implementing entities"
2692,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs can specify that implementation should be carried out by a government ministry or other agent, similar to the manner in which the Adaptation Fund allows accredited entities to directly access funds for implementation"
2693,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Other options include United Nations agencies, development banks, civil society or the private sector to deliver activities"
2694,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

Depending on the objectives of the fund, implementation can also occur by using combinations of these actors through, for example, public-private partnerships"
2695,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Arrangements like this support the objectives of the fund by establishing flexible systems to ensure that implementation is coordinated and efficient
2696,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
As with the trustee, implementers require a fee for their services"
2697,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Fees can range from 5 to 13% of the projects’ costs
2698,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
ALIGNING IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
With all implementers, it is critical that the programmatic cycle is as streamlined as possible to avoid potential “double” project cycles where the NCF would have one project cycle and the implementers another"
2699,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Projects must be able to move through the system as efficiently as possible in order to avoid unnecessary delays or bottlenecks
2700,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"




































Further, given that many NCFs will operate alongside international climate funds such as the Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund, or other funds at the national or subnational level, it is important that an NCF's implementing arrangements align with the implementing arrangements of other funds"
2701,UNDP-2011-5.txt," This will reduce transaction costs and should contribute to knowledge sharing, since some implementers under the NCF may also be implementers under other funds"
2702,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
It is worth noting that, in some funds, the recipient of the fund and the implementer are separate entities"
2703,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Some NCFs distribute funds to government bodies that sub-contract the implementation work
2704,UNDP-2011-5.txt, These systems should be aligned to ensure effective and efficient delivery

Key Decision 6: Facilitating Effective Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a critical component of an NCF"
2716,UNDP-2011-5.txt," MRV enables the NCF to ensure that results are being delivered, and to collect lessons learned from implementation that will further refine and improve NCF operations"
2717,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The NCF should have unambiguous appraisal and performance criteria"
2718,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each stakeholder responsible for providing information on the activities of the NCF must have clear guidelines and standards
2719,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Public infor- mation systems can often support the dissemination of information
2720,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
PROGRAMMATIC AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Two types of reporting are necessary"
2721,UNDP-2011-5.txt," First, the activities implemented must be reviewed and data submitted on the results of those activities"
2722,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Generally, this is conducted in a bottom-up manner by the implementers, which report activities to one of the governing bodies"
2723,UNDP-2011-5.txt," However, in some NCFs the governing bodies may collect data in a top-down manner by visiting project sites, carrying out evalua- tions or commissioning audits"
2724,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
In the case of project reporting, MRV should be systematized across the NCF"
2725,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Guidelines and templates should be established so each implementer reports on a similar set of metrics
2726,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This data should be collected by one governing body that can compile the information for further analysis and identification of best practices
2727,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Also, institutional arrangements, including the roles of who will be conducting the MRV and who will be compiling the information, should be clarified"
2728,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Second, the status of the finances of the NCF must be reported by the trustee"
2729,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The trustee often provides this information to the secretariat or steering committee on a regular basis
2730,UNDP-2011-5.txt, An NCF may choose to monitor the status of its finances through a series of regular reports or using web-based financial tracking tools
2731,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This real-time tracking supports transparency and access to information
2732,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
ALIGNING MRV SYSTEMS
Similar to the implementing arrangements, MRV systems should align with other domestic and global climate change funds, as well as any MRV requirements of NAMAs, NAPs and other relevant mecha- nisms"
2733,UNDP-2011-5.txt," This helps the NCF MRV system to be cost-effective, robust and to minimize the reporting burden on NCF implementers"
2734,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
NCF MRV systems should also be aligned within the fund to ensure that there are clear roles for oversight and audit functions"
2735,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The body with legal responsibility over implementation and achieving results should be identified and should ensure that the MRV systems optimize the use of existing national systems
2736,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"























Moreover, some NCFs may wish to use MRV as a way to incentivize results"
2737,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By aligning MRV with project effectiveness, NCFs can use the information collected as a basis for future funding for the project"
2738,UNDP-2011-5.txt," For example, in the case of performance-based funds, projects receive initial funding but future support is based on the results achieved"
2739,UNDP-2011-5.txt, This model can promote accountability and provide incentives for recipients to use funds efficiently
2740,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Many MRV systems are new to governments and project implementers that have not been a part of previous MRV systems"
2741,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Importantly, any MRV mechanisms established should provide tools,
                                  methodologies, training and knowledge sharing to help countries strengthen their technical and institutional capacity for developing effective MRV systems"

Consolidating Inputs into Term Sheets
To support efficient, transparent and robust NCF design, UNDP recommends consolidating the design decisions of an NCF into a term sheet organized to capture of the different components featured in this guidebook"
2751,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A term sheet is a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the design and operations of the fund, including the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary manage- ment, implementation arrangements and MRV"
2752,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Capturing the objectives and the functional attributes in this way can help to clearly define the scope and administration of the fund so that it effectively supports country objectives
2753,UNDP-2011-5.txt, An annotated example term sheet is in Figure 5
2754,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, the decision points in a term sheet can be tailored to accommodate NCF components that support national needs and priorities"
2755,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By consolidating design decisions on the components of the fund, the term sheet helps to outline the project cycle and reporting arrangements"
2756,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It also provides a means to codify agreements regarding fees charged by the trustee and implementing entities, if applicable"
2757,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Importantly, term sheets can be used to facilitate engagement with stakeholders during the design process"
2758,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By outlining each element of the NCF, the document can serve as a structure for discussion and help internal and external stakeholders contribute specific and targeted inputs"
2759,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
The information captured in the term sheet can also provide a basis for agreement among fund participants"
2760,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The term sheet can help formalize relationships between NCF sources, governing bodies, implementers and recipients"
2761,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It can also outline the flow of funds, as well as the decision-making systems that shape the relationships between the fund’s participants (e"

Conclusion
Countries have immense opportunities to utilize climate finance — more sources of funding exist than ever before to help countries achieve their climate change objectives"
2852,UNDP-2011-5.txt," However, in order for this increased funding to achieve real results, countries must be equipped to effectively access and channel funds toward their climate and development priorities"
2853,UNDP-2011-5.txt," It is critical that the increased number of funding sources are matched with an increase in a country's ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance"
2854,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
As this guidebook demonstrates, National Climate Funds are a useful tool that can support countries to optimize their access to and management of climate finance"
2855,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs are nationally-owned and nationally- managed so that a country can collect the sources that are right for them, blend them together, impie ment activities in a manner that accomplishes their priorities and set up a nationally-relevant system to account for the results of their work"
2856,UNDP-2011-5.txt," NCFs put countries in the driving seat for transforming their economies and achieving low-emission, climate-resilient development"
2857,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds at the national, global and regional levels, and 40 Multi-Donor Trust Funds around the world, there is a set of key decisions that a country must consider when designing and establishing an NCF:
• Defining the objectives
• Identifying capitalization
• Instilling effective governance
• Ensuring sound fiduciary management
• Supporting efficient implementation arrangements
• Facilitating effective monitoring, reporting and verification
Once key decisions have been made, a country will have crafted the components of its NCF; these components will provide a structure that helps to drive resources toward a country's climate and development priorities"
2858,UNDP-2011-5.txt," A carefully considered and well-designed NCF will ensure that systems are in place to facilitate the flow of funds and monitoring, reporting and verification"
2859,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Further, support and coordination should underscore all of an NCF's components, ensuring that efficient decision-making supports the implementation of projects and programmes that achieve the NCF's goals"
2860,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Importantly, NCFs are not one-size-fits-all"
2861,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Each NCF must be tailored to country priorities and realities
2862,UNDP-2011-5.txt," They should be firmly rooted in, and aligned with, existing national strategies, frameworks, systems and other initiatives on climate change"
2863,UNDP-2011-5.txt, NCFs must also define the fund's relationship to other global funds and programmes so that the NCF can make the best use of available resources and avoid duplicating other efforts
2864,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"

In UNDP's experience, the use of a term sheet helps to define the design and operations of the NCF by capturing the key considerations of each of its components"
2865,UNDP-2011-5.txt," As a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the operations and scope of the fund, a term sheet supports an efficient, transparent and robust NCF design"
2866,UNDP-2011-5.txt," While the questions posed by a term sheet are universal, the answers will be unique to each country"
2867,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Stakeholder engagement is a critical part of the design and establishment of NCFs"
2868,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Government, civil society, academia, the United Nations, development banks, the private sector and others can contribute specific and targeted inputs so that the NCF operates as efficiently as possible"
2869,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Term sheets are also useful for this purpose — they can provide a structure for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all voices are heard, and that roles, responsibilities and expectations are defined clearly"
2870,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Capacity development is also a key element of any NCF"
2871,UNDP-2011-5.txt," The NCF should support on-going capacity development of governing bodies, implementers, the trustee and other stakeholders so that they can drive results and continue to build robust systems that address the country's climate change priorities over time"
2872,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Capacity development is especially important as more global funds include opportunities for countries to access funds directly
2873,UNDP-2011-5.txt, Countries can use NCFs to strengthen national institutions and align with international fiduciary standards so that they can meet the criteria associated with those funds
2874,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
Throughout this guidebook, a number of existing NCFs have been featured"
2875,UNDP-2011-5.txt, It is important to learn from their experiences and build on lessons from their NCF design and establishment process
2876,UNDP-2011-5.txt, A key lesson applicable to all countries designing an NCF is to be very clear about what the NCF should accomplish
2877,UNDP-2011-5.txt," Countries must realistically assess their needs: in some cases the NCF should be very broad and attract many different types of funding sources; in others, a more targeted NCF is necessary to focus on a key priority for the country"
2878,UNDP-2011-5.txt, The targeted NCF can be capitalized by a limited number of funding sources in order to decrease administrative and operating costs
2879,UNDP-2011-5.txt,"
NCFs help countries to manage climate finance and to achieve their sustainable development goals"
2880,UNDP-2011-5.txt," By creating an NCF, a country sets in place a system that efficiently collects, blends, coordinates and accounts for climate finance, helping it to take advantage of the increased number of climate funding sources available"
2881,UNDP-2011-5.txt," In this way, NCFs help countries to manage climate finance catalytically and build a system that supports low-emission and climate-resilient development now and in the future"

Foreword
Climate change is one of the most pressing threats to development today"
2978,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Addressing climate change requires that countries transform their economies and grow in a different way — climate and development planning must be integrated so that policies and actions across multiple sectors and scales lower greenhouse gas emissions, reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and deliver poverty reduction gains"
2979,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The good news is that countries have new and expanded opportunities to finance climate change actions — billions from the public and private sectors will be channeled toward climate activities"
2980,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In order for countries to take advantage of these opportunities, however, the right institutional and financial mechanisms must be in place so that resources are directed efficiently toward national climate and development priorities"

Overview
Overview
By pledging $30 billion in climate change finance by 2012 and up to $100 billion annually by 2020, governments have ushered in a new era of funding for climate change"
2985,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Only ten years ago, climate finance was managed by a small number of large funds associated with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process"
2986,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Today, there has been an explosion of public, private, bilateral and multilateral sources that offer countries new opportunities to address their climate and development needs"
2987,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
While this new landscape of climate change funds provides increased resources, it also brings increased complexity"
2988,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Requirements, processes and reporting can differ among the funds and countries are faced with the challenge of identifying which funds are appropriate for them, how to collect resources, how to blend them together, how to coordinate the actions funded by them and how to develop the methods to monitor and evaluate the results"
2989,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Given the diversity of funds, it is critical that countries can build on existing institutions and programmes to manage resources at the national level to support country- driven objectives"
2990,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
One tool that can help countries respond to these challenges is a National Climate Fund (NCF)"
2991,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," An NCF is a mechanism that supports countries to manage their engagement with climate finance by facilitating the collection, blending, coordination of, and accounting for climate finance"
2992,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs provide a country- driven system that can support climate change goal setting and strategic programming, oversee climate change project approval, measure project implementation and performance, offer policy assurance and financial control of climate change funds and assist with partnership management"
2993,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs help countries to blend various resources together at the national level, providing a mechanism for shifting power away from traditional top-down fund management to country-level management"
2994,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A country's climate change objectives are managed and supported from the inside out, not the other way around"
2995,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Designing an NCF requires carefully considering its objectives and then crafting a structure that supports the achievement of these objectives"
2996,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Many NCFs deliver a common set of services, however the exact components and structures to deliver the services vary greatly according to national circumstances and priorities"
2997,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In other words, the way in which the fund's components are designed shapes how the NCF delivers its support"
2998,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, an NCF capitalized by international and national public finance will collect and blend resources differently that an NCF that relies only on private finance"
2999,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Tailored fiscal tools and mechanisms will be required to access and channel public and private sources effectively
3000,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Further, depending on its capitalization modalities, an NCF may aim to strengthen capacities of national stake holders, including for direct access to climate finance"

Overview
A key lesson learned from UNDP's experience in administering over 750 funds around the world, and in providing trustee and administrative agent services for over $5 billion in multi-donor trust funds, is that a National Climate Fund must be carefully designed to align with national objectives and capacities on climate change"
3002,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," To accomplish this, the design and administration of an NCF can demand extensive time, effort and resources"
3003,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," While this guidebook does not focus on if a country should establish an NCF, it does help countries deepen their understanding of the design choices that are critical to successful NCFs"
3004,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In the pages that follow, countries can identify the scope and scale of an NCF that matches their needs and priorities and decide if an NCF is right for them"
3005,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
It is UNDP's hope that this guidebook will help countries to make the most out of the expanding climate change finance landscape"
3006,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Well-designed NCFs can better equip countries to blend domestic and international, public and private, and concessional loan and grant climate finance at the national level"
3007,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In this way, NCFs can help countries achieve results and more efficiently and effectively support the transition toward low-emission and climate-resilient development"
3008,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Purpose of Guidebook
The purpose of this guidebook is to assist countries in designing a National Climate Fund"
3009,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It leverages UNDP's experience with funds at the global, regional, national and sub-national levels and shares lessons learned about designing and administering NCFs"
3010,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It also aims to provide a simple, robust and transparent method for meaningful stakeholder engagement throughout the design process"
3011,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Target Audience
The principle audience for this publication is the decision-maker at the national and sub-national levels, as well as domestic and international experts involved in assisting governments in establishing institutions and frameworks to support the management and delivery of climate finance"
3012,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

Chapter 1: Overview of National Climate Funds
1"
3040,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"2 Key Goals of a National Climate Fund
One tool that countries can use to meet this challenge is a National Climate Fund (NCF)"
3041,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, NCFs are a mechanism that supports countries to direct finance toward climate change projects and programmes
3042,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The key goals of an NCF are the collection, blending, and coordination, as well as strengthening national ownership, of climate finance (Figure 2)"
3043,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each of these goals can be tailored to support country-driven climate change priorities based on national circumstances and realities
3044,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, NCFs can also serve as a gateway for enhanced capacity building and knowledge sharing among stakeholders
3045,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The NCF's four goals provide the foundation for its programmatic and operational components"
3046,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," First, by collecting and distributing funds to climate change activities that promote national priorities, an NCF
provides a unified engagement point where the government, donors, development partners, civil society and other stakeholders can engage on and make decisions about climate change issues"
3047,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Moreover, while traditional mechanisms under the UNFCCC are limited to collecting donor funds or resources under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), an NCF can attract a more diverse variety of sources of climate financing"
3048,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Public, private, multilateral and bilateral funds, as well as innovative sources, can be collected by an NCF for coordinated and streamlined results"
3049,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Second, an NCF facilitates the blending of public, private, multilateral and bilateral sources of climate finance"
3050,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It is rare that one or two funds would be able to cover the costs necessary to transition and entire economy toward low-emission, climate-resilient development"
3051,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Rather, countries must blend together multiple sources — public, private, multilateral, bilateral — in a coordinated and streamlined way that is strategic and can further catalyze more resources to support action on climate change"
3052,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
NCFs can be designed to complement and blend sources from the emerging global public climate change financial system"
3053,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and the emerging Green Climate Fund will each collect resources and direct them toward climate projects at the regional, national and subnational level"
3054,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," National Climate Funds are not meant to duplicate these financial flows, collect funds from them or increase the burden on countries and implementing entities"
3055,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Rather, NCFs provide a mechanism that can blend these resources with others resources at the project level"
3056,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, NCFs can provide the means for leveraging public funds to attract private funds and provide national-level coordination among and alongside the global climate finance system
3057,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Third, NCFs can coordinate country-wide climate change activities"
3058,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The NCF mechanism responds to the need to provide flexible, coordinated and predictable funding to support the achievement of national priorities on climate change and development"
3059,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In their structure and operations, NCFs are consistent with several principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, including national ownership and alignment with national priorities; harmonization and coordination; effective and inclusive partnerships; and achieving development results and accounting for them"
3060,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"3 I Common Functions of a National Climate Fund
Once a country decides to establish an NCF, stakeholders must identify the specific and necessary functions of the NCF"
3061,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Functions should build upon existing mechanisms and systems that support action on climate change
3062,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," They can include goal setting, strategic programming, capitalization, partnership management, project approval, policy assurance, financial control and performance measurement"
3063,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each should be considered carefully
3064,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The functions of an NCF influence its components and services
3065,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," An NCF with ill-designed functions runs the risk of not only failing to reach its goals, but of undermining progress toward low-emission, climate-resilient development"
3066,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
In UNDP's experience, there are a number of core functions that are common to any funding mechanism, including NCFs"
3067,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," First, an NCF should enhance or provide a system that supports goal setting and the development of programmatic strategies on climate change"
3068,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By setting in place a process that aligns and supports existing general goals and strategic programmes, the NCF can provide a coordinated supporting structure to a country's national climate and development priorities"
3069,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Further, by facilitating regular discussions and stakeholder engagement on national climate issues, an NCF can serve as a central body for discussion and decision-making about how the NCF will support national action"
3070,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
An NCF should provide for fundraising toward climate priorities"
3071,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Indeed, the capitalization of the NCF — its ability to collect and raise funds — is one of the core functions that make an NCF a useful tool for implementing low-emission, climate-resilient development"
3072,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," As demonstrated in Chapter 2, capitalization can take a variety of forms and can utilize public, private, multilateral, bilateral and innovative sources of finance"
3073,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
An NCF can provide a mechanism for managing partnerships by clearly defining and coordinating the roles of various climate change stakeholders"
3074,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The NCF can complement and support the management of relationships with other financing mechanisms, such as those under the UNFCCC or with other multilateral, bilateral, public and private sources"
3075,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, It can also ensure the clear management of the responsibilities of stakeholders at all levels and across climate change initiatives
3076,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
NCFs can provide a coordinated project approval and implementation structure for climate change programming"
3077,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Uniform project cycle guidelines that clearly outline the technical and eligibility requirements support streamlined operations
3078,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Well-conceived guidelines can facilitate the transparent approval process of NCF climate change initiatives
3079,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Moreover, an NCF can supply systems to ensure that quality standards are met throughout its operations"
3080,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs offer policy assurance through social and environmental safeguards, financial controls that ensure fiscal monitoring and reporting and performance measurement that outlines specific performance criteria and then evaluates projects and programmes to ensure that the NCF delivers effectively and efficiently"
3081,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The NCF can become an important source of knowledge and information management that consolidates and disseminates lessons from climate change projects and programmes"
3082,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The exchange of such information can build capacity, help projects implement good practices and spur innovative solutions to implement country-driven priorities on climate change"

3086,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds and more than 40 multi-donor trust funds, six common components have been identified that provide the basic skeleton for any NCF: objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary management, implementation arrangements and monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV)"
3087,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Chapter 2 of this guidebook focuses on a step-by-step decision-making process for the design of each component"
3088,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, A description of each component is accompanied by a series of targeted questions that facilitate decision-making for that element
3089,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The end of Chapter 2 brings all of these decisions together into a term sheet that facilitates stakeholder engagement and consolidates stakeholder inputs on each component
3090,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
NCFs are not ""one-size-fits-all,"" but many funds arrange the components into a common structure to support the delivery of NCF services"
3091,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The structure includes funding sources, governing bodies, a trustee and implementers"
3092,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Funding sources provide funds to the NCF while the governing bodies make decisions about the operations of the fund
3093,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The trustee manages the transfers of funds to and from the NCF's bank account
3094,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Implementers receive funds and ensure activities are undertaken
3095,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each of these agents supports the delivery of actions to achieve the strategic priorities of the NCF
3096,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
UNDP has developed a structural overview (Figure 3) that demonstrates how these components can be arranged and the various design questions that must be answered"
3097,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Resources, coordination, support and MRV flow between sources, governing bodies, the trustee, implementers and recipients"
3098,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Throughout each component, stakeholders should consider how the NCF will deliver its services and what structural components and design decisions are necessary to support the achievement of the NCF's priorities"
3099,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

A set of governing bodies is usually at the centre of an NCF"
3100,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Often, a steering committee or other group makes decisions on the disbursal of funds and oversees the high-level activities of the fund, including policy and operational guidelines, strategic direction and reporting"
3101,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," This group is often made up of multiple ministries, such as environment, planning and finance, and representatives from civil society, the United Nations, development banks, private sector or other partners"
3102,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The chair person of the steering committee can be a government representative or other participant
3103,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The steering committee is usually supported by two other governing bodies, a technical group that provides substantive reviews of project proposals and a secretariat that manages day-to-day operations of the NCF"
3104,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
In a majority of funds, resources flow from the sources to the trustee, which holds them on behalf of the NCF"
3105,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," When the governing bodies make decisions about how the funds should be allocated, the steering committee will direct the trustee to distribute the funds to the implementing entities"
3106,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The implementers conduct the projects and the recipients receive the benefits
3107,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The implementers then report on their activities to the governing bodies
3108,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In the case of loans, the loans will be repaid back to the trustee"
3109,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The NCF structure can be tailored to align with its designated functions and national priorities"
3110,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Depending on the objectives of an NCF, specialized systems can be put in place to manage financial flows"
3111,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, if a fund capitalizes national banks to provide low-cost loans for projects such as renewable energy, it may assign the government as the source of funds and the national banks the trustee"
3112,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, MRV would be conducted by the banks according to their lending criteria
3113,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In the case of an NCF using innovative financing mechanisms, such as taxes on bunker fuels, to support activities, the infrastructure must be set up in order to accommodate the collection and distribution of these funds"
3114,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This kind of flexibility helps each entity associated with the NCF to fulfill the role that best supports the objectives of the fund
3115,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The relationship between the NCF's various bodies must be carefully defined through the design process so that each decision is implemented efficiently and promotes national climate and development objectives"
3116,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The flows of funds, support and coordination of an NCF should align with its objectives so that the fund can operate smoothly"
3117,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Relationships with the private sector and civil society should also be considered and clarified"
3118,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In some NCFs, the private sector and/or civil society play important roles in the fund's structure, including serving as a donor, an implementer or a representative on a governing body"
3119,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In cases where the private sector or a civil society group has met the necessary fiduciary standards, they can also serve as the trustee"
3120,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

















































































Importantly, NCFs must be firmly rooted in national realities"
3121,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, National priorities and circumstances provide an important context for NCF delivery and can lead to opportunities and challenges as an NCF becomes operational
3122,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," To provide stability, NCFs should take this into account by aligning with national climate change strategies, institutions, frameworks and stakeholders; however, NCFs must also have the flexibility to adjust overtime"
3123,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Maintaining both stability and flexibility is imperative to stakeholder engagement"
3124,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Throughout the design phase of an NCF, stakeholder consultations are critical to ensure that the NCF is robust and effective"
3125,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Including various government, multilateral, bilateral, private and civil society actors in the development and establishment of the NCF helps to more clearly identify needs and requirements and to accommodate best practices"
3126,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"


















Programmatic and Management Objectives

As a first step in setting up an NCF, a country must identify its strategic goals on climate change and how the NCF will help it to achieve these goals"
3127,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The NCF may serve the country by driving resources to national climate activities, such as mitigation, adaptation, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), capacity building, technology building or other priorities"
3128,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," An NCF’s objectives may also include attracting private sector investment, or formalizing a system to collect resources from “polluter pays” policies that collect revenue from industry"
3129,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
An NCF’s objectives provide the foundation for its operations and outcomes"
3130,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," When setting objectives, a country should take into account its national climate and development strategies, as well as other analyses and plans, such as the National Communications, National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs), National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally-Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), to identify the priorities of a National Climate Fund"
3131,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," These analyses can bring together current thinking on climate change, as well as focus the NCF on priority issues and sectors where activities can be undertaken in a cost-effective way"
3132,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
It is critical that objectives take into account the technical and political considerations that may support or hamper the NCF’s progress over time"
3133,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Thematic priorities, such as increasing renewable energy, must be supported by analyses of the feasibility of increasing investment in that sector"
3134,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Likewise, to achieve other priorities of the NCF, such as capacity building for direct access to climate funds under the UNFCCC, these aims must be acknowledged, and appropriate and supportive systems be put in place"
3135,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Carefully defined objectives must be supported by appropriate functions of the NCF"
3136,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If an NCF focuses on providing a type of “clearing house” for climate change initiatives, it may not be necessary to develop a complicated financial mechanism"
3137,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Likewise, if an NCF is to provide low-cost loans to a specific sector, it would not be necessary for the functions of the fund to include extensive coordination systems"
3138,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, A country can select the objectives that match its priorities but must ensure that the objectives are fully supported by the NCF's functions
3139,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

ALIGNING OBJECTIVES WITH OTHER PRIORITIES AND FUNDING WINDOWS

These programmatic considerations should be linked closely with fund management considerations and, importantly, how the NCF will relate to other international and domestic climate funds"
3140,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Some countries may have multiple NCFs that target specific issues — for example, one to provide funding for REDD activities and another for adaptation"
3141,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Others NCFs may be linked to more comprehensive, national strategies"
3142,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In Ethiopia, the Carbon-Neutral, Climate-Resilient Economy mission statement sets out how Ethiopia is responding to climate change and how it can transition toward low-carbon growth"
3143,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The government is considering setting up a national fund to support these activities
3144,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The NCF could be a funding arm and all activities under the NCF would link to Ethiopia's mission statement
3145,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In this model, the national strategy becomes the roadmap for the NCF"
3146,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The scope of the NCF must fully support its programmatic mission"
3147,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If a country has already acquired funds from a specific source, or funds have been earmarked for a specific activity, then it will be important to ensure that the structure of the NCF can channel this funding appropriately"
3148,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Similarly, if a country's goals are to optimize its relationships with stakeholders (e"
3149,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", the private sector) or funding programmes (e"
3150,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", the Clean Development Mechanism) it may be necessary to codify this in the objectives"
3151,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

FUND TIMELINE
Designing an NCF's objectives must also consider timelines"
3152,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If a national strategy or other funding mechanism is time-bound, this may affect the timeframe of the NCF"
3153,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This will be especially important as countries consider their options under the UNFCCC process
3154,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, if an NCF is designed to attract fast start funding, it is important to align the NCF with the 2012 deadline"
3155,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Likewise, the longer-term pledges of up to $100 billion per year by 2020 include a variety of sources, including private finance, and an NCF may wish to accommodate these circumstances accordingly"
3156,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Other NCFs may wish to align themselves with the specific timeframe of a national strategy
3157,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEFINING THE OBJECTIVES:
1"
3158,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," What are the national priorities on climate change? Are there short, medium or long-term strategies that the NCF should support (including national strategies, NAMAs, etc"
3159,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,")?
2"
3160,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Will the fund focus on thematic priorities (e
3161,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", renewable energy) or support broader objectives?
3"
3162,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," How will the objectives of the fund relate to the objectives of other international and domestic funds?
4"
3163,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," What timeframe is most appropriate? Should the NCF be time-bound?
5"
3164,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," What are the expected financial flows to the fund? Have funds already been pledged? Have these funds been earmarked toward a specific activity that should be acknowledged?
6"
3165,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Are there stakeholders that must be acknowledged in the objectives? (e
3166,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", those associated with a specific industry)
7"
3167,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Should the objectives acknowledge a relationship with an entity or programme?
(e"
3168,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", Clean Development Mechanism)

Building on the fund’s objectives, a country should consider the types of resources that would best capitalize the fund"
3169,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Indeed, deciding where the funds will come from is one of the most important choices that will shape the NCF"
3170,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Many sources of finance — including international, national, public and private — can be delivered through an NCF, but they must build on existing frameworks and be supported by appropriate structures to access and channel funding efficiently"
3171,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
LINKING OBJECTIVES AND CAPITALIZATION
Fund capitalization must be realistic, grounded in the objectives and functions of the NCF"
3172,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Funds with ambitious objectives must have clear expectations of how the fund will be capitalized and the objectives supported
3173,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Designers of NCFs should exercise caution in this regard: expectations of co-financing and leveraging must be based on national circumstances
3174,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Likewise, funds with smaller, targeted objectives should not aim to access billions when it is not appropriate for the scope of the NCF"
3175,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Generally, if a fund has a broad set of objectives, it usually blends together a broader array of sources than more targeted NCFs"
3176,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," An NCF with wide objectives — for example, supporting all of the activities under a low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy — may aim to collect funds from international and national sources so that a wide variety of activities can be covered"
3177,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A fund with a more targeted mission will often only focus on a single source, such as those from one bilateral partner"
3178,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"





































INNOVATIVE FINANCING MECHANISMS
A country may also want to consider the use of innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for an NCF"
3179,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In this case, an NCF is designed to collect resources from non-traditional sources of finance such as levies on oil or coal production, fees from polluting companies or proceeds from carbon markets"
3180,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Revenues from these sources are collected by an NCF and then directed toward the programmes and projects that fulfill the goals of the NCF
3181,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, the Brazil National Fund on Climate Change collects funds from revenue from the oil production industry and channels them toward climate change mitigation and adaptation activities"
3182,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Innovative mechanisms require that complementary structures be put in place within the NCF to ensure the efficient collection and delivery of funds"
3183,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, NCFs should have the ability to manage and account for funds coming from these non-traditional sources
3184,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

CONSIDERING CONTEXT
With both traditional and innovative sources, it is critical to consider national circumstances in order to optimize capitalization"
3185,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Laws or policies may be required to access and collect certain types of funding
3186,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A tax on an industry, for example, may need to be mandated by a national law that clarifies the rates of taxation"
3187,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Understanding and acknowledging national circumstances is especially important when considering the involvement of the private sector"
3188,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By aligning with existing private sector regulations and incentive structures, for example, the NCF can stimulate and attract private investment by driving public finance toward commercially attractive projects"
3189,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This helps the NCF to contribute toward sound investment and policy decisions that direct private finance toward activities that address national climate and development priorities
3190,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
A country should also consider any available resources that could already feed directly into the NCF or any existing partnerships with donors"
3191,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A country may wish for the NCF to absorb these resources or partnerships, or to align with them so that activities will be undertaken in a coordinated manner"
3192,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If the NCF does absorb them, it is important to note whether they are ""earmarked"" toward specific activities — such as capacity building — that will affect the operations of the fund"
3193,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"





The capitalization of the fund has implications for the size, governance and implementation of the fund"
3194,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, if the private sector provides resources to the fund, then it may be necessary to include private sector representatives in the governance system"
3195,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Furthermore, a number of legal contracts or systems will need to be established in order to collect resources from specific sources"
3196,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For innovative funds, enacting laws, policies or partnership agreements may also be necessary for the efficient capitaliza- tion of an NCF"
3197,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Countries should also consider how additional resources will be raised throughout the life of the fund"
3198,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Some NCFs use a regular fundraising cycle while others adopt the cycles associated with specific sources
3199,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING CAPITALIZATION:
1"
3200,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Based on the objectives of the fund, what kinds of sources will be blended together to capitalize the NCF?
2"
3201,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Will the fund utilize innovative sources, such as levies?
3"
3202,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Will donor funds be allocated to specific activities? (e
3203,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", capacity building, institutional
strengthening, investment)
4"
3204,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Are there any existing sources that could readily feed into an NCF?
5"
3205,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Will the size and sources of capitalization impact the size, governance or implementing arrangements of the fund?
6"
3206,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Are there specific structures necessary to support the fund’s capitalization? (e
3207,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", laws or policies, partnership agreements)
7"
3208,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Will there be a regular process or cycle for raising funds? How will additional sources be attracted?






































Building on the objectives and capitalization of the NCF, countries must identify the appropriate governance system that will optimize the fund's performance"
3209,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Establishing governing bodies, decision-making processes and oversight can facilitate efficient management of the fund in order to drive resources toward implementation"
3210,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
First, a country must consider the scope of the NCF's governance"
3211,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If the NCF has a horizontal structure, the governance system should be inclusive of stakeholders and provide coordination among partners"
3212,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If the NCF is a vertical institution, the governance arrangements may require more stringent reporting and management structures"
3213,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"







GOVERNING BODIES






As discussed previously, many NCFs have a set of governing bodies that make decisions on fund management and strategic direction"
3214,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The bodies within the governance system must have clear roles that effectively support the NCF without adding increased burden or bottlenecks in the programming cycle
3215,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The scope of the bodies should align with the scope of the objectives
3216,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," An NCF that supports a comprehensive low-emission, climate-resilient development strategy will require a governance system that is equally compre- hensive"
3217,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," On the other hand, if an NCF supports a more targeted objective with limited stakeholders, then the scope of the gover- nance system could also be limited"
3218,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Though not required, many NCFs have a high-level steering committee, chaired by the government, which provides guid- ance and oversight to the fund"
3219,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The steering committee is usually supported by a technical group that provides a substantive review of proposals to the NCF, and by a secretariat that conducts day-to- day operations"
3220,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, A technical group is made up of substantive experts who evaluate project proposals and provide recommendations to the steering committee
3221,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The secretariat schedules meetings, corre- sponds with stakeholders, prepares documentation for meetings Both play an important role in supporting the steering committee
Some governments may have existing bodies, frameworks or systems in place that can serve as portions of the governance structure"
3222,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A previously established inter-ministerial climate change committee, for example, can take on the role of the steering committee"
3223,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Or, an existing body within a government ministry may also provide technical expertise or secretariat services"
3224,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Moreover, when multiple environ- ment or climate change funds exist in a country, the governance structure of one fund can support the operations of others"
3225,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Guidelines pertaining to representation on an NCF’s governing bodies should be established during the design phase"
3226,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Many governments choose to have representatives from the sources and implementers, as well as the trustee, on the steering committee"
3227,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This can help to ensure that all parts of the fund are coordinated and streamlined
3228,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Representation guidelines should also carefully outline the role of non- government stakeholders
3229,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Depending on the objectives of the fund, non-government representatives can have decision-making abilities alongside the government, or they may participate as observers"
3230,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

























SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF FUNDING PROPOSALS
The process for submitting and approving proposals should be closely linked to the roles of the governing bodies"
3231,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Identifying who can submit proposals and who approves them will establish the lifecycle of a project proposal
3232,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, the China CDM Fund is governed by an inter-ministerial board made up of the Ministry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Agriculture and China Meteorological Administration"
3233,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The collection, management and use of the funds are the responsibility of a Management Centre affiliated with the Ministry of Finance"
3234,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Projects are submitted to the Management Centre which then sends them to the NDRC for review and recommendations
3235,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The recommendations are then sent to the entire board for approval
3236,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
As demonstrated by this example, the relationships between governing bodies should be clarified to ensure that decision-making is efficient"
3237,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In many cases, proposals are received by the secretariat, reviewed by a technical group and the technical group's recommendations are forwarded to the steering committee for approval"
3238,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each body has a defined role to support the decision-making process
3239,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Ultimate oversight and of the fund must also be clarified
3240,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, in many NCFs, the Steering Committee is responsible for the delivery of the fund"
3241,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In other NCFs, a government body or other agent may have this role"
3242,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR INSTILLING EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE:
1"
3243,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," What governing bodies are necessary to ensure efficient operations of the fund?
Who reports to whom?
2"
3244,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," How will any existing inter-ministerial or other high-level national body relate to the fund?
3"
3245,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Who will be represented in the governing bodies? (e
3246,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", government, private sector, civil society, United Nations, development banks, donors, other development partners)

9"
3252,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In the case where there is more than one national environment/climate fund in a country, how do the governing bodies of these funds relate to one another?





























Sound fiduciary management provides the foundation for the efficient movement and tracking of funds flowing to and from the NCF"
3253,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," As the number of sources in the climate finance landscape continues to expand, an NCF must have a system of fiduciary management that accommodates the multiple standards, project cycles and scale of risks of climate change projects"
3254,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
DEFINING FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Fiduciary arrangements facilitate relationships between different actors in the NCF structure"
3255,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, An NCF could be potentially coordinating the disbursement of funds to multiple implementers that have different fiduciary standards from the NCF and from each other
3256,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, It is critical that decision-makers consider how fidu- ciary standards will apply to these various actors
3257,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Some NCFs choose to have tailored fiduciary standards for different types of implementers or projects
3258,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, an NCF may wish to have a different set of fiduciary standards for a multilateral implementer than for an implementer from the private sector"
3259,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, They may also wish to have certain fiduciary standards for a large project that differ from those for a smaller project with lower risk
3260,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"










Some funds have a ""one size fits all"" approach where an NCF sets out fiduciary principles that every implementer must apply to their operations"
3261,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The standards can be as stringent or flexible as necessary
3262,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," However, NCF designers should take into account that the various types of stakeholders — government entities, private sector, multilateral entities and others — may have varying degrees of flexibility to adopt these standards"
3263,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

MANAGER OF FIDUCIARY ARRANGEMENTS
Usually a trustee or administrative agent manages an NCF's transactions and ensures that funds are collected and distributed in a coordinated and effective manner"
3264,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," To do this, the trustee provides a number of fund management services, including receiving contributions from various sources, disbursing funds to each participating entity on behalf of the steering committee (or other decision-making body), investing funds that are not yet disbursed and providing financial reporting"
3265,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The trustee does not make decisions on what projects should be funded by the NCF
3266,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Rather, it holds the funds in an account and receives instructions from the steering committee for the timing and direction of distribution"
3267,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Often, the trustee coordinates the legal contracts and agreements that underpin the transactions of funds"
3268,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, It ensures that the NCF meets all legal and fiduciary standards for collecting and distributing funds
3269,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
A national or international body can serve as the trustee"
3270,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For some NCFs, the trustee is a national development entity"
3271,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For instance, the trustee for the Amazon Fund of Brazil is the Brazil National Development Bank (BNDES)"
3272,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, BNDES coordinates donations and distributes funds
3273,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Other funds, such as Guyana's REDD+ Investment Fund, use the World Bank as their trustee"
3274,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Still others, such as the Ecuador Yasuni ITT Trust Fund, use the United Nations (UN) system"
3275,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Importantly, if the body selected as the trustee plays additional roles within the NCF, such as for supporting implementation, the NCF should be designed to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest"
3276,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Even if the trustee is an external development partner, NCF designers must clarify the relationship between the trustee and government or domestic financial institutions"
3277,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, A national body may wish to engage with the fiduciary management of the NCF in order to support delivery of funds
3278,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," This can include oversight functions, capacity building or MRV of funds"
3279,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The trustee may provide a number of other administrative services beyond collecting and distributing funds and legal documentation"
3280,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This may include gathering and disseminating of data on projects to which funds are distributed
3281,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Further, some trustees play a critical role in reporting by consolidating progress reports submitted by implementing entities"
3282,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, These updates are distributed along with financial reports to the steering committee or other body
3283,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Almost all trustees require a fee for their services"
3284,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Fees can range from 1 to 5% of funds managed
3285,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Countries should take this into consideration as the agreement with the trustee is established
3286,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Capacity development can be another critical function of fiduciary management"
3287,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Many countries begin with an international body as the trustee but plan to transition this role to a domestic entity in the future
3288,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For this to occur, it is critical that the trustee work closely with national institutions to strengthen domestic fund management so that countries meet international fiduciary standards"
3289,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," This close part- nership will support a smooth transition from one trustee to another, and will maintain a coordinated, predictable funding stream"
3290,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENSURING SOUND FIDUCIARY MANAGEMENT:

( Implementation Arrangements



Implementation arrangements — the processes and agents set in place to implement climate change programming — must support the objectives of the NCF and align closely with the other key design decisions"
3300,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
SCOPE OF IMPLEMENTATION
Identifying what kinds of programmatic instruments — such as grants or loans — will be used to implement the projects establishes the scope of implementation"
3301,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," While many NCFs collect funds and then distribute them as grants, others have diversified their activities to include low-cost loans"
3302,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, the Thailand Energy Efficiency Revolving Fund distributed a pool of government funds to private banks which then provided low-cost loans for energy efficiency"
3303,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Once the loans were repaid, the money became available for new loans"
3304,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This continual repayment of the initial loan cycle has supported additional loans
3305,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"



There are many options for identifying the programmatic instru- ments, such as grants and loans, for delivery of NCF funds"
3306,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Governments should take stock of their legal and financial tools in order to identify what types of services the NCF can provide
3307,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The role of national banks should be considered, as the ability for the NCF to capitalize lending institutions will have implications for the financial management of the fund"
3308,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In order to provide loans, the bank would need to meet international fiduciary standards, and risk and profit sharing arrangements with the NCF would need to be established"
3309,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
IMPLEMENTERS
Selecting implementers for an NCF should occur in a systematic and transparent way"
3310,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For many NCFs, project implementers are approved or accredited by the steering committee and can then apply for funding for specific projects"
3311,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," If project applications are approved, the steering committee directs the trustee to release the funds to the implementing entity"
3312,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Using the NCF objectives as a guide, a number of organizations or bodies can serve as implementing entities"
3313,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs can specify that implementation should be carried out by a government ministry or other agent, similar to the manner in which the Adaptation Fund allows accredited entities to directly access funds for implementation"
3314,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Other options include United Nations agencies, development banks, civil society or the private sector to deliver activities"
3315,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

Depending on the objectives of the fund, implementation can also occur by using combinations of these actors through, for example, public-private partnerships"
3316,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Arrangements like this support the objectives of the fund by establishing flexible systems to ensure that implementation is coordinated and efficient
3317,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
As with the trustee, implementers require a fee for their services"
3318,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Fees can range from 5 to 13% of the projects’ costs
3319,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
ALIGNING IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
With all implementers, it is critical that the programmatic cycle is as streamlined as possible to avoid potential “double” project cycles where the NCF would have one project cycle and the implementers another"
3320,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Projects must be able to move through the system as efficiently as possible in order to avoid unnecessary delays or bottlenecks
3321,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"




































Further, given that many NCFs will operate alongside international climate funds such as the Global Environment Facility, Adaptation Fund and Green Climate Fund, or other funds at the national or subnational level, it is important that an NCF's implementing arrangements align with the implementing arrangements of other funds"
3322,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," This will reduce transaction costs and should contribute to knowledge sharing, since some implementers under the NCF may also be implementers under other funds"
3323,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
It is worth noting that, in some funds, the recipient of the fund and the implementer are separate entities"
3324,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Some NCFs distribute funds to government bodies that sub-contract the implementation work

Key Decision 6: Facilitating Effective Monitoring, Reporting and Verification
Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) is a critical component of an NCF"
3337,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," MRV enables the NCF to ensure that results are being delivered, and to collect lessons learned from implementation that will further refine and improve NCF operations"
3338,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The NCF should have unambiguous appraisal and performance criteria"
3339,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each stakeholder responsible for providing information on the activities of the NCF must have clear guidelines and standards
3340,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Public infor- mation systems can often support the dissemination of information
3341,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
PROGRAMMATIC AND FINANCIAL REPORTING
Two types of reporting are necessary"
3342,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," First, the activities implemented must be reviewed and data submitted on the results of those activities"
3343,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Generally, this is conducted in a bottom-up manner by the implementers, which report activities to one of the governing bodies"
3344,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," However, in some NCFs the governing bodies may collect data in a top-down manner by visiting project sites, carrying out evalua- tions or commissioning audits"
3345,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
In the case of project reporting, MRV should be systematized across the NCF"
3346,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Guidelines and templates should be established so each implementer reports on a similar set of metrics
3347,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This data should be collected by one governing body that can compile the information for further analysis and identification of best practices
3348,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Also, institutional arrangements, including the roles of who will be conducting the MRV and who will be compiling the information, should be clarified"
3349,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Second, the status of the finances of the NCF must be reported by the trustee"
3350,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The trustee often provides this information to the secretariat or steering committee on a regular basis
3351,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, An NCF may choose to monitor the status of its finances through a series of regular reports or using web-based financial tracking tools
3352,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This real-time tracking supports transparency and access to information
3353,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
ALIGNING MRV SYSTEMS
Similar to the implementing arrangements, MRV systems should align with other domestic and global climate change funds, as well as any MRV requirements of NAMAs, NAPs and other relevant mecha- nisms"
3354,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," This helps the NCF MRV system to be cost-effective, robust and to minimize the reporting burden on NCF implementers"
3355,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
NCF MRV systems should also be aligned within the fund to ensure that there are clear roles for oversight and audit functions"
3356,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The body with legal responsibility over implementation and achieving results should be identified and should ensure that the MRV systems optimize the use of existing national systems
3357,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"























Moreover, some NCFs may wish to use MRV as a way to incentivize results"
3358,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By aligning MRV with project effectiveness, NCFs can use the information collected as a basis for future funding for the project"
3359,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," For example, in the case of performance-based funds, projects receive initial funding but future support is based on the results achieved"
3360,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, This model can promote accountability and provide incentives for recipients to use funds efficiently
3361,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT
Many MRV systems are new to governments and project implementers that have not been a part of previous MRV systems"
3362,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Importantly, any MRV mechanisms established should provide tools,
                                  methodologies, training and knowledge sharing to help countries strengthen their technical and institutional capacity for developing effective MRV systems"
3363,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
CRITICAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR FACILITATING, MONITORING, REPORTING AND VERIFICATION:
1"

3371,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," What types of guidance materials are available or need to be created? What MRV capacity building activities should be undertaken?

Consolidating Inputs into Term Sheets
To support efficient, transparent and robust NCF design, UNDP recommends consolidating the design decisions of an NCF into a term sheet organized to capture of the different components featured in this guidebook"
3372,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A term sheet is a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the design and operations of the fund, including the objectives, capitalization, governance, fiduciary manage- ment, implementation arrangements and MRV"
3373,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Capturing the objectives and the functional attributes in this way can help to clearly define the scope and administration of the fund so that it effectively supports country objectives
3374,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, An annotated example term sheet is in Figure 5
3375,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
While many NCF term sheets follow a similar structure, the decision points in a term sheet can be tailored to accommodate NCF components that support national needs and priorities"
3376,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By consolidating design decisions on the components of the fund, the term sheet helps to outline the project cycle and reporting arrangements"
3377,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It also provides a means to codify agreements regarding fees charged by the trustee and implementing entities, if applicable"
3378,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Importantly, term sheets can be used to facilitate engagement with stakeholders during the design process"
3379,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By outlining each element of the NCF, the document can serve as a structure for discussion and help internal and external stakeholders contribute specific and targeted inputs"
3380,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
The information captured in the term sheet can also provide a basis for agreement among fund participants"
3381,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The term sheet can help formalize relationships between NCF sources, governing bodies, implementers and recipients"
3382,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It can also outline the flow of funds, as well as the decision-making systems that shape the relationships between the fund’s participants (e"
3383,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,", who reports to whom and how funds are allocated)"
3384,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By codifying this information, the term sheet identifies and clarifies roles, responsibilities and expectations for each part of the NCF"
3385,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Through experience, UNDP has learned that term sheets provide a simple, step-by-step tool that can be used as a basis for discussion and agreement throughout the life of the NCF"

Conclusion
Countries have immense opportunities to utilize climate finance — more sources of funding exist than ever before to help countries achieve their climate change objectives"
3473,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," However, in order for this increased funding to achieve real results, countries must be equipped to effectively access and channel funds toward their climate and development priorities"
3474,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," It is critical that the increased number of funding sources are matched with an increase in a country's ability to collect, blend, coordinate and account for climate finance"
3475,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
As this guidebook demonstrates, National Climate Funds are a useful tool that can support countries to optimize their access to and management of climate finance"
3476,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs are nationally-owned and nationally- managed so that a country can collect the sources that are right for them, blend them together, impie ment activities in a manner that accomplishes their priorities and set up a nationally-relevant system to account for the results of their work"
3477,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," NCFs put countries in the driving seat for transforming their economies and achieving low-emission, climate-resilient development"
3478,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Based on UNDP's experience in the administration of over 750 trust funds at the national, global and regional levels, and 40 Multi-Donor Trust Funds around the world, there is a set of key decisions that a country must consider when designing and establishing an NCF:
• Defining the objectives
• Identifying capitalization
• Instilling effective governance
• Ensuring sound fiduciary management
• Supporting efficient implementation arrangements
• Facilitating effective monitoring, reporting and verification
Once key decisions have been made, a country will have crafted the components of its NCF; these components will provide a structure that helps to drive resources toward a country's climate and development priorities"
3479,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," A carefully considered and well-designed NCF will ensure that systems are in place to facilitate the flow of funds and monitoring, reporting and verification"
3480,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Further, support and coordination should underscore all of an NCF's components, ensuring that efficient decision-making supports the implementation of projects and programmes that achieve the NCF's goals"
3481,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Importantly, NCFs are not one-size-fits-all"
3482,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Each NCF must be tailored to country priorities and realities
3483,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," They should be firmly rooted in, and aligned with, existing national strategies, frameworks, systems and other initiatives on climate change"
3484,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, NCFs must also define the fund's relationship to other global funds and programmes so that the NCF can make the best use of available resources and avoid duplicating other efforts
3485,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"

In UNDP's experience, the use of a term sheet helps to define the design and operations of the NCF by capturing the key considerations of each of its components"
3486,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," As a document that outlines critical pieces of information about the operations and scope of the fund, a term sheet supports an efficient, transparent and robust NCF design"
3487,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," While the questions posed by a term sheet are universal, the answers will be unique to each country"
3488,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Stakeholder engagement is a critical part of the design and establishment of NCFs"
3489,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Government, civil society, academia, the United Nations, development banks, the private sector and others can contribute specific and targeted inputs so that the NCF operates as efficiently as possible"
3490,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Term sheets are also useful for this purpose — they can provide a structure for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that all voices are heard, and that roles, responsibilities and expectations are defined clearly"
3491,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Capacity development is also a key element of any NCF"
3492,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," The NCF should support on-going capacity development of governing bodies, implementers, the trustee and other stakeholders so that they can drive results and continue to build robust systems that address the country's climate change priorities over time"
3493,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Capacity development is especially important as more global funds include opportunities for countries to access funds directly
3494,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, Countries can use NCFs to strengthen national institutions and align with international fiduciary standards so that they can meet the criteria associated with those funds
3495,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
Throughout this guidebook, a number of existing NCFs have been featured"
3496,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, It is important to learn from their experiences and build on lessons from their NCF design and establishment process
3497,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, A key lesson applicable to all countries designing an NCF is to be very clear about what the NCF should accomplish
3498,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," Countries must realistically assess their needs: in some cases the NCF should be very broad and attract many different types of funding sources; in others, a more targeted NCF is necessary to focus on a key priority for the country"
3499,UNDPP-2011-1.txt, The targeted NCF can be capitalized by a limited number of funding sources in order to decrease administrative and operating costs
3500,UNDPP-2011-1.txt,"
NCFs help countries to manage climate finance and to achieve their sustainable development goals"
3501,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," By creating an NCF, a country sets in place a system that efficiently collects, blends, coordinates and accounts for climate finance, helping it to take advantage of the increased number of climate funding sources available"
3502,UNDPP-2011-1.txt," In this way, NCFs help countries to manage climate finance catalytically and build a system that supports low-emission and climate-resilient development now and in the future"

3960,UNEP-2007-2.txt," To increase the chance of success, policy-makers may:
■ Stimulate political will, through public awareness, education, and conflict-mediation systems;
■ Create the necessary legislative basis and environmental judiciary, minimize delays between policy decisions and implementation, and ensure sustainable financing systems are safeguarded from corruption;
■ Strengthen and reinforce the capacity of agencies and staff operating at local, national and international level;
■ Decentralize power to the lowest level appropriate for the decision, where it is usually more timely and meaningful;
■ Involve relevant stakeholders, such as through formal or informal partnerships, and transfer authority to stakeholders who have a relative advantage, stake and competence in assuming the responsibility;
■ Support and facilitate the active participation of women, local communities and marginalized and vulnerable groups in decision making;
■ Support research, monitoring, and information networking and develop specific management objectives, selecting appropriate and measurable indicators, and monitoring and assessing progress against these objectives"

4125,UNEP-2007-6.txt,"



The responsibility for the mounting global environmental pressures is not equally distributed throughout the world"
4126,UNEP-2007-6.txt," For instance, in 2004, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Annex 1 countries with 20 per cent of world population, produced 57 per cent of gross world product based on purchasing power parity and accounted for 46 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions"
4127,UNEP-2007-6.txt," Changing drivers and pressures, including the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas, the widening gap between the richest and the poorest, and growth in demand for energy, among other factors, have led to a deepening disparity in consumption patterns and in outsourcing of environmentally damaging production processes"
4128,UNEP-2007-6.txt,"
Long term sustainable development aimed at improving human well-being entails:
■ increasing the asset base and its productivity;

Innovations and emerging solutions

For many problems, the benefits from early and ambitious action outweigh the costs"
4461,UNEP-2007-6.txt, Scenarios on future global environmental changes suggest that implementing determined action in the present is cheaper than waiting for better solutions to come along
4462,UNEP-2007-6.txt," Delayed action also unfairly shifts the burden of paying such costs onto future generations, contradicting the principle of inter-generational equity"

Three main markets are emerging for payments for ecosystem services:
■ Watershed management, which may include control of floods, erosion, access to nutrients, sedimentation and water quality, as veil as maintenance of aquatic habitats and dry season flows;
■ biodiversity protection, which includes eco-label led products, ecotourism and payments for conservation of wildlife habitat;
■ Carbon sequestration, in which, for example, international buyers pay to plant new trees to absorb carbon, offsetting carbon emissions elsewhere"
4496,UNEP-2007-6.txt,"

Indicative of the growing interest in market mechanisms, the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2006 witnessed a booming global carbon market worth over U$$ 10 billion, 10 times the value of the previous year and more than the value of the entire US wheat crop in 2005 (US$7"

The Copenhagen Accord declared that deep cut: in global emissions are required ""so as to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees Celsius"""
4542,UNEP-2010-1.txt," The Accord called for an assessment that would consider strengthening the long-term goal including ""temperature rises of J,5 degrees"""
4543,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Since December 2009 140 countries have associated themselves with the Copenhagen Accord
4544,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Of these, 85 countries have pledged to reduce their emissions or constrain their growth up to 2020,
The question remains, however, whether these pledges are sufficient to achieve	* COPlb • COPENHAGEN •
the Accord's temperature limits, or if there will be a gap between what is needed and what is expected as a result of the pledges"
4545,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
Many scientific groups have identified global emission pathways2, or emissions trajectories, that are consistent with various temperature limits, while others have estimated global emissions in 2020 based on the Copenhagen Accord pledges"
4546,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Some groups have calculated both
4547,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Not surprisingly, different groups have come up with different estimates"
4548,UNEP-2010-1.txt," The range of estimates is caused, for example, by the fact that some of the pledges have conditions attached, such as the provision of finance and technology or ambitious action from other countries"

4550,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
To understand and interpret the range of result: coming from different studies, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in conjunction with the European Climate Foundation and the National Institute of Ecology, Mexico, convened a six-month preliminary assessment of these studies"

This assessment addresses four main questions:
■ What 2020 emission levels are consistent with the 2°C and 1"
4556,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"5°C limits?
■ What are the expected global emissions in 2020?
■ How big is the""emissions gap""?
■ How can the gap be reduced?
 4 Although the Copenhagen Accord is not explicit about the baseline against which temperature increase shoud be measured, we have assumed that it is pre-industrial levels"
4557,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"

Key findings
- Studies show that emission levels of approximately 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtC02e) (range: 39-44 GtC02e*) in 2020 would be consistent with a ""likely"" chance of limiting global warming to2° C"
4558,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- Under business-as-usual projections, global emissions could reach 56 GtC02e (range: 54-60 GtC02e) in 2020, leaving a gap of 12 GtC02e"
4559,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- If the lowest-ambition pledges were implemented in a ""lenient"" fashion**, emissions could be lowered slightly to 53 GtC02e (range: 52-57 GtC02e), leaving a significant gap of 9 GtC02e"
4560,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- The gap could be reduced substantially by policy options being discussed in the negotiations:
> By countries moving to higher ambition, conditional pledges
> By the negotiations adopting rules that avoid a net increase in emissions from (a) ""lenient"" accounting of land use, land-use change and forestry activities and (b) the use of surplus emission units
- If the above policy options were to be implemented, emissions in 2020 could be lowered to 49 GtC02e (range: 47-51 GtC02e), reducing the size of the gap to 5 GtC02e"
4561,UNEP-2010-1.txt," This is approximately equal to the annual global emissions from all the world's cars, buses and transport in 2005 - But this is also almost 60 per cent of the way towards reaching the2° C target"
4562,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- It will also be important to avoid increasing the gap by ""double counting"" of offsets"
4563,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- Studies show that it is feasible to bridge the remaining gap through more ambitious domestic actions, some of which could be supported by international climate finance"
4564,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
- With or without a gap, current studies indicate that steep emission reductions are needed post 2020 in order to keep our chances of limiting warming to2° C or 1"

** ""Lenient"" in this report is used to refer to the situation in which LULUCF accounting rules and the use of surplus emission units result in a net increase in emissions
Box 1 : Method for assessing emission levels consistent with temperature limits
In this assessment we examine two groups of pathways: (1) pathways produced by integrated assessment models (1AM), which simulate the energy-economic system including the turnover of energy infrastructure; and (2) ""stylized"" pathways, produced by other models that do not explicitly model the change in the energy system or feasibility of emission reduction rates"
4568,UNEP-2010-1.txt, We focus on results from lAMs because they are able to actually describe the system's response to different policies and measures and emission-related targets (see Box 2)
4569,UNEP-2010-1.txt," However, we also draw on ""stylized"" scenarios in order to better understand the theoretical rates of emission reduction and magnitude of negative emissions needed to be consistent with particular temperature limits"
4570,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
A total of 223 emission pathways produced by 15 modelling groups have been analysed"
4571,UNEP-2010-1.txt," We account for many, but not all, sources of the uncertainty of models and data by compiling results from a number of studies and identifying conclusions that appear robust"
4572,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"

What 2020 emission levels are consistent with the 2°C and 1 SX limits?
The level of human-induced global warming is primarily determined by the cumulative emissions over time, i"
4573,UNEP-2010-1.txt," when emissions peak, at what level, and how fast they decline thereafter"
4574,UNEP-2010-1.txt," 
The total stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has a strong effect on climate forcing related to climate change"
4575,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Tit is stock is determined by the accumulated emissions of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
4576,UNEP-2010-1.txt, It follows that cumulative emissions have a profound influence on the long-term increase of global temperature6
4577,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
An important point is that several different emission pathways can result in the same cumulative emissions over a period of time"
4578,UNEP-2010-1.txt," But nota II pathways are considered equally feasible; some are thought to be constrained by an upper ceiling on the rate of emission reductions due to technological, economic, social and political factors"
4579,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Hence, the feasibility of reduction rates plays a central role in determining which 2020 emission levels are consistent with temperature limits"
4580,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Also important are assumptions about the feasibility of ""negative emissions* i,e, the net removal of carbon dioxide iCO^} from the atmosphere through, for example, planting forests or capturing CO¿ from biomass {see Box3},
Studies show that there is a trade-off between the timing of the peak and the rate of decrease in emissions afterwards - tike sooner and lower the peak the slower the rate of decrease can be afterwards"
4581,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Conversely, the longer tike peak is delayed and tike higher it is, tike faster emissions must decline afterwards, and/or tike stronger tike negative emissions over tike long term, in order to stay with in tike temperature limit (see Figure A},
Many recent modelling studies have assumed that it would be unrealistic for global emissions to immediately start decreasing (because of political and economic factors) and therefore have focused on scenarios in which global emissions continue to increase for a few years and then decrease sharply afterwards"

Box 2: Understanding temperature limits
A temperature increase of 2° C or 1"
4583,UNEP-2010-1.txt,5° C represents an increase in global average near surface temperature compared with pre-industrial times
4584,UNEP-2010-1.txt, This is meant to be an indicator of local climate changes
4585,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Importantly, a 2° C or 1"
4586,UNEP-2010-1.txt,5° C global average increase can translate into much higher temperature changes locally
4587,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
There are significant uncertainties in the relationship between temperature, emission pathways, cumulative emissions, and atmospheric concentrations"
4588,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Therefore, in this assessment, each emission pathway is associated with a range of probabilities for temperature, reflecting uncertainties in the carbon cycle and many other aspects of the climate system"
4589,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Hence, an emission pathway is associated with probabilities of staying within a range of different temperature changes"
4590,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
To illustrate, an emission pathway that has a 50 per cent chance of limiting warming to under 2° C, may also have a 5 percent probability that warming will exceed 3°C and, say, a 10 percent probability of staying below 1"
4591,UNEP-2010-1.txt,5° C
4592,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Similarly, an emission pathway that has a 66 per cent chance of staying under 2° C, may also have a probability of less than 3 per cent that warming will exceed 3° C and, say, a 20 per cent probability of staying below 1"
4593,UNEP-2010-1.txt,5° C
4594,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
In this assessment we focus on emission pathways that lead to a global average temperature increase of less than 2° C over this century with a ""likely"" chance (greater than 66 per cent probability) and then explain how they would be different for a ""medium"" chance (50-66 per cent probability)"

Box 3"
4619,UNEP-2010-1.txt," What are feasible emission reduction rates? What are negative emissions?
The behaviour of the climate system dictates that future temperatures will be strongly influenced by emissions throughout the coming decades"
4620,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Hence, the consistency of 2020 emissions with a given temperature limit can only be judged if emissions after 2020 are taken into account"
4621,UNEP-2010-1.txt, For that reason it is important to know the feasible rates of emission reductions after 2020
4622,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Feasibility refers to whether a particular emission pathway is considered achievable
4623,UNEP-2010-1.txt," It depends upon technical, economic, political and social constraints and the extent of mitigation policy"
4624,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Some of these factors, in particular technological and economic feasibility, can be represented in models such as integrated assessment models (IAM)"
4625,UNEP-2010-1.txt," These include assumptions about the maximum feasible rate of introducing technology, maximum costs of technologies, feasibility of specific system configurations, and limits regarding behavioural changes"
4626,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Another important factor determining the maximum emissions reduction rate is the typical lifetime of machinery and infrastructure
4627,UNEP-2010-1.txt," These lifetimes are important if mitigation strategies aim to avoid premature replacement of capital, which is often considered to be very expensive"

There are different views about feasible emission reduction rates"
4630,UNEP-2010-1.txt, The highest average rate of emission reductions over the next four to five decades found in the 1AM literature is around 3
4631,UNEP-2010-1.txt,5 per cent per year
4632,UNEP-2010-1.txt, This would imply a decarbonisation rate (the rate of decrease in emissions per unit of GDP) of more than 6 per cent per year
4633,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Historically (1969-2009), a decarbonisation rate of about 1% has been seen globally"
4634,UNEP-2010-1.txt," However, it is important to note that expectations about feasibility can change with future developments in technology, attitudes, and economics"
4635,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
One of many important elements related to the feasibility of emission pathways is negative emissions"
4636,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Many of the scenarios compiled in this assessment show global negative carbon dioxide (C02) emissions (from energy and industry) from midcentury onwards in order to achieve the temperature limits examined here
4637,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
Global negative C02 emissions would occur if the removal of C02 from the atmosphere is greater than the emissions into it"
4638,UNEP-2010-1.txt," This might be achievable through large-scale afforestation efforts, for example"
4639,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Many models assume a large deployment of bioenergy combined with carbon-capture-and-storage (BECCS) technology in order to achieve negative emissions
4640,UNEP-2010-1.txt," The feasibility of large scale bioenergy systems is related to its sustainability, including the availability of sufficient land and water, its impact on biodiversity, and the productivity of biomass"

4687,UNEP-2010-1.txt," If the aim is to have a ""likely"" chance (greater than 66 per cent) of staying below the 2° C temperature limit, the gap would range from 5-9 GtC02e, depending on how the pledges are implemented"

As a reference point, we saw in Point 2 that to have a ""likely"" chance of staying below the 2° C temperature limit, global emissions should be around 44 GtC02e (range: 39-44 GtC02e)"

The four pledge cases, each with different assumptions about the future outcome of the UNFCCC negotiations, result in different gaps as follows:
Case 1 - ""Unconditional pledges, lenient rules"""

4706,UNEP-2010-1.txt, There are considerable uncertainties around the estimates of the gap

Since the emissions gap is the difference between emission levels for different temperature targets and expected emissions in 2020, the gap also inherits the uncertainties of these two components"
4708,UNEP-2010-1.txt," The reader will note that the range around median estimates (Figure C) is not symmetric; the lower bound extends about 1-2 GtC02e below the median, whereas the upper bound rises 7-9 GtC02e above it (for a ""likely"" chance of staying below 2°C)"
4709,UNEP-2010-1.txt, One way to interpret this skewed range is that the gap may turn out to be higher rather than lower than the median

b) Reducing the gap by tightening the rules"

4724,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
— Surplus emission units: Likewise, if the rules governing the use of surplus emission units under the Kyoto Protocol were designed in a way that would avoid the weakening of mitigation targets, the gap could be reduced by up to 2"

To have a ""medium"" rather than a /likely"" chance of staying below 2° C, the emission levels for the pledge cases can be about 1 GtC02e higher, and the corresponding gap 1 GtC02e lower for all pledge cases (Table 2)"
5146,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
Explanation of the range of results of the emissions gap for 2° C
The range of the gap presented for the different cases in Table 2 is based on the ""majority of results"" (20th to 80th percentile) across both the pledges and the 2° C emission levels"
5147,UNEP-2010-1.txt, The upper bound estimate of the gap combines low 2° C emission levels (20th percentile) with high emissions from pledges (80th percentile)
5148,UNEP-2010-1.txt," As explained in Chapter 2, emission levels consistent with the 2° C limit tend to be lower in 2020 when followed by comparatively slower emission reduction rates thereafter, or when negative emissions are not achieved over the long run"
5149,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"

Conversely, at the low end of the gap range we find a combination of higher 2° C emission levels in 2020 and low expected emissions as a result of the pledges"
5150,UNEP-2010-1.txt, Emission levels that are consistent with 2° C tend to be higher in 2020 when reduction rates are comparatively high after 2020 (3
5151,UNEP-2010-1.txt,1 per cent per year) and/or it is assumed that negative emissions take effect over the long run
5152,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Under these conditions, emissions can afford to be higher in 2020, since they will be reduced more quickly afterwards"
5153,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
The size of the gap is therefore strongly dependent on expectations about emission reduction rates after 2020 and the prospects for negative emissions later in the century"
5154,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Both depend, of course, on the rate of technological development"
5155,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
In addition, the reader will note that the range around median estimates is not symmetric; the lower bound extends by about 1-2 GtC02e below the median, whereas the upper bound rises 7-9 GtC02e above it (for a ""likely"" chance)"
5156,UNEP-2010-1.txt, This is found for all the pledge cases examined and arises because of the skewed distribution of pledge estimates with a more pronounced tail on the upper bound
5157,UNEP-2010-1.txt, One interpretation of this skewed range is that the gap may in reality tend to be on the higher side of the median
5158,UNEP-2010-1.txt,"
This chapter has so far focused on the ""majority of results"" (20th to 80th percentile of estimates)"
5159,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Results outside this range indicate that emission levels for a ""likely"" chance of staying below 2° C could be as high as 48 GtC02e (Chapter 2), while at the same time expected emissions under case 4 (""conditional pledges, strict rules"") could, according to one estimate, be as low as 45 GtC02e in 2020"
5160,UNEP-2010-1.txt," Under these conditions, no gap exists"
5161,UNEP-2010-1.txt," On the other hand, looking at the other end of the range, we find 2° C emission levels for a ""likely"" chance of staying below the 2° C limit can range as low as 26 GtC02e, while the highest estimate of emissions under case 1 of the pledge cases (""unconditional pledges, lenient rules"") is 61 GtC02e, resulting in a gap as high as 35 GtC02e"

Due to the very large uncertainties of the scientific projections of climate change, it is important that any analysis provide information on the ""tails"" or extremes of any probability distribution of future climates"

Climate change impacts that will require adaptation include (a) increased incidence of extreme weather events, which will draw resources away from development initiatives; (b) increased incidence of infectious and diarrheal diseases, which will reverse development gains in health standards; (c) changes in temperature and precipitation, which will affect agricultural productivity, making investments in this sector less productive: and (d) sea-level rise, which will lead to loss of lives and assets"

5255,WB-2010-4.txt, We clearly have no shortage of evidence to indicate that climate models have the capability to simulate continental-scale coherent patterns of temperature-and to a lesser degree precipitation-and anomalies associated with large-scale climate phenomenon such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation
5256,WB-2010-4.txt," However, key uncertainties-that is, disagreements with observations among climate models-still exist regarding the precise location, timing, and/or magnitude of temporal climate variations"
5257,WB-2010-4.txt, One only needs to look at global precipitation patterns to recognize these quantifiable deficiencies in climate models
5258,WB-2010-4.txt," Among the most prominent shortcomings of most climate models (Figure 4 shows the mean of the IPCC AR4 climate models) is the notable split in maximum precipitation in the eastern tropical Pacific^ and to a lesser extent, in the western tropical Atlantic basin"
5259,WB-2010-4.txt," In addition, the location and magnitude of the Indo-Asian Monsoon, as well as the South American rain-forest maximum precipitation as given by the model mean, disagree with observations"
5260,WB-2010-4.txt,The model- mean results shown here also average out considerably larger differences in regional patterns (especially in the tropical regions) from individual models
5261,WB-2010-4.txt, These larger differences among the individual models (Figure 5) stem largely from assumption about atmospheric and ocean physics made by the model building team
5262,WB-2010-4.txt, Embedded within all these processes is also the ability of any given climate model to faithfully represent the diurnal cycle of these mechanisms
5263,WB-2010-4.txt,"


This is of critics! importance for convective precipitation processes"
5264,WB-2010-4.txt," At present all climate models show considerable deficiencies in representing the observed night-time maximum precipitation (most models release too much precipitation far too early, with a maximum occurring in the late afternoon)"
5265,WB-2010-4.txt," Nevertheless, we can be confident that the fundamental physics explicitly represented in climate models is sound, and the information they give us-as a whole or as a continuum of plausible outcomes-is useful"
5266,WB-2010-4.txt, We must consider all their projections in the context of assessing potential impacts on and responses from our natural and managed systems
5267,WB-2010-4.txt,"

Evaluation of heating for Climate Change Projections When considering the ability of climate models to accurately reproduce observed climate trends and anomalies, and how these results may then be confidently applied to projected (and potential) changes in climate over the next century, we can draw some insight and guidance from the following passage in chapter 3 of the IPCC 4*^ Assessment Report:
""What does the accuracy of a climate model's simulation of past or contemporary climate say about the accuracy of its projections of climate change? This question is just beginning to be addressed"
5268,WB-2010-4.txt," studies show promise that quantitative metrics for the likelihood of model projections may be developed, but"
5269,WB-2010-4.txt, the development of robust metrics is still at an early stage
5270,WB-2010-4.txt,"""
As these remarks suggest, we cannot make a direct inference that because climate models can reproduce large-scale observed climatologies and accurately predict (or reproduce) climate anomalies , we should then have complete confidence in any one climate model or even a collection of climate models"
5271,WB-2010-4.txt, This even holds for models that have been run at an exceptionally high level of spatial detail (such as the MIROC-Hires)
5272,WB-2010-4.txt," Experience in climate evaluation, particularly in the area of hydro- logic variables, indicates that there is no ""best model"" and we must consider every model simulation individually"
5273,WB-2010-4.txt," A simple example of this with respect to simulated climate change can be seen in the projected changes in precipitation, evaporation, runoff, and soil moisture shown in Figure 6"
5274,WB-2010-4.txt," In the top set of panels, we see that the MIROC-Hires model would indicate a dramatic decrease in precipitation over much of the southern United States (extending north in the middle section of U"
5275,WB-2010-4.txt,"), which would pose a significant concern for water resource impacts"
5276,WB-2010-4.txt," However, looking at the same result from the CCSM3 model, there is a complete reversal in the sign of the precipitation response over much of the southern U"
5277,WB-2010-4.txt, (as well as the middle U
5278,WB-2010-4.txt, The only area of consistency in sign to the MIROC-Hires result is in the southwestern U
5279,WB-2010-4.txt,", but the CCSM precipitation decrease is considerably reduced"
5280,WB-2010-4.txt," A similar situation can be seen for parts of Africa (MIROC showing large decreases, CCMS showing increases over much of Africa)"
5281,WB-2010-4.txt," Similarly, the changes in runoff (which can be regarded as the ""available surface water"") show similar marked discrepancies"
5282,WB-2010-4.txt,"
This simple example in the mean annual fields of the major hydrologic variables raises an important issue regarding impact and response assessments for water resources"
5283,WB-2010-4.txt," If annual mean fields of changes show marked differences in sign and magnitude among climate models, the model average of these changes, not only at annual scales but also down to subdiurnal scales, is not an adequate input for impact, response, and adaptation assessments"
5284,WB-2010-4.txt," To date, many studies have used the model mean as inputs, but it is important to move away from this practice, simply because a model ""average"" of near zero is not necessarily the result of a combination of models predicting a near-zero change, but could also be a result of two opposing changes that differ in sign (as seen in Figure 6)"
5285,WB-2010-4.txt," This could result in a substantial risk and/or consequence, and the abatement of the risk-no matter how slight the chance of climate change might be-may be worthwhile to consider for policy and/or mitigation strategies"
5286,WB-2010-4.txt,"
We must therefore consider all possible outcomes that are being produced by climate models, and feed these changes individually through impact assessment models, which may also provide a critical coupled feedback to the climate models via land-use change or water fluxes"
5287,WB-2010-4.txt," While the potential exists for the range of simulated climate-change projections to vary so much among one another that they could be construed as ""noise,"" there is evidence to suggest that even when considering the collection of model outcomes, we see a consistency in some of the more salient changes"
5288,WB-2010-4.txt," As an example, the trend in precipitation interval as simulated by the IPCC AR4 models show-statistically and/or probabilistically speaking-agreement in their projection of the change in precipitation interval across latitudes as the climate warms (Figures 7a, 7b)"
5289,WB-2010-4.txt,"
What this implies is that although we cannot tie ourselves to one particular model outcome, we can have some confidence that we are not merely looking at ""noise,"" and there are regions where a sign change is consistent among the climate models-but with a range that is important to explicitly consider for assessment of potential impacts and adaptation"
5290,WB-2010-4.txt,"
While an approach that explicitly considers the range of possible climate-change outcomes as projected by global climate models is desirable, it is important to carefully consider whether there are some projections that should be filtered out as nearly implausible or at the very least, extremely unlikely"
5291,WB-2010-4.txt," This is a difficult task, as there is no clear metric with appropriate or sufficient data that can identify whether a given climate change projection can or should be excluded, particularly when considering a specific region of interest"
5292,WB-2010-4.txt," Further, if there is any chance that any given climate change simulation can occur, it should be considered within the spectrum of potential impact and/or adaptation-particularly if the risk of catastrophic damages and/or consequences is high"
5293,WB-2010-4.txt," Therefore, it may be a worthwhile effort at the outset of any risk/impact assessment to consider all climate model projections (at very little computational cost), and that the exclusion of certain climate change scenarios might be considered if the costs and/or damage of its associated impacts were very low"
5294,WB-2010-4.txt," It may also highlight outcomes that are beneficial, and these also are important in providing a comprehensive assessment of climate impacts and risks"
5295,WB-2010-4.txt," Overall, the method of using model-mean as inputs to impact and risk assessments should be replaced with the usage of the full spectrum of results, as the ""tails"" of the full spectrum of model projections may contain the riskiest aspects of climate change"
5296,WB-2010-4.txt,"
Criteria for Selection of Climate Change Projections Given this context and the EACC study objective to help decision makers in developing countries to better understand and assess the risks posed by climate change, the team agreed to select two G CM scenarios that represented the extremes of climate change impacts on the globe"
5297,WB-2010-4.txt, This section describes the criteria that should be used to evaluate climate change impacts
5298,WB-2010-4.txt,"
The key economic sectors being evaluated in the EACC include agriculture, water resources, infrastructure, ecosystems, and health"
5299,WB-2010-4.txt, All sectors are heavily influenced by soil moisture
5300,WB-2010-4.txt," Therefore the Climate Moisture Index (CMI), which is an indicator of the aridity of a region, was selected as an indicator to measure climate change impacts that would best represent impacts on the key sectors"
5301,WB-2010-4.txt, The CMI depends on average annual precipitation and average annual potential évapotranspiration (PET)
5302,WB-2010-4.txt,"1 If PET is greater than precipitation, the climate is considered to be dry, whereas if precipitation is greater than PET, the climate is moist"
5303,WB-2010-4.txt," Calculated as CMI = (P/PET)-1 {when PET>P} and CMI = 1-(PET/P) {when P>PET}, a CMI of-1 is very arid and a CMI of +1 is very humid"
5304,WB-2010-4.txt," As a ratio of two depth measurements, CMI is dimensionless"
5305,WB-2010-4.txt, The CMI can be evaluated at each of the 67420 grid cells of the CRU database (Figure 8)
5306,WB-2010-4.txt,"
It is a straightforward calculation to determine the CMI for each of the 56 GCMs"
5307,WB-2010-4.txt," For the EACC, it was decided to use the average changes in monthly precipitation and temperature for the years 2046 to 2055 for each GCM"
5308,WB-2010-4.txt, These average monthly changes were applied to the CRU 1961-90 average monthly temperature and precipitation to determine a CMI for each CGM
5309,WB-2010-4.txt, The CMI can be averaged over any spatial region
5310,WB-2010-4.txt, It was decided to select the two GCMs that represented the wet and dry GCM in 2050 over the land mass of the globe
5311,WB-2010-4.txt," Wet is defined as the GCM that had the largest increase in average CMI over the 1961- 90 CMI over the globe, while dry was defined as the CGM that had the largest decrease in average CMI over the 1961-90 CMI over the globe"
5312,WB-2010-4.txt,"
The reason the globe was selected rather than just over developing countries is that for the agricultural sector analysis, global food trade is a key element"
5313,WB-2010-4.txt," Climate change impacts on agriculture in the developed world is a very important part of any analysis of climate change impacts on food, agriculture, and hunger in the developing world"
5314,WB-2010-4.txt,"
Figure 9 shows the range of CMI for all scenarios for the globe and World Bank Regions as a whole and the remaining land mass"
5315,WB-2010-4.txt, Figure 10 show the CMI for all scenarios individually for each World Bank region
5316,WB-2010-4.txt, The red line represents the median CMI
5317,WB-2010-4.txt," The top of the box represents the 25^ percentile, while the bottom of the box represents the 75^ percentile"
5318,WB-2010-4.txt, The whiskers show the extremes and the cross-hairs show the model outliers
5319,WB-2010-4.txt, The dashed lines represent the historical CMI (averaged from 1960-90)
5320,WB-2010-4.txt," For example, in the LCR region, there is a 75 percent chance of drying with all three scenarios"
5321,WB-2010-4.txt, The CMI for the SAR region has the largest spread because of the way the different GCMs model the monsoons
5322,WB-2010-4.txt," In the MNA region, there is not much variation because the area is so dry"
5323,WB-2010-4.txt,"

It is important to note that the CMI is only calculated over land masses and not over the ocean"
5324,WB-2010-4.txt," Many climate change analyses discuss GCMs with regard to their properties results over land and sea, but for hydrology and water resources impacts all that matters is what is occurring over the land"
5325,WB-2010-4.txt, One may notice that all the CMI in the box and whiskers plots are negative
5326,WB-2010-4.txt," These results show that warming leading to increases in potential évapotranspiration dominates over increased precipitation over the globe's land mass, leading to an increase in aridity or a drying for more than 75 percent of all GCMs"
5327,WB-2010-4.txt,"

Selection of Climate Change Projections Figures 9 and 10 show that the 56 GCMs provide for a large range of CMI for the globe, developing countries, and each individual World Bank region"
5328,WB-2010-4.txt," However, for reasons related to socioeconomic baseline consistency, the EACC team decided to limit GCM scenarios to those run for the A2 $RE$ scenario"
5329,WB-2010-4.txt, This reduced the possible number of GCMs to 17
5330,WB-2010-4.txt,"
A further constraint was placed on the suite of candidate GCMs"
5331,WB-2010-4.txt, The agricultural sector required that the GCM selected must provide monthly Tmin and Tmax to the AR4 archive
5332,WB-2010-4.txt, This limited the number of SRE$ A-2 to six that met all constraints
5333,WB-2010-4.txt,"




Based on the global CMI analysis, the CSIRO IVlK_3_0 was selected as the EACC dry climate scenario and NCAR_CCSM was selected as the wet

5335,WB-2010-4.txt,"
Figures 13 and 14 are plots of the annual maximum temperature changes in 2050 for the dr)' and wet scenarios, respectively temperature, calculated modified Penman-Ivlonteith potential évapotranspiration (PET), and calculated Civil for 2030 and 2050"
5336,WB-2010-4.txt," Annual results are in Appendix A, seasonal results are in Appendix B, and monthly results are in Appendix C"
5337,WB-2010-4.txt," USE OF CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS
The spatial and temporal scale of impact and adaptation analyses needed for the EACC sectoral analyses span a wide range from very small (1-10 km^ and daily to weekly) for local village water supply to very large catchments (100,000 km^ and monthly to yearly) for major reservoirs"

5340,WB-2010-4.txt," One potential difficulty with using climate information in impact assessments is the mis-match between the low spatial (and temporal) resolution of GCMs, on the one hand, and the scale at which assessments need typically to be conducted, on the other"
5341,WB-2010-4.txt, GCMs provide climate change projections at a low spatial resolution (-2

There are several methods available for addressing scale issues, including statistical downscaling (using empirical relationships), dynamical downscaling (using regional climate models), and spatial techniques2 (linear interpolation, krigging, spline fitting, and intelligent interpolation)"
5346,WB-2010-4.txt, Downscaling involves methods used to map the large-scale signals from GCMs to a finer resolution (tens of kilometers versus hundreds of kilometers)
5347,WB-2010-4.txt,"
Care needs to be taken in selecting a method"
5348,WB-2010-4.txt," Beyond reproducing the underlying uncertainties of GCMs, many introduce additional uncertainty and biases"
5349,WB-2010-4.txt," For example, downscaling techniques increase the detail of information, but also the uncertainties associated with that information since the GCM output is manipulated below the scale at which the physics of the GCM itself are mathematically described"
5350,WB-2010-4.txt," Under some downscaling schemes, mass balances of water and energy over the GCM scale are violated by the downscaling algorithm"
5351,WB-2010-4.txt," Use of dynamic and statistical downscaling techniques requires extensive quantification of the sensitivities of the underlying assumptions of both the GCMs and the downscaling algorithms, resulting in the need for exhaustive numerical experimentation"
5352,WB-2010-4.txt, Time and cost constraints often do not allow use of more than a couple of GCMs in downscaling exercises
5353,WB-2010-4.txt," Running multiple GCMs at a coarse resolution may provide more insight into the range of possible futures than more detailed information obtained from fewer GCMs
There is no one ""best"" method; the most appropriate method for a particular application will strike a careful balance between precision (resolution) and accuracy (confidence in projections)"
5354,WB-2010-4.txt, Figure 15 provides a visual representation of the trade-off between precision and accuracy
5355,WB-2010-4.txt," As resolution increases, so too does the uncertainty associated with the more detailed information"
5356,WB-2010-4.txt," In other words, more ""precise"" information comes at a cost, and the additional uncertainty must be recognized and taken into account in assessing impacts"
5357,WB-2010-4.txt," Given the trade-off, it is critical to establish at the outset of any impact assessment whether the goal is to have finer resolution or ""better""-that is, more reliable-information"
5358,WB-2010-4.txt,"
Sub-GCM Grid Scale Climate Change Projections For this work the spatial resolution for the use of GCM was at the native grid scale of each GCM"
5359,WB-2010-4.txt, The GCM provided relative changes in temperature and precipitation for the years 2030 (average over 2026 to 2035) and 2050 (average over 2046 to 2055) on a monthly level as compared to the model baseline (1961-90) of the 20th century
5360,WB-2010-4.txt, These relative changes were then applied directly to the historic climate variables from the CRU data set
5361,WB-2010-4.txt," As seen in Figure 15, there are numerous half degree by half degree CRU grids within each GCM grid box"
5362,WB-2010-4.txt," For this analysis, we apply the relative changes from the GCM grid box uniformly to all CRU grid cells within the GCM grid box"
5363,WB-2010-4.txt," While this leads to some discontinuities at the border of grid boxes, it is the most appropriate technique for this work given the scope and mathematics of the GCM models"
5364,WB-2010-4.txt,"
With the uncertainty inherent in the GCM and the CRU data, it would be unwise to perform this analysis at the lowest level of resolution; half degree by half degree"
5365,WB-2010-4.txt, Aggregating to a higher spatial level would reduce the uncertainty in the model indicators and more correctly reflect the larger scale climate change projections from the GCM models
5366,WB-2010-4.txt," For the agricultural sector analysis, a large-scale food producing unit (FPU) is the unit of analysis; for the water resources analysis, a catchment scale (refer to Figure 15) is used; and for infrastructure and health, a national-scale analysis is used"

WMO statement on the status of the global climate in 2008



Foreword



In 1873 the First International Meteorological Congress assembled in Vienna to establish the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which by 1929 had launched its Commission for Climatology, During August 1947, the ten IMO technical commissions and its six regional commissions held their respective sessions simultaneously in Toronto, Canada"
5371,WMO-2009-3.txt," These meetings immediately preceded the Washington (Eighth) Conference of Directors of Meteorological Services, which in October 1947 unanimously approved the Convention of a new organization: the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)"
5372,WMO-2009-3.txt," Following the necessary ratifications, WMO took over the IMO responsibilities on 23 March 1950 and, one year later, WMO became a specialized agency of the United Nations system"
5373,WMO-2009-3.txt,"
Fifty years after the founding of the IMO Commission for Climatology, in 1979 WMO organized the First World Climate Conference, in collaboration with the International Council for Science, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations"
5374,WMO-2009-3.txt," This historic conference led to the establishment of the WMO World Climate Programme and, in 1980, to the World Climate Research Programme, which WMO first co-sponsored with the International Council for Science and subsequently also with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, Furthermore, the conference paved the way for the 1988establishment of the WMO/UNEP co-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which received the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for its efforts ""to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change"""
5375,WMO-2009-3.txt,"
The Second World Climate Conference, which WMO organized with partners in 1990, provided decisive momentum to the international efforts that resulted in the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Global Climate Observing System, In the wake of these historic events, WMO began to issue in 1993 its annual report ""WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate"", which by now has become a well-established source of authoritative information, eagerly sought after every year by the scientific community and the media"
5376,WMO-2009-3.txt, The WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2008 is the latest in this successful series
5377,WMO-2009-3.txt,"
The year 2008 was notable, in particular, as it signalled positive global temperature anomalies, which positioned it among the ten warmest on record since the beginning of modern measurements in 1850, Several extreme weather and climate events were recorded in various parts of the world in 2008, of which perhaps the most dramatic was tropical cyclone Nargis, which made landfall in Myanmar in May, causing catastrophic destruction and more than 70 000 fatalities"
5378,WMO-2009-3.txt," Other parts of the world suffered severe flooding, extreme heat waves and droughts in 2008, while Arctic sea ice was once more observed to decline markedly, reaching during September its second-lowest historic extent,
I would like to highlight that 2008 was the second year of the International Polar Year 2007-2008, a WMO co-sponsored scientific venture that has already made decisive contributions to our scientific understanding of climate in the polar regions"
5379,WMO-2009-3.txt,"
I wish to express the appreciation of WMO to all the Centre sand the National Meteorological and Hydrologicai Services of WMO Members that collaborated with WMO and contributed to the present publication"

5395,WMO-2009-3.txt,"
The global average temperature in 2008 was slightly lower than for the previous years of the twenty-first century, owing in part to the moderate-to-strong La Niña that devel- oped in the latter half of 2007"

All temperature values have uncertainties, which arise mainly from gaps in data coverage"

Ten years ago, the Inuit people asked the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to hear their claim that the unchecked effects of climate change were violating their human rights"
8276,UNEP-2015-7.txt," At the time, the request seemed quixotic, especially after the Commission declined to hear the case"
8277,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In retrospect, however, the Inuit petition was the first harbinger of a sea-change in how the international community thinks about climate change"
8278,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In 2007, a group of small island states came together to adopt the Male' Declaration, the first intergovernmental statement that ""climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights"
8279,UNEP-2015-7.txt,""" The next year, they convinced the United Nations Human Rights Council to adopt the first of what became a series of resolutions linking climate change to a host of impacts on human rights"
8280,UNEP-2015-7.txt, The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights then issued a seminal report describing those effects
8281,UNEP-2015-7.txt," And in 2010, the State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Cancun that the ""Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights"
8282,UNEP-2015-7.txt,""" The relevance of human rights to climate change is now universally recognized"
8283,UNEP-2015-7.txt," On Human Rights Day last year, December 10, 2014, all 78 UN human rights mandate-holders came together to issue a joint statement underscoring the threat climate change poses to human rights, and unanimously calling on States ""to make sure that human rights are at the core of climate change governance"

8294,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The latest assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes how observed and predicted changes in climate will adversely affect billions of people and the ecosystems, natural resources, and physical infrastructure upon which they depend"
8295,UNEP-2015-7.txt," These harmful impacts include sudden-onset events that pose a direct threat to human lives and safety, as well as more gradual forms of environmental degradation that will undermine access to clean water, food, and other key resources that support human life"
8296,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
As a consequence, climate change will have a profound effect on the enjoyment of human rights for individuals and communities across the planet"

8300,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Further complicating the picture, measures undertaken to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to climate change can themselves adversely affect the enjoyment of human rights"

8307,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Part I describes the latest projections and observations of how climate change impacts and responses can affect the environment, individuals and communities"
8308,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Some of the key findings include:
· The impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, ecosystems, and human settlements are already undermining access to clean water, food, shelter, and other basic human needs; interfering with livelihoods; and displacing people from their homes"
8309,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Even if we remain within the international goal of 2° C of global warming, these impacts will expand dramatically in the coming decades"
8310,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· These impacts constitute a serious interference with the exercise of fundamental human rights, such as the rights to life, health, water, food, housing, and an adequate standard of living"
8311,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· Mitigation, adaptation, and geoengineering measures can also adversely affect the exercise of human rights"
8312,UNEP-2015-7.txt," For example, there are documented instances of hydroelectric and biofuel projects that have resulted in human rights violations"
8313,UNEP-2015-7.txt," There is also a high risk of human rights violations resulting from the implementation of resettlement programs for those who are displaced or at risk of displacement due to climate change, and a corresponding need to ensure that such programs are undertaken with adequate input and consent from those who are relocated"

8317,UNEP-2015-7.txt," These include:
· Procedural obligations for all governments to ensure that the affected public is: (i) adequately informed about the impacts of climate change and the measures undertaken to both mitigate and adapt to climate change; (ii) adequately involved in public decisions about climate change; and (iii) given access to administrative, judicial, and other remedies when rights are violated as a result of climate change and responses to it"
8318,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· Substantive obligations for all governments to: (i) protect human rights from climate-related harms; (ii) respond to the core drivers of climate change by regulating GHG emissions within their jurisdiction; (iii) cooperate internationally to protect human rights against climate-related harms; (iv) address the transboundary impacts of climate change; and (v) safeguard human rights in all mitigation and adaptation activities"
8319,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· States also have unique obligations with respect to certain groups, including women, children, and indigenous peoples"
8320,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Notably, states must obtain free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) before undertaking any measures that would adversely affect the traditional lands and resources of indigenous peoples"
8321,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· Private actors also have obligations to address the human rights implications of climate change, and should refer to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to ensure that they fully respect human rights in all activities"

Part III discusses the implementation of these obligations, focusing primarily on activities undertaken by national governments either within or outside of the UNFCCC context"
8323,UNEP-2015-7.txt," It documents several recent developments in this area:
· Some states are beginning to recognize the linkages between human rights and climate change in reports submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat, but this is not the case for the majority of developed nations"
8324,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· There is a significant ""emissions gap"" between the mitigation commitments set forth in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and the emission reductions required to keep warming at or below 2°C"
8325,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· There is also a significant ""adaptation finance gap"" in terms of what will be needed to adapt to climate change and the finance, technology and capacity available"
8326,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· Finally, there is a significant ""finance gap"" between the financial and technical assistance that has been given or pledged to developing countries and the resources that will be required to ensure that climate change does not interfere with the exercise of human rights in those countries"
8327,UNEP-2015-7.txt, This is true even if we do meet the 2°C target
8328,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"

8330,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Our key recommendations for the parties to the UNFCCC include:
· National parties should commit to more ambitious mitigation targets to ensure that the global average temperature increase remains at or below 2°C"
8331,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· The COP should recognize the link between climate change and human rights in the Paris Agreement"
8332,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· The safeguards for the various climate finance mechanisms should be made uniform and revised to ensure full respect for human rights"
8333,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· National parties should increase financial and technical assistance to developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, to protect human rights in those areas"
8334,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
· National parties should continue to discuss the issue of loss and damage in a transparent way that will address the concerns of all affected countries"

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
The natural environment provides human beings and the communities in which we live with the resources we need to achieve lives of dignity and well-being ­ clean air to breathe; clean water to drink; food to eat; fuels for energy; protection from storms, floods, fires and drought; climate regulation and disease control; and places to congregate for aesthetic, recreational and spiritual enjoyment"
8339,UNEP-2015-7.txt, These environmental endowments--often referred to as ecosystem services--are at once essential to core survival and vital to human flourishing
8340,UNEP-2015-7.txt," As the nations of the world declared in The Future We Want, the outcome document of the 2012 Rio+20 conference, sustainable development requires that we angle toward ""harmony with nature"
8341,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""1 To achieve this idea, we must balance economic, social and human development with ""ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges"
8342,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""The nature of the linkages between the environment and human rights has been debated for years"
8343,UNEP-2015-7.txt," However, it has long been recognized that a clean, healthy and functional environment is integral to the enjoyment of human rights, such as the rights to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living"
8344,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This recognition offers one reason the international community has banded together through multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) to prohibit illegal trade in wildlife, to preserve biodiversity and marine and terrestrial habitats, to reduce transboundary pollution, and to prevent other behaviors that harm the planet and its residents"
8345,UNEP-2015-7.txt, In short: Environmental protection protects human rights
8346,UNEP-2015-7.txt," At the same time, adherence to human rights--such as those that ensure public access to information and participation in decision making--contributes to more just decisions about the utilization and protection of environmental resources, and protects against the potential for abuse under the auspices of environmental action"
8347,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Thus, domestic environmental laws and MEAs can both be strengthened through the incorporation of human rights principles, even as they contribute to the ongoing realization of human rights"
8348,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Anthropogenic climate change is the largest, most pervasive threat to the natural environment and human rights of our time"
8349,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Climate change has already begun to have far-reaching environmental impacts, including many adverse effects on wildlife, natural resources and the ecological processes that support access to clean water, food, and other basic human needs"
8350,UNEP-2015-7.txt," These impacts, combined with direct harms to people, property, and physical infrastructure, pose a serious threat to the enjoyment and exercise of human rights across the world"
8351,UNEP-2015-7.txt,3 The mandate to take immediate action to both reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change and enact measures that reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to climate change impacts is clear
8352,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Yet, certain responses to climate change--including both mitigation and adaptation activities--can also interfere with human rights, as has been the case for a number of hydroelectric and biofuel projects undertaken, in part, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions"
8353,UNEP-2015-7.txt," It is critical that as the world endeavors to address the ""super wicked"" problem of climate change it do so with full respect for human rights"
8354,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Over the course of the last decade the international community has arrived at a clear consensus on all of these issues"
8355,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Yet, while United Nations agencies and national governments have explicitly acknowledged that climate change and responses to climate change can impair human rights, there has been less agreement on the corresponding obligations of governments and private actors to address this problem"
8356,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The purpose of this report is to inform the decisions undertaken by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at COP-21, as well as other activities undertaken by governments and private actors, by providing an up-to-date assessment of the relationship between climate change and human rights law and by making recommendations for incorporating a human rights lens into international and domestic climate action"

(a) Impacts on Ecosystems and Natural Resources
(i) Freshwater Resources
According to IPCC projections, climate change will significantly reduce surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, thus intensifying competition for water among agriculture, ecosystems, settlements, industry, and energy production, and affecting regional water, energy, and food security"
8388,UNEP-2015-7.txt,9 Climate change will also increase the frequency of droughts in presently dry areas
8389,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The primary drivers of these projected water shortages and droughts include: (i) reduced rainfall, (ii) reduced snowpack, resulting in less snowmelt supplying rivers and streams; (iii) higher temperatures, which increase evaporation from surface water and soils; and (iv) sea level rise, which contributes to saltwater inundation of freshwater resources"
8390,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In addition, variations in the timing, magnitude, and type of precipitation, as well as temperature increases and sea level rise, can harm freshwater ecosystems by changing stream flow and water quality"

8704,UNEP-2015-7.txt,", a duty to respect rights); and (ii) positive obligations for states to protect and fulfill rights"
8705,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"112 As noted by the UN General Assembly:
""Each state has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political, and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice"
8706,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""Based on these obligations, the CESCR, regional courts, and UN special rapporteurs have concluded that states have a general duty to ""adopt legal and institutional frameworks that protect against, and respond to, environmental harm that may or does interfere with the enjoyment of human rights"
8707,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""114 The framework must ensure that the state will respect human rights in all of its activities and decisions, and include protections to prevent third parties from creating environmental harms that interfere with the exercise of human rights"
8708,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"115 In addition, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has held that states must also take reasonable measures to protect citizens against the reasonably foreseeable effects of natural disasters"
8709,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"The adverse impacts of climate change clearly qualify as ""environmental harms"" that can interfere with the exercise of human rights"
8710,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Thus, states must enact legal and institutional frameworks to protect against and respond to those impacts"

8712,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
There are at least three overarching principles which apply to all of these obligations"
8713,UNEP-2015-7.txt," First, states are ""obliged to take measures towards the full realization of economic, social, and cultural rights to the maximum extent of their available resources"

8715,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""

Second, although international human rights law generally requires the ""progressive realization"" of economic, social, and cultural rights, there are some obligations which require immediate implementation"
8716,UNEP-2015-7.txt," For example, states must guarantee non-discrimination in access to economic, social and cultural rights, irrespective of resource constraints"
8717,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"119 States also have an immediate obligation to ensure, at the very least, ""minimum essential levels"" of each right that is enshrined in the ICESCR"
8718,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"120 In addition, states have an immediate obligation to refrain from undertaking actions that cause a violation of any human rights"
8719,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Third, states have an obligation to protect all rights against third party abuses"
8720,UNEP-2015-7.txt," As interpreted by the HR Committee, this means that states must ""take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress"" any human rights violations caused by third parties"
8721,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"(i) Adaptation Obligations: Protecting Human Rights From Climate-Related Harms
Article 6 of the ICCPR recognizes that ""[e]very human being has the inherent right to life"" and that no person ""shall be arbitrarily deprived of life"

8724,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"As discussed in Part 1, the effects of climate change will threaten the lives, health, well-being, and livelihoods of hundreds of millions if not billions of people in the coming decades"
8725,UNEP-2015-7.txt, States have an obligation to enact legal and institutional frameworks to protect human rights against these effects
8726,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This is true regardless of whether the state is responsible for those effects because, as noted above, the ICCPR and ICESCR both include obligations to protect human rights from harms caused by third parties"
8727,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Presumably, this would encompass a more pressing obligation to protect citizens from imminent, life-threatening harms (such as more severe storms and flooding), as well as an ongoing obligation to implement adaptation measures to alleviate the projected impacts of climate change on people and their livelihoods"
8728,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The ECtHR has issued several decisions which, although not binding under the ICCPR or ICESCR, do provide insight on the nature of a state's positive obligation to protect the human right to life in this context"

8918,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
While the failure to report on the linkages between human rights and climate change is not itself a violation of human rights obligations, it does suggest that many countries are not thinking about these obligations when formulating climate change plans and policies"

support human life220--indeed, based on the IPCC's analysis (summarized in Part 1), an increase of this magnitude will have environmental impacts that seriously interfere with human rights for millions and perhaps even billions of people across the world"
8924,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
In November 2015 UNEP published its sixth Emissions Gap Report which provides a scientific assessment of the mitigation contributions from submitted INDCs, and compares this with the mitigation levels required to meet the target of a global average temperature increase below 2°C by 2100"

8928,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"222 Therefore although the INDCs do present a real increase in the ambition level compared to a projection of current policies, there is still a large emissions gap in 2030 of 12GtCO2e (with a range of 10-15)"
8929,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"In light of these findings, there is a clear need to continue increasing ambition with respect to global GHG mitigation"
8930,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Thus, many countries have called for inclusion of a mechanism for gradually ""ratcheting down"" emissions (or ""ramping up ambition"") in the upcoming Paris agreement"
8931,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"224 Such a mechanism could contribute to mitigation ambition, although it may not go far enough to protect human rights from climate-related harms"

One of the most important developments occurred in 1992, when the UN General Assembly adopted the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development"
8971,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Principle 10 stated that:
Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level"

8974,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided"
8975,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"The outcome document for Rio+20, The Future We Want, reaffirmed that ""broad public participation and access to information and judicial and administrative proceedings are essential to the promotion of sustainable development"
8976,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""243 Countries across the world have taken important steps towards implementing these principles in environmental decision-making,244 and this seems to be the case for climate-related decisions as well"
8977,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
For example, it appears that many countries are making reasonable efforts to assess the impacts of climate change, as well as the contribution of their activities to climate change, and make this information available to the public"
8978,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This includes efforts to: (1) monitor and disclose domestic sources of GHG emissions, in accordance with Annex I of the UNFCCC; (2) inform the public about the potential impacts and risks associated with climate change; 245 (3) describe and evaluate efforts to respond to climate change;246 and (4) use existing EIA procedures to inform decision-makers and the public about the contribution of a proposed action to global GHG emissions, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on those proposals"
8979,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"It is difficult to gauge the extent to which governments are promoting public participation in decisions that involve climate change, for instance major projects that generate GHG emissions or the development of local, regional and national adaptation plans"
8980,UNEP-2015-7.txt," National progress in this context relates to the broader issue of public participation in local, regional and national governance, and accordingly with general implementation of the rule of law in nations around the world"

8985,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"Finally, perhaps the largest procedural gap in this context is the lack of access to justice and remedies for climaterelated harms"
8986,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In both domestic courts and international tribunals, many cases alleging serious injury to human rights caused by the effects of climate change have been dismissed or have failed due to: (i) the challenge of establishing a causal link between specific emitters and climate change; (ii) the challenge of establishing a causal link between climate change and the on-the-ground impacts that gave rise to the harm; and/or (iii) the absence of legal requirements or liability for GHG emissions"
8987,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"251 Jurisdiction (or lack thereof) also poses a major barrier to judicial remedies, especially in the context of transboundary harms"
8988,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Moreover, there is no international grievance mechanism that would provide an alternative forum for justice and remedies in this context--although many developing countries would like to see a Loss and Damage Framework developed under the auspices of the UNFCCC that could fill this role"
8989,UNEP-2015-7.txt,One way for countries to implement and further elaborate upon their procedural human rights obligations is through participation in MEAs

(c) Green Climate Fund
In 2014, the GCF Board decided to adopt, on an interim basis, the International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) environmental and social performance standards for GCF-funded projects"
9028,UNEP-2015-7.txt,273 The IFC safeguards include eight performance standards addressing the following issues: (i) Assessment and management of social and environmental risks and impacts; (ii) Labor and working conditions; (iii) Resource efficiency and pollution prevention; (iv) Community health; (v) Safety and security; (vi) Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement; (vii) Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources; (viii) Full respect of rights of indigenous people and protection of cultural heritage
9029,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The Board also adopted terms of reference for an ""Independent Redress Mechanism"" to receive complaints related to the operation of the Fund and make operation"
9030,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"274 Once operational, peoples and communities who are directly affected by adverse impacts of projects resulting from a failure to implement the IFC safeguards can submit a complaint to the mechanism"

The IFC standards appear to provide adequate protection for human rights--for example, they specify that, in the context of land acquisition projects, project proponents should ""avoid/minimize displacement,"" ""avoid forced eviction,"" and ""improve or restore livelihoods and standards of living"
9033,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""275 They also require FPIC for indigenous peoples under specified circumstances"
9034,UNEP-2015-7.txt,276 These substantive provisions are complemented by the procedural mechanisms noted above

(d) Adaptation Fund
The Adaptation Fund Board approved an Environmental and Social Policy in November 2013"
9037,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"277 The policy outlines a process for screening projects and programs based on their environmental and social impacts, and adopting measures to mitigate any adverse impacts"
9038,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Specifically, the policy requires implementing entities to adopt measures to avoid or, where avoidance is impossible, minimize environmental and social risks, and monitor and report on the status of those measures during and at the end of implementation"
9039,UNEP-2015-7.txt," It also outlines a set of social principles to guide the impact assessment process, which are more comprehensive than some of the other safeguard policies"
9040,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Some notable aspects of these principles include:
· They explicitly require that all projects supported by the Fund ""respect and where applicable promote human rights,""278 and furthermore, that all projects adhere to ""core labour standards as identified
by the International Labour Organization""279 and the ""rights and responsibilities set forth in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other applicable international instruments relating to indigenous peoples"
9041,UNEP-2015-7.txt,""" · They require that projects be designed and implemented in a way that ""avoids or minimizes the need for involuntary resettlement"" and specify requirements for when ""limited involuntary settlement is unavoidable"" which include ""socially feasible resettlement alternatives or fair and adequate compensation"
9042,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""
· They require that all supported projects ""provide fair and equitable access to benefits in a manner that is inclusive and does not impede access to basic health services, clean water and sanitation, energy, education, housing, safe and decent working conditions, and land rights,"" and that projects ""should not exacerbate existing inequities, particularly with respect to marginalized or vulnerable groups"
9043,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"""281 They also include specific provisions to ensure that project proponents respect the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups and women"
9044,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"· They include provisions for habitat protection, conservation of biological diversity, pollution prevention, resource efficiency, public health, physical and cultural heritage, and land and soil conservation"
9045,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"The policy also includes relatively robust requirements for public disclosure and consultation, and for monitoring, reporting, and evaluating the implementation of projects and risk mitigation measures"
9046,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"284 Finally the policy requires that the implementing entities identify a grievance mechanism that will provide affected persons with an ""accessible, transparent, fair and effective process for receiving and addressing their complaints about environmental or social harms"" caused by the project, and also allows for complaints to be submitted to the Adaptation Fund Board secretariat"
9047,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"Thus, like the Green Climate Fund, these safeguards appear to be sufficient for the protection and promotion of both substantive and procedural human rights"

Recommendations
Based on the following summary of human rights obligations and implementation, this report makes the following recommendations on how the UNFCCC Parties and other actors can better integrate human rights considerations into their mitigation and adaptation activities"
9059,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"1 International Cooperation
More Ambitious Mitigation Targets ­ Even if all of the INDCs are fully implemented, the anticipated level of global warming will result in extreme climatic and environmental impacts and widespread adverse effects on human rights"
9060,UNEP-2015-7.txt, The Parties should continue to increase their mitigation ambition so as to ensure that the global average temperature increase remains at or below 2
9061,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"0°C, and preferably 1"
9062,UNEP-2015-7.txt," To this end, the Paris agreement should include a schedule for assessing and revisiting country commitments with the aim of increasing, over time, the ambition of the climate targets set by countries"
9063,UNEP-2015-7.txt, Another way to encourage more ambition would be to establish scientifically-based targets for all countries and then assess the performance of countries with respect to these targets
9064,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The targets could account for countries' historical and current GHG emissions (on a countrywide, per capita, and per unit of GDP basis) as well as the financial and technical capacity of the country to make emissions reductions"
9065,UNEP-2015-7.txt, Nations should also undertake efforts to reduce emissions above and beyond their international commitments
9066,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Recognize the Link Between Climate Change and Human Rights in the Paris Agreement: The COP should expressly refer to both the effects of climate change on the exercise of human rights and the need for Parties to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill human rights in all climate-related activities"
9067,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This could include: (i) recognizing the human rights-climate change nexus in the preamble to the agreement; (ii) noting that one purpose of the agreement is to protect, respect, and fulfill the human rights of all persons; (iii) calling for mitigation commitments that are sufficient to fully protect human rights; (iv) calling upon the parties to ensure that all mitigation and adaptation activities do not violate human rights; and (v) incorporating more robust human rights safeguards into climate finance mechanisms"
9068,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"


RECOMMENDATIONS

Human Rights Safeguards for International Climate Finance Mechanisms ­ The safeguards for the various climate funds and other mechanisms used to finance mitigation and adaptation projects should be made uniform and revised to fully account for human rights considerations"
9069,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The Adaptation Fund policy provides a good model, although it would be useful to flesh out many of the provisions in that policy with more detailed guidance"

9071,UNEP-2015-7.txt,", ""no harm"" rules to ensure that projects do not adversely affect local communities"
9072,UNEP-2015-7.txt," One way to achieve this would be to establish a social and environmental safeguard policy that applies to all UNFCCC mechanisms and funds, accompanied by a more detailed implementation guide"
9073,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Financial Assistance to Developing Countries ­ It is imperative that developed countries increase financial assistance to developing countries, and in particular, the LDCs and countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change"
9074,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In particular, the amount of funding available for adaptation measures in these countries should be significantly increased in order to account for the disproportionate adverse effects of climate change on people, settlements, and ecosystems"
9075,UNEP-2015-7.txt," The $100 billion goal should not be viewed as an overarching goal for all climate finance in developed countries, as it is inadequate even to cover the cost of mitigation measures (let alone adaptation measures)"
9076,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Rather, separate funding targets should be established for adaptation measures"
9077,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Climate Displacement and Migration ­ Climate change could contribute to the temporary displacement and permanent migration of millions of people in the coming decades"
9078,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Countries should cooperate in the development of an international mechanism for addressing climate-induced displacement and migration, both within and across domestic borders"
9079,UNEP-2015-7.txt," Proposals have already been made for the creation of ""Climate Change Displacement Coordination Facility"" within the UNFCCC, and countries should consider supporting the development of such a facility"
9080,UNEP-2015-7.txt,Loss and Damage ­ Countries should also continue to discuss the broader issue of loss and damage in a transparent way that will address the concerns of all affected countries
9081,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This could occur within the framework of the existing Warsaw Mechanism, or a new platform could be developed (most likely within the UNFCCC)"
9082,UNEP-2015-7.txt, Additional stakeholders--such as the UN human rights agencies and expert bodies--could be included in this dialogue

Continued Focus on Environmental Protection and Conservation ­ A continued focus on environmental protection and conservation will be necessary to address the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources"
9091,UNEP-2015-7.txt," As such, governmental and private actors should remain dedicated to these goals--for example, through the ongoing and enhanced implementation of MEAs, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity"
9092,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"2 National Measures
National Mitigation ­ Regardless of what happens within the UNFCCC, countries should continue to pursue domestic GHG reductions to the greatest extent practicable and with a target of achieving a net zero carbon economy, as this will be necessary to safeguard the human rights of persons both within and outside of their territory"
9093,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
National Adaptation Planning ­ Countries should consider how to align human rights and climate change adaptation objectives"
9094,UNEP-2015-7.txt," One approach would be to pursue an integrated response to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, in order to better safeguard human rights in the face of climate-related disasters"
9095,UNEP-2015-7.txt," National planners should also pursue adaptation measures with environmental and social co-benefits, such as ecosystem-based adaptation, which refers to the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of natural ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change"

National Adoption of Human Rights Protections ­ Countries should incorporate human rights norms into their domestic legal frameworks, including (but not limited to) laws that specifically address climate change"
9099,UNEP-2015-7.txt," This could include, for example, specific provisions to ensure that the affected public has knowledge of and an adequate opportunity to comment on proposals for domestic mitigation and adaptation policies"
9100,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In developing domestic policies, countries can consult with existing MEAs, the Bali Guidelines Bali Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, and a Compilation of Good Practices published earlier this year by the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment,292 among other resources"
9101,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"3 Local Governments and Private Actors
Local Governments ­ Local governments should undertake measures to reduce GHG emissions within their jurisdiction and pursue adaptation objectives in a manner that is mindful of human rights"
9102,UNEP-2015-7.txt," As with national governments, local governments should ensure that adaptation responses are non-discriminatory, consider integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs, and pursue adaptation measures with environmental and social co-benefits, such as ecosystem-based adaptation"
9103,UNEP-2015-7.txt,"
Private Sector - Private actors also have important roles to play in addressing climate change and protecting human rights"
9104,UNEP-2015-7.txt," They can place pressure on national governments to adopt more ambitious policies and cooperate in international negotiations, and can also undertake their own initiatives to reduce their carbon foot print and ensure that they respect human rights in all of their activities"
9105,UNEP-2015-7.txt," In particular, large businesses should adopt policies that correspond with the recommendations set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights"

Foreword

Following the historic signing of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, this sixth edition of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report comes as world leaders start gathering in Paris to establish a new agreement on climate change"
9265,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The report offers an independent assessment of the mitigation contributions from the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) committed to by 1 October 2015, by the 146 countries that account for around 90 per cent of global emissions"
9266,UNEP-2015-8.txt, It compares the 2030 emission levels that would result from these commitments with what science tells us would keep average temperature increases on track to stay below 2°C by the end of the century; it provides data for an aspirational target of keeping that increase below 1
9267,UNEP-2015-8.txt,5°C; and it evaluates the INDCs in relation to progress on the 2020 pledges made in Cancun
9268,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The INDCs demonstrate a significant increase in ambition and their successful delivery could reduce emissions by around 25 per cent compared to the level expected from current policies and pledges"
9269,UNEP-2015-8.txt," However, this would still put long-term temperatures on track for an increase and lead to serious climate impact, so more action is required"
9270,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"

With many new emission reduction initiatives also generating substantial economic, social and environmental benefits, the INDC preparation process in most countries encouraged greater exploration of the links between development and climate"
9271,UNEP-2015-8.txt, This is an important first step in a possible transition towards more low carbon economies
9272,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The Emissions Gap Report makes it very clear that while reaching a meaningful global agreement in Paris is essential, it is not the end of the climate change story: it is a stepping stone on a much longer journey that requires us to stay alert to the science and remain dynamic in our response"
9273,UNEP-2015-8.txt, The world has already tripled the expected performance on scaling up clean energy and been able to start reversing damage to the ozone layer
9274,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
I firmly believe that if we act on the findings of this report, there is nothing to stop us closing the emissions gap and creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for both the developed and the developing world"
9275,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"

Therefore, the Emissions Gap Report also explores how available financial, technical and capacity building solutions can be scaled up, or even accelerated, to close the gap between the expected and required levels of emissions"
9276,UNEP-2015-8.txt, This includes detailed assessments that look beyond the INDCs to identify the further gains being identified by the International Cooperative Initiatives and by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)
9277,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"

Executive Summary

The year 2015 has the potential to become a turning point in global efforts to transform the prevailing social and economic development paradigm into a more sustainable one"
9278,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The global community reached agreement in September 2015 on a set of 17 sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030, including climate change"
9279,UNEP-2015-8.txt," Countries will meet again at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris with the aim of establishing a new global agreement on climate change, hereafter the `Paris Agreement', with the ambition of limiting changes in global temperatures to below 2°C or 1"

9281,UNEP-2015-8.txt, The Paris Agreement will also aim to establish a framework to provide technological and financial support for developing countries to accelerate the transition towards low carbon and climate resilient development paths
9282,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The architecture of a new climate agreement has many facets with an array of issues under negotiation that have become significantly more complex since the Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 1994"
9283,UNEP-2015-8.txt," The core structure of the Paris Agreement will comprise the ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"" (INDCs) as well as the process by which implementation of the agreement will proceed over time to advance the objectives of the UNFCCC"
9284,UNEP-2015-8.txt," In addition, a number of key decisions will be required covering issues like adaptation, finance, technology, and capacity building"
9285,UNEP-2015-8.txt," What is covered in the 2015 Emissions Gap Report?
This sixth UNEP Emissions Gap Report provides a scientific assessment of the mitigation contributions from the submitted INDCs"
9286,UNEP-2015-8.txt," As in the previous reports, it then compares the resulting emission levels in 2030 with what science tells us is required to be on track towards the agreed target of a global average temperature increase below 2°C

by 2100"
9287,UNEP-2015-8.txt, The Report also provides data for the aspirational target of keeping the temperature increase below 1
9288,UNEP-2015-8.txt," In addition, the Report presents selected areas where enhanced action can be taken, accelerated and scaled up to close the emissions gap"
9289,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The 2015 Emissions Gap Report addresses the following key questions:
· What are the latest estimates of 2025 and 2030 total global emissions levels consistent with the goal of holding the global average temperature rise below 2°C or 1"
9290,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100?
· What is the progress on implementation of the Cancun pledges for the period to 2020?
· Will the combined INDC commitments for 2030 (if fully implemented) be sufficient to stay within the range consistent with the 2°C temperature goal?
· What are possible contributions in selected key areas, where action can be accelerated to enhance the ambition of national pledges both in the period before and after the expected entry into force in 2020 of the Paris Agreement? This year the detailed assessment is on possible mitigation contributions from International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) and enhanced forest-related mitigation activities with a focus on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+)"
9291,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
By 1 October 2015, a total of 119 INDCs had been submitted to the UNFCCC"

9306,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
The IPCC in its fifth assessment report concluded that to limit global warming to below 2°C, the remaining cumulative CO2 emissions ­ the so-called carbon budget ­ are in the order of 1 000 GtCO2"
9307,UNEP-2015-8.txt," This remaining budget can be utilized in different ways, but given the most recent assessment of current trends, net global carbon emissions will eventually need to be reduced to zero between 2060 and 20753"

Enhanced early action (such as moving below the 2020 pledges) is associated with the following economic and technological advantages:

· Encouraging near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term
· Providing early policy signals which are needed for action later in the coming decades

9968,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"6 Concluding remarks
A number of important policy implications can be drawn based on the assessment presented above"
9969,UNEP-2015-8.txt," First, due to the steep rate at which global emissions must decline after 2020 to be consistent with the 2°C scenario, the emissions gap grows rapidly over time"
9970,UNEP-2015-8.txt, This underscores the importance of enhanced early action to reduce emissions
9971,UNEP-2015-8.txt," Secondly, bearing in mind the emissions gap that remains even under the most optimistic assumptions about the INDCs, countries should not assume that these proposed contributions will be sufficient to meet agreed global objectives"
9972,UNEP-2015-8.txt," While an appropriate level of additional ambition would depend on equity considerations, in general, countries should expect that additional ambition will be necessary"
9973,UNEP-2015-8.txt, Failure to anticipate this could result in technological lock-in and stranded assets
9974,UNEP-2015-8.txt," Third, the INDC process has proven to elicit greater ambition from countries relative to a current policy trajectory"
9975,UNEP-2015-8.txt, Future calls for INDCs may therefore be successful in eliciting even greater ambition
9976,UNEP-2015-8.txt, Early calls to enhance ambition for the 2020 to 2030 timeframe can best address the need for enhanced early action
9977,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
In this context the IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014) highlighted that if GHG emissions are above 55 GtCO2e in 2030, challenges of transitioning to low emission levels in line with 2°C in the

longer term will become particularly daunting (Figure 6"
9978,UNEP-2015-8.txt,32 in Clarke et al

9982,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
To sum up, this assessment of the aggregate effect of the INDCs on global total GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 essentially tells two stories"
9983,UNEP-2015-8.txt," First, the INDCs do present a real increase in the levels of ambition compared to a projection of current policies; all global modelling analyses and scenarios based on country-specific data sources assessed, reached this conclusion"

The INDCs represent a real increase in the level of mitigation ambition compared to a continuation of current policies"

10130,UNEP-2015-8.txt," In the context of climate mitigation, ICIs are considered to be cooperative efforts led by actors other than Parties to the UNFCCC, but many are undertaken in partnership with national governments whose agencies are very often critical to the realization of the ICIs' emission reduction potential"
10131,UNEP-2015-8.txt, Many ICIs have strong international partners ­ catalyzing both national and international actions and often providing opportunity for enhancing national ambition
10132,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
Across this spectrum, ICIs cover a wide range of activities, and although it is a challenge to cover them comprehensively, an effort has been made to assess available information and prioritize initiatives according to their potential mitigation significance"
10133,UNEP-2015-8.txt, The chapter starts by presenting the results of a number of recent studies regarding the potential emission reduction contribution of ICIs together with an assessment as to what extent ICI contributions can be considered as additional to those anticipated from the Cancun pledges
10134,UNEP-2015-8.txt," This is followed by an examination of the links between national level cooperative initiatives and the UNFCCC process, with examples from selected INDCs submitted during 2015"
10135,UNEP-2015-8.txt," The chapter then presents a detailed overview of ICIs grouped into three categories, cities and regions, companies and sectors, which helps illustrate the innovative approaches adopted by many non-state actors and facilitate opportunities for identifying new types of partnerships that could contribute to addressing the mitigation challenge"
10136,UNEP-2015-8.txt,"
A particular effort has been made to examine south-south initiatives that may have been under-represented in past reviews"

Executive Summary



Officials responsible for a nation’s economy have been primarily concerned with delivering jobs, stimulating growth, and promoting competitiveness"
10607,WB-2014-5.txt, They are also becoming worried about the effects climate change will inflict on their country’s economic future
10608,WB-2014-5.txt," Increasingly, these officials want to know if there are investments and efforts that can advance urgent development priorities and, at the same time address the challenges of our rapidly warming world"
10609,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    Thanks to a growing body of research, it is now clear that climate-smart development can boost employment and can save millions of lives"
10610,WB-2014-5.txt, Smart development policies and projects can also slow the pace of adverse climate changes
10611,WB-2014-5.txt," Based on this new scientific understanding, and with the development of new economic modeling tools to quantify these benefits, it is clear that the objectives of economic development and climate protection can be complementary"
10612,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    This report uses new modeling tools to examine the full range of benefits ambitious climate mitigation policies can produce across the transportation, industry and building sectors in the United States, China, the European Union, India, Mexico and Brazil"
10613,WB-2014-5.txt, This report also describes the multiple benefits of four development project simulations scaled up to the national level
10614,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    The report builds on recent efforts to estimate the development benefits1 that come with a reduction in climate pollutants"
10615,WB-2014-5.txt," These include economic growth, new jobs, improved crop yields, enhanced energy security, healthier people, and millions of lives saved"
10616,WB-2014-5.txt," In many cases these benefits accrue quickly, and they accrue locally, primarily in the nation where action is taken"
10617,WB-2014-5.txt,"
Why emissions matter
Climate change impacts impose undeniable burdens on economic development by causing significant damage to agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health"
10618,WB-2014-5.txt, These impacts are proving to be devastating for the world’s most vulnerable populations
10619,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases must be substantially reduced to keep the world from exceeding the 2° Celsius threshold of global warming"
10620,WB-2014-5.txt,"2 While efforts to reduce these climate pollutants, despite some progress, have been slow, recent scientific evidence suggests that cutting so-called “short-lived climate pollutants,” which are responsible for up to 40 percent of the current warming, can have immediate climate impacts"
10621,WB-2014-5.txt,"3 Complementary actions on greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants can slow the rate of near-term warming, push back dangerous tipping points4 and provide time to allow the world’s poorest people to adapt to the changing climate"
10622,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    Among the short-lived climate pollutants, black carbon and methane are climate forcers but they are also air pollutants that injure human health and diminish agriculture production"
10623,WB-2014-5.txt," By reducing them, it is possible to prevent the deaths of 2"
10624,WB-2014-5.txt,4 million people and boost crop production by 32 million tons of crops that would have been lost each year
10625,WB-2014-5.txt,"5 In rural areas, millions of people can be saved from premature death by switching to clean cooking solutions"
10626,WB-2014-5.txt," In cities, commuters can save time, and many thousands of asthma and heart attacks can be alleviated, through improved transit systems"
10627,WB-2014-5.txt," Limiting these pollutants through smart development enhances economies, stimulates production, leaves populations healthier and slows the rate of climate change"
10628,WB-2014-5.txt,"
Achieving development and climate goals simultaneously
Policies that reduce GHG emissions and other short-lived climate pollutants can have clear economic, health, and other social benefits"
10629,WB-2014-5.txt," For example, a policy that encourages more efficient transportation—including fuel efficient vehicles, and effective public transit—will save fuel and time which improves energy security and labor productivity"
10630,WB-2014-5.txt," These policies can also reduce smog-related respiratory problems, thus saving lives, and improve visibility, benefiting local investment in sectors such as tourism and recreation"
10631,WB-2014-5.txt," Similarly, a project to improve solid waste management may initially be pursued for its sanitation and health benefits; it can also reduce methane emissions that may boost crop yields and save energy"
10632,WB-2014-5.txt, All these gains directly contribute to economic growth
10633,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    At the project level, these benefits have often been left out of economic analyses because many health and environmental benefits were not easily quantifiable"
10634,WB-2014-5.txt, This has left decision makers with analyses that are incomplete
10635,WB-2014-5.txt, Recent efforts to better estimate the full impacts of proposed development projects have produced several new analytical tools and models
10636,WB-2014-5.txt," With these new tools, economists can more fully assess the multiple impacts of pollutants and estimate the value of emission reductions"
10637,WB-2014-5.txt, Today’s tools can also model the synergistic impacts of harms and benefits as they flow through the economy
10638,WB-2014-5.txt,"
A framework to assess benefits
This report attempts to quantify investments that represent a true economic gain in terms of increased economic productivity"
10639,WB-2014-5.txt,6 It does so by applying new modeling tools that give a fuller accounting of the benefits of near-term and long-term climate and development interventions
10640,WB-2014-5.txt," The report:
• Introduces a holistic, adaptable framework to capture and measure the multiple benefits of reducing emissions of several pollutants
• Demonstrates how local and national policymakers, members of the international development community, and others can use this framework to design and analyze policies and projects
• Contributes a compelling rationale for effectively combining climate action with sustainable development and green growth worldwide
    The report responds to demand from countries that are striving to advance local development priorities and needs for resilient, low carbon growth"
10641,WB-2014-5.txt," By looking at policies and projects more holistically, one can better assess the overall value of actions that reduce emissions of GHGs and short-lived climate pollutants, and provide a more compelling case for coordinated development and climate action"
10642,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    The report proposes the following framework to analyze policies and projects:
1"
10643,WB-2014-5.txt," Identify the full range of benefits that result from a project or policy, including improved health, crop yields, energy savings, job growth, labor productivity, and economic growth
2"
10644,WB-2014-5.txt," Select appropriate assessment tools that provide insight on each measurable benefit

10646,WB-2014-5.txt," Estimate the full range of benefits and present results using metrics relevant to the audience
    Several simulated case studies are used in this study to demonstrate how to apply this analytical framework"
10647,WB-2014-5.txt," The case studies cover multiple pollutants (particulate matter, primarily black carbon; and GHGs, including methane, a precursor to ozone, and C02) and multiple sectors (transportation, industry, buildings, waste, and agriculture)"
10648,WB-2014-5.txt," They demonstrate the frameworks’ benefits from two perspectives: sector policies applied at the national or regional level, and projects implemented at the sub-national level"

10650,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    The report focuses on assessing the multiple benefits of simulated policy and project case studies"
10651,WB-2014-5.txt, These analyses should be viewed as “full implementation simulations”7 relative to a business-as-usual scenario
10652,WB-2014-5.txt," The benefits quantified have an optimistic bias because they do not necessarily include transaction costs, risks, market distortions, and other factors that would be included in a policy implementation evaluation"
10653,WB-2014-5.txt," Nonetheless, they offer an important building block to refine the approaches, methods, and tools for multiple-benefit analysis"
10654,WB-2014-5.txt, The results also highlight the need to fine-tune the modeling tools to represent real-world conditions more accurately
10655,WB-2014-5.txt,"
Case studies demonstrate sizeable benefits
Three simulated case studies analyzed the effects of key sector policies to determine the benefits realized in six regions® (the United States, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, and Brazil) and the impact on global GDP"
10656,WB-2014-5.txt," The sector policies include regulations, taxes, and incentives to stimulate a shift to clean transport, improved industrial energy efficiency, and more energy efficient buildings and appliances"

10680,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    As a result of limitations in the framework and available modeling tools, this report does not provide project-level evaluation for decision making nor does it focus on policy implementation issues or costs, which are required for comprehensive policy evaluation"
10681,WB-2014-5.txt,12 The report does however highlight areas where additional research could improve limitations with the framework
10682,WB-2014-5.txt," For example, improved tools are needed to account for behavioral changes such as shifting to public transit and advanced cookstoves, and to explicitly account for the full climate change costs of emissions"
10683,WB-2014-5.txt,13 The framework also needs additional work to tailor its application at the individual project level
10684,WB-2014-5.txt," Areas for research include:
• Further benefits assessments based on more comprehensive emissions data
• Multi-sector macroeconomic analysis that better illustrates the synergistic benefits (for example, using cleaner energy sources to supply the increased power demand for electric cars could yield greater benefits than clean transport or clean power in isolation)
• Additional macroeconomic analysis to reflect the additional benefits of green versus non-green investment options
    As scientists continue to clarify the many ways that local air pollution, short-lived climate pollutants, and greenhouse gases harm health, welfare, and the environment, the framework presented in this report can be honed to better account for these costs by providing more complete economic analyses"
10685,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    Ultimately, climate change is an issue for the whole economy and all facets of development"
10686,WB-2014-5.txt," All policy makers, whether in government cabinets or corporate boardrooms, need to understand where they can get development and climate benefits from the decisions they make"

Introduction




Background
Climate change is a fundamental threat to sustainable economic development, with devastating impacts on agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and human health"
10689,WB-2014-5.txt," Immediate, substantial reductions in C02 and other long-lived GHGs are needed to avoid a 4°C warmer world (UNEP 2011a)"
10690,WB-2014-5.txt," While every region will be affected, those least able to adapt—the poor and most vulnerable-will be hit hardest"
10691,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    The large and dominant role of C02 emissions in raising global average temperature remains unchanged; understanding of the effects of greenhouse gases and other pollutants on the climate system, however, is improving"
10692,WB-2014-5.txt," Other pollutants—namely methane (CH4), ozone (03), black carbon (BC), and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), collectively referred to as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)—are now recognized for their potency and as a significant cause of global warming (Methane and HFCs are included in the Kyoto protocol)"
10693,WB-2014-5.txt," Although these pollutants have a much shorter lifetime14 in the atmosphere than C02, recent estimates indicate that SLCPs may be responsible for 30-40 percent of overall present-day global warming (Molina et al"

10699,WB-2014-5.txt,"
    To avoid the long-term threat of climate change, the world must still reduce C02 emissions"
10700,WB-2014-5.txt," But reducing SLCP emissions could slow the rate of warming over the next two to four decades, providing time for the poor and vulnerable to adapt to a changing climate"

Win-win Opportunities
Many projects and policies offer the opportunity to control C02 and SLCP emissions simultaneously; doing so can deliver both local socioeconomic benefits and global climate benefits, and reduce the net cost of action to mitigate climate change"

New Framework to Estimate Benefits






The analysis presented in this report uses recently developed emissions modeling and assessment tools and an integrated macroeconomic model"
10764,WB-2014-5.txt, Prior analyses added some environmental externalities into cost-benefit analyses by quantifying and monetizing specific benefits and adding them individually to the benefits side of the ledger

10775,WB-2014-5.txt, Identify appropriate benefits assessment tools: These should include available tools that provide insight on each measurable benefit at the scale or resolution appropriate to the analysis
10776,WB-2014-5.txt, Selection (or development) of suitable analytical tools is critical

Step 3: Identify an Appropriate Macroeconomic Tool
 For all of the case studies in this report, the outputs from the MACC, FAS ST, and other tools are fed into the Global Energy Industry Model (GEIM) from Oxford Economics, which calculates the macroeconomic implications of climate and air quality interventions"

Limitations of Bottom-up and Macroeconomic Modeling
Combining bottom-up (MACC) and top-down (macroeconomic modeling) approaches has advantages and disadvantages"
10840,WB-2014-5.txt," Bottom- up models disaggregate energy consumption across sectors and consider specific energy technologies with technical and economic parameters, but they often neglect to account for feedbacks in the economy and the effects of international energy markets"

    In this analysis, the GEIM model deals with Keynesian effects to some extent by recognizing the long-term drag on the economy caused by capital investment"
10851,WB-2014-5.txt, Any additional investment that does not improve efficiency or expand productive capacity puts a drag on the economy in the long term
10852,WB-2014-5.txt," The transmission channel for this is essentially crowding out: the additional investment increases demand and, as a result, GDP and the rate of inflation; in response, the central bank raises interest rates, which causes demand (in particular investment) to fall and GDP to move back toward baseline levels"
10853,WB-2014-5.txt," If the additional investment is large enough, it will crowd out a significant portion of capacity-expanding investment, which will in turn result in lower potential and actual output in the long run"

Climate change and migration are major concerns in the MENA region, yet the empirical evidence on the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on migration remains limited"
11237,WB-2014-6.txt," Information is broadly lacking on how households in vulnerable areas perceive changes in the climate, how they are affected by extreme weather events, whether they benefit from community and government programs to help them cope with and adapt to a changing climate, and how these conditions influence the decision of household members to migrate, either temporarily or permanently"
11238,WB-2014-6.txt," This introductory chapter summarizes briefly the main results of the study which relied on existing data as well as focus groups and new household surveys collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen"
11239,WB-2014-6.txt," The results suggest that households do perceive important changes in the climate, and that many households are being affected by extreme weather events resulting in losses in income, crops, and livestock"
11240,WB-2014-6.txt," The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with weather shocks are diverse, but also limited, with most households not able to recover from the negative impact of weather shocks"

Introduction
Do households living in climate-affected areas in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region believe that changes in climate patterns and their environment are taking place? Have households been affected by extreme weather events, and in that case to what extent and which events have had the largest impact? What are the coping strategies that households declare having used, or could be using to cope with climate change and weather shocks? To what extent are perceived and actual changes in weather patterns and the environment driving temporary and permanent migration flows in MENA countries? Finally, to what extent do remittances reach households living in climate poor areas, and what is the impact of such remittances on poverty and human development indicators?

It is widely acknowledged that the MENA region will be strongly affected by climate change, and yet the current evidence on the relationship between climate change and migration in the MENA region is weaker than in most other regions (see Foresight 2011)"
11244,WB-2014-6.txt," This study is not meant to review the limited evidence on climate change in the MENA region, nor does it provide specific policy recommendations (for a recent study doing just that, see Verner 2012; on the evidence and policies related to climate change worldwide, see World Bank 2010; and on migration, see Foresight 2011)"
11245,WB-2014-6.txt," The aim of the study is more modest: it is to provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between weather patterns, perceptions of climate change, and migration so that at least partial answers can be provided to the questions asked above"
11246,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This introductory overview chapter summarizes the main results of the study"
11247,WB-2014-6.txt, A more detailed synthesis is provided in chapter 1 (Wodon et al
11248,WB-2014-6.txt," The study is based in part on new household surveys collected in 2011 in climate-affected areas in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen"
11249,WB-2014-6.txt," On purpose, in order to achieve variability in the data collected, the selection of the countries and areas sampled within countries included some countries and areas highly vulnerable to droughts, as is the case in Syria, and others much less vulnerable, as is the case in Egypt (given that Egypt's agriculture is mostly irrigated)"
11250,WB-2014-6.txt," The sample of countries also included low income countries such as the Republic of Yemen, and higher-income countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Moroco, and Syria"
11251,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, the sample included countries and areas affected by diverse types of extreme weather events, including both droughts and floods (for example in some areas of Morocco)"
11252,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Beyond survey data collection generating quantitative data, the study also relies in part on qualitative focus groups implemented in both urban and rural areas in the five countries in 2011"
11253,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, some of the analysis is based on previously existing survey data for Morocco, as well as survey and census data for the Republic of Yemen"
11254,WB-2014-6.txt," The context that led to the study and the literature to which it contributes, as well as the approach used for both quantitative and qualitative data collection are discussed in chapters 2 and 3"
11255,WB-2014-6.txt, This introduction focuses on the main empirical results which are provided in a series of technical papers in chapters 4 through 12
11256,WB-2014-6.txt,"
One important caveat is required before presenting the main results"
11257,WB-2014-6.txt," It is sometimes said that ""Climate is what we expect"
11258,WB-2014-6.txt, Weather is what we get
11259,WB-2014-6.txt,""" Simply put, climate relates to the distribution of variables such as temperature and rainfall over a period of time, often 30 years at least"
11260,WB-2014-6.txt," This distribution is characterized by its moments, including the mean and the variance of key climatic variables"
11261,WB-2014-6.txt, Climate change is then used to refer to the change in the distribution of rainfall and temperature
11262,WB-2014-6.txt," However, it is difficult to tell if the weather experienced at any point in time is due to a change in climate (the overall mean and variance of rainfall and temperature) or is simply part of an existing distribution"
11263,WB-2014-6.txt," The implication for this study is that our results do not provide clear new evidence on the direct relationship between climate change and migration per se, but the results do contribute to the evidence on three specific related issues: (1) the impact of weather shocks on migration; (2) the impact of perceptions of recent climate
change on migration; and (3) the impact of climate patterns (but not directly climate change) on migration"
11264,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Perceptions and Impacts of Weather Shocks on Households
Do households living in rural areas susceptible of being affected by climate change believe that changes in climate patterns are taking place? Questions on perceptions of climate change and migration were asked with a focus on events and changes that took place in the last five years, bur the analysis of migration is done both for the last five years and for longer periods"
11265,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Table O"
11266,WB-2014-6.txt,1 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a) suggests that indeed households do believe that the climate has been changing in recent years
11267,WB-2014-6.txt," In the combined sample for the five countries where new household surveys were implemented, more than three fourths of households declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters say that temperatures are higher"
11268,WB-2014-6.txt," Between half and two thirds declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent"
11269,WB-2014-6.txt," The changes in climate in turn appear to lead to more diseases in animals and livestock, more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion"
11270,WB-2014-6.txt," Some of the extreme weather events associated with climate change such as rainstorms and floods are not perceived as more frequent by a majority of households, and in some cases, households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler, and that there is more rain, but this is a minority of households"
11271,WB-2014-6.txt," But overall, while there are differences between households and areas or countries, there is a clear perception that the climate is worsening"
11272,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In focus groups as well the majority of respondents mentioned long-term shifts in climate and they attributed declining agriculture fortunes to deteriorating environmental conditions caused by changing weather patterns (Grant et al"
11273,WB-2014-6.txt," For crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results may be devastating: ""Rice is burnt in some seasons, because we cannot find enough water to irrigate it"" (Male,

36­45 years old, Egypt1)"
11274,WB-2014-6.txt, The inability to earn a stable income for crops makes it difficult to rely solely on agriculture as a source of revenue
11275,WB-2014-6.txt," ""The conditions [for] farming are very poor"
11276,WB-2014-6.txt, There's drought on the one hand and the unavailability of the new equipment and poor methods we use on the other hand
11277,WB-2014-6.txt," All farmers in this region have been affected by the drought and lost their yields"" (Male, 35­45 years old, Algeria)"
11278,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Republic of Yemen, residents from Hudaydah emphasized the problems of warm weather and increasing heat waves"
11279,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, unfavorable crop prices have led some growers to shift from cultivating food crops to qat which is more profitable but requires a great deal of water: ""People there [in villages] work shoulder to shoulder, but the problem lies in agriculture"
11280,WB-2014-6.txt, They have stopped cultivating crops 
11281,WB-2014-6.txt," and replaced them with qat"" (Male, 30­39 years old, the Republic of Yemen)"
11282,WB-2014-6.txt," Importantly, as shown in table O"
11283,WB-2014-6.txt,"2, many households are affected by weather shocks, especially in terms of crop and income losses, but also in terms of losses in livestock and less fish caught"
11284,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Additional information on perceptions about the climate, weather shocks, and their impact on households is available for Morocco through special modules on climate change and shocks incorporated in a national survey implemented in 2009/10 (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a)"
11285,WB-2014-6.txt," In the survey, as shown in table O"
11286,WB-2014-6.txt,"3, 28"
11287,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percent of households were involved in agriculture, and among those 92"
11288,WB-2014-6.txt,1 percent declared having been affected by deteriorating climatic conditions in the last five years
11289,WB-2014-6.txt," The most likely shock was a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall, mentioned by 62"
11290,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent of agricultural households
11291,WB-2014-6.txt," In a separate part of the survey, more than one in five households declared having been affected by a recent weather shock such as a drought or flood"
11292,WB-2014-6.txt," Most of the households that were affected declared that they had not been able to recover from the shock, and this was especially the case among poorer households"
11293,WB-2014-6.txt," According to regression analysis, households in the top quintile of wealth were 20 percentage points more likely to recover from weather shocks than households in the bottom quintile"
11294,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Coping and Adaptation Strategies
What are the coping strategies that households declare having used, or could be using to cope with climate change and weather shocks? In the five country sample, 60"
11295,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent of households declare that they have used or would use their savings, 46"
11296,WB-2014-6.txt,"8 have sold or would sell their assets, 46"
11297,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 percent have asked
for a loan or would do so, 40"
11298,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent have sold or would sell their livestock, and 36"
11299,WB-2014-6.txt,4 percent have withdrawn or would withdraw their children from school (Adoho and Wodon 2014b)
11300,WB-2014-6.txt, The proportions of households resorting to these coping strategies are higher among lower quintiles which have fewer other means to cope
11301,WB-2014-6.txt," There are differences between countries, especially regarding the possibility of withdrawing children from school--in Egypt this is not being considered by most households"
11302,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, households receiving international remittances, which tend to be better off, are less likely to resort to these various coping strategies, except using their savings"
11303,WB-2014-6.txt," The qualitative focus groups also reveal different coping strategies, including selling assets, shifting food consumption habits, and removing children from school to have them support the household (Grant et al"
11304,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes"
11305,WB-2014-6.txt, As shown in table O
11306,WB-2014-6.txt,"4 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b), between one in four and one in five households have relied or would rely more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought or would seek off-farm work, have used or would use more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made or would make a change in their farm production technology"
11307,WB-2014-6.txt," Undertaking training for non-farmwork or changing crop mixes and varieties is mentioned by about 15 percent of households, versus only 9 percent for changing the crops versus livestock mix"
11308,WB-2014-6.txt, Thus most households do not implement many adaptation strategies
11309,WB-2014-6.txt," However more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of the community due to climate pressures, and 14 percent say that some people have moved in, which may generate conflict over water, land, or livestock"
11310,WB-2014-6.txt,"

The qualitative work suggests that residents often rely on each other to cope and adapt: ""Rural residents are willing to pay [give] half of what we have to help others"
11311,WB-2014-6.txt," If I have 10 pounds, I will pay 5"
11312,WB-2014-6.txt," If I have 100 pounds, I will pay 50"
11313,WB-2014-6.txt, This is how the social norms work here
11314,WB-2014-6.txt," We are all one family"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Egypt)"
11315,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet solidarity does not always work, and conflicts over natural resources do occur due to changes in climate, as the estimates in table O"
11316,WB-2014-6.txt,3 show
11317,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Republic of Yemen in particular, rural residents worried in the focus groups that water scarcity has led to conflict over access to wells"
11318,WB-2014-6.txt, One woman described a water distribution scheme where water is distributed to certain communities on certain days of the week
11319,WB-2014-6.txt," For farmers in all five countries, living in impoverished rural areas is not only difficult financially, but it also has negative impacts for health, a concern mentioned in Egyptian focus groups"
11320,WB-2014-6.txt, Farmers may be increasingly exposed to contaminated water because waste leaks into irrigation canals
11321,WB-2014-6.txt, Others mention being sick
11322,WB-2014-6.txt," With only limited income at their disposal, many households cannot afford quality health care and they also often cannot access health facilities (Grant et al"
11323,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What about community-level responses? Households were asked whether to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which they live did any of the following: planting trees or installing soil protection measures; building banks on rivers, streams, or small check banks to reduce flooding; developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation, or roads; gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income, or livestock; taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts; and taking action to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment"
11324,WB-2014-6.txt, In most cases community action is limited
11325,WB-2014-6.txt," As shown by Adoho and Wodon (2014b), only one in five households declare that the community has planted trees or taken soil erosion measures, and one in seven mentioned measures to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment"
11326,WB-2014-6.txt, The other actions are mentioned by only one in ten households or less
11327,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Similar questions were asked about governments, albeit with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the
provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low"
11328,WB-2014-6.txt," Except for the provision of drinking water which is probably less related to climate change and shocks, government involvement in adaptation strategies and safety nets is also limited"
11329,WB-2014-6.txt," For most programs, only about one in ten households declared that the government has been active"
11330,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The fact that community and government programs to help households cope with weather shocks and adapt to climate change are the exception rather than the rule was also a conclusion of the qualitative work"
11331,WB-2014-6.txt," When asked about such programs, respondents said that they were aware of few programs and organizations geared toward assisting the rural poor affected by climate change"
11332,WB-2014-6.txt," Participants suggested areas where government initiatives could help, such as the provision of agricultural inputs or loans to purchase machinery"
11333,WB-2014-6.txt, Job training and improved employment opportunities were also mentioned
11334,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet some respondents, especially in the Republic of Yemen, were doubtful that government program would bear fruit, due to corruption and distrust"
11335,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Migration
Migration is also a widespread strategy to cope with and adapt to changes in climatic and environmental conditions"
11336,WB-2014-6.txt," In the five country sample, the data suggest that three in every 10 households (29"
11337,WB-2014-6.txt,"9 percent) have migrants, whether residents (current members of the households) or nonresidents (former members of the household)"
11338,WB-2014-6.txt, Lower rates are obtained when restricting migration to the last five years
11339,WB-2014-6.txt," At the individual level, 7"
11340,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent of individuals in the sample as a whole have migrated temporarily, and the proportion over the last five years is 6"
11341,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent
11342,WB-2014-6.txt," For permanent migration, the rates are 8"
11343,WB-2014-6.txt,"0 percent in the sample as a whole, and 5"
11344,WB-2014-6.txt,7 percent in the last five years (Adoho and Wodon 2014c)
11345,WB-2014-6.txt," Most migration is internal, but the likelihood of migration abroad is high in Egypt and also in general higher for individuals from higher quintiles, as expected due to the cost of international migration"
11346,WB-2014-6.txt," For both residents and nonresidents, migration to urban areas, and especially to large cities, is much more likely than migration to rural areas"
11347,WB-2014-6.txt,"
To what extent are households migrating away from climate-affected areas, and is climate itself a key push factor in such migration? This is a complex question"
11348,WB-2014-6.txt," Regression results suggest that poor climate and extreme weather events lead to a higher probability of migration, but the role of climate is smaller than that of socioeconomic characteristics and job prospects in cities"
11349,WB-2014-6.txt," More precisely, data from the five country sample are used by Adoho and Wodon (2014c) to construct two indices or factors that summarize household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment"
11350,WB-2014-6.txt," The first factor captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts"
11351,WB-2014-6.txt," The second factor captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods"
11352,WB-2014-6.txt, Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one
11353,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the regression analysis with the five country sample, higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of resident or temporary migration, with the coefficients being statistically significant and the effects of each of the two factors of a similar order of magnitude"
11354,WB-2014-6.txt," The effects for nonresident or permanent migration are similar, although statistically significant only for the whole period, as opposed to the last five years"
11355,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus overall higher values for both factors result in higher rates of both temporary and permanent migration, but with weaker evidence for permanent migration"
11356,WB-2014-6.txt, The regression estimates suggest that a significant deterioration of climatic conditions would lead to an increase of about 1
11357,WB-2014-6.txt,5 percentage point for both types of migration
11358,WB-2014-6.txt," Given the overall migration rate, this increase would represent between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed, and its magnitude is of an order of magnitude similar to that obtained when considering the reasons stated by households for the migration of some of their members"
11359,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Additional evidence for Morocco from Nguyen and Wodon (2014b) using the national survey for 2009/10 mentioned earlier suggest that weather shocks increase the likelihood of temporary migration by slightly more than one percentage point, an order of magnitude again similar to that observed in the five country sample"
11360,WB-2014-6.txt," While in the Morocco national survey, the impact of weather shocks on permanent migration is not statistically significant, the impact of changing structural conditions such as reduced agricultural yields due to lack of water is, and it does contribute to higher permanent migration away from the affected areas"
11361,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, using a different approach based on combining census and weather station data from the Republic of Yemen, Joseph and Wodon (2014a) find that climate variables do affect migration from some districts to other districts, but in a somewhat limited way, with socioeconomic and cost factors playing a much more prominent role"
11362,WB-2014-6.txt," This analysis, which is based on past data, suggest that migration flows are unlikely to increase sharply in the near term, but if conditions were to change drastically, the effect of weather variables on migration could become much larger (Joseph, Wodon, and Blankespoor 2014)"
11363,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The focus groups data reported in Grant et al"
11364,WB-2014-6.txt," (2013) also suggest a link between climate and migration, although again the role of socioeconomic factors is probably at least as important as that of climatic conditions"
11365,WB-2014-6.txt," Respondents linked migration to chronic droughts which lead to declining agricultural productivity: ""The lack of water has resulted in a failure to be able to cultivate rice and it is an important crop"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt)"
11366,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, few mentioned flooding or being displaced as a result of natural disasters as a reason for relocation"
11367,WB-2014-6.txt, Respondents appear to choose migration after other strategies have proven unsuccessful
11368,WB-2014-6.txt," The qualitative work also suggests that remittances are important, especially in the Republic of Yemen where there is a long-standing tradition of migration to Saudi Arabia"
11369,WB-2014-6.txt," But conversely consequences can be severed in the absence of remittances: ""My brother is in Saudi Arabia"
11370,WB-2014-6.txt," He used to send me money all of the time and we were well off, even when I wasn't working"
11371,WB-2014-6.txt, [But] we lost the house and everything we [owned] because of the discontinuity of these aids
11372,WB-2014-6.txt," We live at God's mercy"" (Male, 30­45 years old, Hudaydah, the
Republic of Yemen)"
11373,WB-2014-6.txt, Participants in focus groups from Morocco and Algeria did not depend on remittances as much
11374,WB-2014-6.txt," Though urban residents in Algeria, Morocco, Syria, and Egypt overwhelmingly report sending remittances back home, the Republic of Yemeni urban respondents by contrast were more likely to receive remittances from family members working abroad, especially again from Saudi Arabia"
11375,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What happens to the migrants once they leave? Many migrants hope to work and save enough to own their own business (a small store or shop)"
11376,WB-2014-6.txt," Finding jobs, however, is not an easy feat amid widespread joblessness found throughout the region, given that unemployment levels hover around 15 percent, and a much higher 20­40 percent among youth 15­30 years old"
11377,WB-2014-6.txt," While some migrants find urban communities receptive, others say they were met with hostility: ""They look at us and call us `Berber countrymen"
11378,WB-2014-6.txt,"' They think we are invaders"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco)"
11379,WB-2014-6.txt," Some rural migrants said that they felt disadvantaged vis-à-vis urban dwellers because they lacked what is needed to secure proper employment, especially a degree and French- and Arabic-speaking capability, both of which tend to be needed even for jobs requiring minimal skills"
11380,WB-2014-6.txt," For the Republic of Yemenis, the main obstacle to finding a job may be corruption, which appears to be deep and pervasive: ""You need to bribe your way into a position"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa)"
11381,WB-2014-6.txt," Finding adequate housing was also a challenge: ""I'm 39, married, with five kids and I don't have a flat of my own"

11398,WB-2014-6.txt,5 summarizes in a very stylized way the main results from the analysis
11399,WB-2014-6.txt," The evidence suggests that worsening climatic conditions, or the perceptions thereof, are clearly a push factor leading to temporary migration away from the affected (mostly rural), but the evidence is a bit weaker for permanent migration"
11400,WB-2014-6.txt," It must be noted that in an analysis such as that of Joseph and Wodon (2014a), which is at the level of a country as a whole, the impact of the climate on the
overall patterns of migration tends to be diluted"
11401,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, in the analysis based on the five countries sample, as well as when looking at weather shocks with the national Morocco survey, the effects are estimated mostly on those affected by these shocks, which also explains why the impacts are larger in affected areas"
11402,WB-2014-6.txt," In those areas, it seems fair to suggest that climatic conditions account for at least 10­20 percent of the current migration flows, and this could increase in the future"
11403,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Remittances
The last part of the study includes two chapters looking at remittances in the case of the Republic of Yemen"
11404,WB-2014-6.txt," There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms"
11405,WB-2014-6.txt, It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks
11406,WB-2014-6.txt," The first chapter in the last part of the study by Joseph, Wodon, and Blankespoor (2014) use a national household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received"
11407,WB-2014-6.txt," The question is whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances"
11408,WB-2014-6.txt, The results suggest that this is not the case in the Republic of Yemen
11409,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the last chapter of the study, Joseph and Wodon (2014b) use matching techniques and the same household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition)"
11410,WB-2014-6.txt, The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate
11411,WB-2014-6.txt, Four main results are obtained
11412,WB-2014-6.txt," First, remittances--which are substantial in the Republic of Yemen--tend to have
positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition"
11413,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances"
11414,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable"
11415,WB-2014-6.txt," Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment"
11416,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances may be used more for investments, including in the education of children"
11417,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Conclusion and Policy Implications
A solid foundation for decision making related to climate change adaptation involves four iterative steps: (1) Assessing climate risks, impacts, and opportunities for action; (2) Prioritizing policy and project options; (3) Implementing responses in sectors and regions; and (4) Monitoring and evaluating implementation, then reassessing the climate risks, impacts, and opportunities (Verner 2012)"
11418,WB-2014-6.txt, Our work falls squarely within the first of these four steps
11419,WB-2014-6.txt," As mentioned in the introduction, the aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of perceptions of climate change, environmental degradation, and extreme weather events and their relationship to migration and other coping strategies in the MENA region"
11420,WB-2014-6.txt," Quantitative and qualitative data collection activities were implemented in climate-affected areas in five countries, and existing census and survey data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen were used as well"
11421,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis suggests that a majority of households do perceive important changes in the climate, such as more erratic rain, higher temperatures, less rain, dryer and less fertile land, and more frequent droughts"
11422,WB-2014-6.txt,"
These changes have led to a range of negative consequences for agriculture and livestock production, and extreme weather events have been associated with losses in incomes, crops, and livestock"
11423,WB-2014-6.txt," The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse, including migration, selling various assets and taking other emergency measures to get by, as well as changing the household's sources of livelihoods in terms of crops, livestock production, and off-farm work among others"
11424,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet many households do not appear to use these strategies, and in addition the extent to which they benefit from community and government programs and initiatives to help them cope with weather or environmental changes is limited"
11425,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In terms of migration, the study suggests that the impact of weather shocks and deteriorating conditions on migration is positive, leading to higher temporary and
permanent migration"
11426,WB-2014-6.txt," In the areas most affected by climate change, the analysis suggests that climate factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climatic conditions continue to deteriorate"
11427,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, while many migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and their ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed, especially given intense competition for relatively few good job opportunities"
11428,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Beyond addressing an existing research gap though, the findings provide much ground for policy development"
11429,WB-2014-6.txt, Five broad areas of implications for policy are highlighted below
11430,WB-2014-6.txt,"
First, affected communities call for more government action to help with adaptation"
11431,WB-2014-6.txt," In line with the conclusions reached in the recent study led by Verner (2012) on adaptation in the MENA region, we have shown the extent to which households in vulnerable rural areas are affected by climate change and weather shocks, and how their ability to cope and adapt to these shocks is limited"
11432,WB-2014-6.txt," The cost of climate change and weather shocks is already felt today by many rural households, which are essentially left on their own in the absence of strong community responses and government programs in the geographic areas studied"
11433,WB-2014-6.txt," While we have not conducted any cost-benefit analysis to assess which types of programs might help households the most in rural sending areas--such analysis would need to take local conditions into account, we have demonstrated the need for more assistance in order to help households cope and adapt, given the substantial damage already caused to livelihoods by changing weather patterns"
11434,WB-2014-6.txt," The populations sampled in this study perceive a lack of effective government interventions to address the impacts of climate change and the migration it generates, and collective action solutions do not seem to work"
11435,WB-2014-6.txt," The gap in the public provision and financing of adaption interventions leaves individuals and communities alone in making choices and decisions, including through migration"
11436,WB-2014-6.txt," Although this leaves space for private initiatives, it also leaves the space vulnerable to forms of uncoordinated action that may lead to conflict and maladaptation"
11437,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The role of safety nets and broader social protection programs is especially important in this context, both for migrants and their families in sending areas"
11438,WB-2014-6.txt, MENA governments should be encouraged to adopt and expand the coverage of their social protection and safety net programs
11439,WB-2014-6.txt, The coverage of those programs appears very thin in the areas surveyed for this study
11440,WB-2014-6.txt, Investments in safety net systems could have immediate pay-offs in the short run as well as in the long run when the consequences of climatic change may become more obvious
11441,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, it would be important to highlight the fact that the design, coverage, and placement of safety net programs would not be just for the purpose of minimizing the future impacts of climate change; instead safety nets should be seen as an integral part of the governments' broader strategy toward poverty reduction and urbanization and they should provide portable skills and human capital to the segments of the population that need it the most (we come back to this below)"
11442,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Second, migration policy needs to understand and address climate-induced migration in the context of other push and pull factors"
11443,WB-2014-6.txt," The study has shown that while environmental and climatic factors do play a role in driving migration, a range of other socioeconomic factors are at play"
11444,WB-2014-6.txt," Although uncertainties remain as to the magnitude of future climate change and its effects on migration, focusing on environmental degradation alone as the dominant driver of migration would be misleading"
11445,WB-2014-6.txt," Similarly, characterizing environmental degradation as key driver of transborder migration is also potentially misleading: in the countries studies, when environmental factors play a role, migration is mostly internal"
11446,WB-2014-6.txt," These findings run somewhat against the received wisdom behind much of the recent global hype around climate migration, but they are in line with the results of other assessments, including the recently released Foresight report on environmental change and migration (Foresight 2011)"
11447,WB-2014-6.txt, Identifying climate migration more squarely as a domestic policy issue will lead to a different type of attention to the problem for both domestic policy makers in MENA countries and donors alike
11448,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Third, migration can be conceived of as a form of adaptation, but it is often seen as a solution of last resort by households, especially in the qualitative work presented in this study"
11449,WB-2014-6.txt," One reason for this is that migration may be perceived as more costly than other strategies such as using savings, selling assets, getting into debt, or withdrawing children from school"
11450,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition to material costs (travelling and relodging), migration implies substantial risks due to unknown outcomes (finding other forms of livelihood) in addition to immaterial costs such those as stemming from the uprooting of individuals, households, and sometimes even communities"
11451,WB-2014-6.txt," In some cases, those left behind, whether at the level of the household or the community may be precluded from reaping the benefits from migration, especially when remittances are hampered by the high cost of remitting or by the fact that migrants have a hard time finding jobs"
11452,WB-2014-6.txt,"
At the same time policy responses and development interventions need to recognize that migration represents a viable and legitimate mechanism through which people can address risks to their livelihoods and wider well-being, and a means of adapting to climate change and its impacts"
11453,WB-2014-6.txt," A key question for migration policy is therefore where migration should be treated as a risk to be managed and mitigated, and where it should be treated as an opportunity to be facilitated or even encouraged"
11454,WB-2014-6.txt, Enabling communities in sending areas to better leverage the potential benefits of migration and increase their adaptive capacity is often a better alternative than their progressive displacement
11455,WB-2014-6.txt," The effective economic insertion of migrants in urban areas leads to opportunities for the sending communities, particularly thanks to the transfer of remittances"
11456,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, the evidence from the surveys and the qualitative work suggests a positive impact of remittances in areas affected by climate shocks, especially in terms of human development outcomes"
11457,WB-2014-6.txt," Without a facilitating environment though, remittances are too often turned into pure consumption and the accumulation of nonproductive assets"
11458,WB-2014-6.txt," This type of assets can be of little value both in terms of preventive and ex-post adaptation, as their investment contribution is limited and they are not liquid enough to be used when climate impacts strike, at which point their value
can drop"
11459,WB-2014-6.txt," Policy should focus on leveraging the impacts of remittances by encouraging their productive use, for instance by subsidizing forms of defiscalization for remittance-funded investments and community saving schemes which also facilitate financial integration and increase liquidity"
11460,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Fourth, urban development policy is a fundamental component of the policy package to address climate induced migration"
11461,WB-2014-6.txt," Most of the study focuses on sending areas, but the qualitative work conducted in urban areas suggests that the integration of migrants into major destination cities is not working as well as it should"
11462,WB-2014-6.txt," The study shows that climate-induced migration tends to be toward cities, mostly large ones"
11463,WB-2014-6.txt, The policy responses to climate shocks and migration are therefore to be found in cities as much as in sending areas
11464,WB-2014-6.txt," Concerns about employment and housing abound among migrants, with migration simply adding to existing pressures that can be dealt with only through broad-based economic development not necessarily focused on migration per se"
11465,WB-2014-6.txt, The climate induced migration problem should be part of a broader policy debate about urbanization
11466,WB-2014-6.txt, Most MENA countries are rapidly urbanizing
11467,WB-2014-6.txt," While the share of the urban population in the region was at 48 percent in 1980, it almost reached 60 percent in 2000 and is expected to reach 70 percent by 2015"
11468,WB-2014-6.txt, The way MENA policy makers will address the challenges posed by climate-induced migration is related to how they will manage to promote an urbanization model that welcomes the contribution of migrants to the development of cities
11469,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Fifth, policy should focus on providing migrants with the portable skills and capabilities they need to fully exploit the adaptation potential of migration"
11470,WB-2014-6.txt, All too often the policy debate focuses on whether migration should be encouraged or not
11471,WB-2014-6.txt, The study has shown that climate-induced migration is already taking place
11472,WB-2014-6.txt, It must therefore be accompanied
11473,WB-2014-6.txt," The provision of education and training can help potential migrants better grasp labor market opportunities both in sending and receiving areas, adapt to new living conditions, and shift more easily among jobs in different sectors"
11474,WB-2014-6.txt," An emphasis on basic and portable skills would be effective regardless of the causes, timing, and destination of the migration decisions involved"
11475,WB-2014-6.txt," And it would benefit not only those that leave, but also those that decide to stay or eventually return"
11476,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Sixth, while dealing with climate-induced migration will require some interventions specifically aimed at migrants, the policy package needed to deal with both climate change and migration is much broader"
11477,WB-2014-6.txt, This is both a challenge and an opportunity
11478,WB-2014-6.txt, This is an opportunity because several levers can be applied to better leverage migration's potential for adaptation and development
11479,WB-2014-6.txt, But this is also a challenge because an integrated policy response will require a level of coordination and commitment that is likely to arise only through broader governance reforms and strong political leadership in MENA countries
11480,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, it is worth investigating how safeguards could play a role in reducing the risk that development initiatives result in negative impacts"
11481,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, could inadvertent increases in the vulnerability of certain groups take place as a by-product of policies and projects that may or may not address climate change directly, such as adaptation initiatives involving resettlement and relocation? Is
there a risk of maladaptation associated with interventions that are founded on unjustified assumptions about future climatic conditions and may thereby increase dependence or pressure on resources threatened by climate change? How to design safeguard mechanisms is a complex issue, if only because policy responses related to migration differ depending on whether one considers sudden-onset climate-related disasters or long-term climate-related environmental changes"
11482,WB-2014-6.txt, But the fact that such safeguard mechanisms are needed is not itself in question
11483,WB-2014-6.txt,"

CHAPTER 1
Quentin Wodon, Nicholas Burger, Audra Grant, and Andrea Liverani

Climate change is a major source of concern in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and migration is often understood as one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions, including extreme weather events"
11484,WB-2014-6.txt," Other coping and adaptation strategies include changing the household's sources of livelihood, and selling assets or taking other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events"
11485,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide, the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of survey and other data"
11486,WB-2014-6.txt," This chapter is based in large part on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen"
11487,WB-2014-6.txt, Household surveys were implemented in two climate-affected areas in each country
11488,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, qualitative focus groups were also implemented in both urban and rural areas"
11489,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, complementary work was completed using existing data sources for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen"
11490,WB-2014-6.txt," The chapter provides a summary of some of the main findings from these various sources of data, focusing on household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events, migration, other household coping and adaptation strategies, and government and community responses"
11491,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, households do perceive important changes in the climate, and many have been affected by extreme weather events with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment"
11492,WB-2014-6.txt," The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse but limited, as are the community and government programs which could help households better cope with and adapt to climate change"
11493,WB-2014-6.txt," In terms of migration, in the areas affected by climate change and weather shocks, the analysis suggests that climate factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climatic conditions continue to deteriorate"
11494,WB-2014-6.txt," While migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed"
11495,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
By the next century, global mean annual temperatures may increase by 3°C to 5°C"
11496,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region this may manifest itself through reduced rainfall, greater seasonal temperature variability, and a rise in the Mediterranean sea level, all of which constitute threats to agricultural production and economic security (Verner 2012)"
11497,WB-2014-6.txt," Agriculture employs about half of the active population in many countries, especially among the poor"
11498,WB-2014-6.txt," Declining precipitation is likely to affect availability and usage of water, causing agricultural productivity to decrease (UNDP 2009; World Bank 2010)"
11499,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate change is also associated with a higher likelihood of extreme temperatures, floods, and droughts, and thereby with health risks as well as risks of substantial displacement (for example, Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009)"
11500,WB-2014-6.txt,"1
Estimates of the number of people likely to be affected by climate change and the extent to which they are likely to be affected are notoriously difficult to provide (Foresight 2011)"
11501,WB-2014-6.txt," But in the MENA region as a whole, some 80­100 million people may be expected to experience water stress by 2025 (Warren et al"
11502,WB-2014-6.txt, By 2050 water availability per capita is expected to decline by 50 percent
11503,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, while the literature is mixed on this issue, aside from the economic impacts climate change may be associated with local conflict as groups compete for access to scarce natural resources (Nordas and Gleditsch 2007; Reuveny 2007)"
11504,WB-2014-6.txt, Some of the evidence in this chapter does point in that direction
11505,WB-2014-6.txt, Climate change also presents unique gender challenges
11506,WB-2014-6.txt," MENA migrants, whether internal or external, are overwhelmingly male, so that women are left to assume the burden of increased workload at the place of origin"
11507,WB-2014-6.txt," And for those women who do migrate, job opportunities tend to be less attractive than those for their male counterparts"
11508,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This study focuses on the link between climate change and migration"
11509,WB-2014-6.txt, Migration is considered as one of several coping and adaptation mechanisms used by households
11510,WB-2014-6.txt, It responds to both push and pull factors
11511,WB-2014-6.txt," Changes in the climate (for example, warming temperatures, heat waves, declining rain fall, and rising water levels) are part of push factors because they lead to a deterioration of the environment"
11512,WB-2014-6.txt," Extreme climactic conditions, such as weather shocks like severe floods or droughts, can lead to temporary migration and displacement"
11513,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate and subsequent environmental degradation decreases agricultural crop production, livestock, or water availability, which adversely affects economic activity"
11514,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast pull factors are those conditions that attract migrants or potential migrants, mainly to urban areas"
11515,WB-2014-6.txt, They also shape and guide human choice
11516,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus the existence of economic opportunities such as employment, well-established community networks that help reduce uncertainty and risk, and available housing may all be variables that pull migrants to a particular area"
11517,WB-2014-6.txt," Schools, health care, electricity, clean water, functioning sewage systems, and other infrastructural features inform decisions as well"
11518,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While the environment generates push factors because of threats to household livelihood (Kniveton et al"
11519,WB-2014-6.txt," 2009), the decision to migrate is filtered through

household characteristics such as socioeconomic status, political context, and migrant networks (Black et al"
11520,WB-2014-6.txt, 2011; Carr 2005)
11521,WB-2014-6.txt, Migration can be permanent or temporary
11522,WB-2014-6.txt," It can be undertaken by a single individual or by an entire household, over a long or short distance"
11523,WB-2014-6.txt," Similarly, environmental impacts can take an acute form, such as flooding or sand storms, or occur gradually via deforestation or changes in temperature and precipitation"
11524,WB-2014-6.txt, These various dimensions render the analysis of migration complex (Kniveton et al
11525,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The complex temporal and spatial dimensions of migration are a challenge for data collection aiming to better understand the causes and consequences of migration"
11526,WB-2014-6.txt," Adaptation assessment requires pre- and post-treatment data, but collecting panel survey data on migration is difficult because migration implies that respondents change their place of residence, making respondent tracking difficult"
11527,WB-2014-6.txt, Only a handful of authors have used panel data in their analysis (Gray and Mueller 2012; Pereira and Caravajal 2008)
11528,WB-2014-6.txt," One alternative involves surveying households about family members who moved to another location (Dillon, Mueller, and Salau 2011)"
11529,WB-2014-6.txt," The caveat with this approach, however, is that the results on migration decisions by some members of the household may not generalize to the migration by the entire household"
11530,WB-2014-6.txt, Households that decide to send only one person to a different location may be different from households that migrate together
11531,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, migration by one or more household members is distinct from migration by the entire household as the latter harder to reverse and requires higher risk tolerance by household members (see Piguet 2010, on alternative methodological approaches)"
11532,WB-2014-6.txt," While some studies use macro-level data on international migration (Beine and Parsons 2012; Reuveny and Moore 2009), this is not a panacea since international migration statistics document only cross-border migration and fail to capture movements of people within country"
11533,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Despite these challenges, the empirical literature seeking to estimate the effect of changing environment has been growing rapidly"
11534,WB-2014-6.txt," This literature suggests that the relationship between migration and environmental change is nuanced, so that careful attention should be paid to the type of climate or weather event and the type of migration"
11535,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, using a gravity model and census data for the Republic of Yemen, Joseph and Wodon (2013, 2014) find that while climate factors do play a role in migration flows between districts, that role is much smaller than the effect of socioeconomic variables"
11536,WB-2014-6.txt," There is also a growing consensus that migration requires a minimum level of resources, and liquidity constraints impede internal migration by the poorest households leading to an ""immobility paradox"" (Foresight 2011; Gray 2009; Halliday 2006; Hammer 2004; Meze-Hausken 2000) which has gender implications"
11537,WB-2014-6.txt,"2
Most micro-level studies measure climate change either by the incidences of extreme weather events or by variation in temperature or rainfall"
11538,WB-2014-6.txt," The evidence is weaker on household responses to incremental environmental degradation such as pollution, soil degradation, or deforestation"
11539,WB-2014-6.txt," Since these factors are incremental, it is harder to isolate their effects on migration from other drivers"
11540,WB-2014-6.txt," Studies by Rappaport and Sachs (2003) and Rappaport (2007) indirectly address the issue of migration as a response to the quality of living by looking at the


weather-related moves in the United States"
11541,WB-2014-6.txt, They suggest that in countries with higher per capita income weather becomes a location amenity that affects choice of residence
11542,WB-2014-6.txt," Further research, however, is needed on how households in developing countries respond to the quality of environment (Findlay 2011; Findlay and Geddes 2011)"
11543,WB-2014-6.txt, Some studies that focus on international migration have also identified environment as a driver
11544,WB-2014-6.txt," Changes in temperature and rainfall have been found to induce out-migration from rural communities in Mexico to the United States (Andersen, Lund, and Verner 2011; Feng, Kruegera, and Oppenheimer 2010; Munshi 2003)"
11545,WB-2014-6.txt," Consistent with the liquidity constraint hypothesis, international migration declines immediately after extreme weather events but internal migration increases because affected households cannot afford long-distance relocation (Beine and Parsons 2012; Findley 1994; Henry and Schoumaker 2004)"
11546,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A few studies have found that formal and informal institutions as well as policies also affect migration"
11547,WB-2014-6.txt," Institutions that make government more responsive to households (for example through public spending) discourage both international and domestic migration in the aftermath of extreme weather events (Andersen, Lund, and Verner 2011; Paul 2005; Reuveny and Moore 2009)"
11548,WB-2014-6.txt, Qualitative studies underscore the importance of informal institutions such as social networks (McLeman and Smit 2006) and intra-household distribution of power (Carr 2005)
11549,WB-2014-6.txt," But migration is often an option of last resort after vulnerable rural populations attempting to cope with new and challenging circumstances have exhausted other options such as eating less, selling assets, or removing children from school"
11550,WB-2014-6.txt," As to remittances, they can be essential for meeting basic food and other needs, especially for households affected by extreme weather events"
11551,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, in terms of a broader conceptual framework that can be used for policy discussions, the Foresight (2011) report makes several important conclusions which are worth reiterating here"
11552,WB-2014-6.txt," First, while environmental change will affect migration, the complexity of the interactions at work in decisions made by individuals and households to migrate are such that it is typically not be feasible to identify ""pure"" environmental migrants"
11553,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, even in the absence of climate change and further environmental degradation, migration away from areas that are environmentally vulnerable today will continue"
11554,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, at the same time, the impact of environmental change on migration will tend to increase in the future"
11555,WB-2014-6.txt," Fourth, planning ahead and managing migration flows to the extent that this can be done will help reduce the risk of humanitarian crises"
11556,WB-2014-6.txt," Fifth, and this is often overlooked, environmental change may make it more difficult for some groups to migrate, because of the cost of migration and the fact that weather shocks often reduce the resources available to people in order to migrate"
11557,WB-2014-6.txt," Sixth, as a result of a lack of migration, some population groups may be trapped in vulnerable areas and these groups deserve attention as well"
11558,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, attempts to prevent or constrain migration are likely to also have their own substantial negative consequences in terms of impoverishment"
11559,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Therefore, the policy challenge consists in finding ways to reduce the negative impact of environmental change on communities while also planning
for migration so that it can be ""transformational"" by providing benefits for populations in both sending and receiving areas"
11560,WB-2014-6.txt," In other words, the Foresight report suggests that climate-induced migration may not be just part of the ""problem"" but can also be part of the solution to various development challenges"
11561,WB-2014-6.txt,"
There is some emphasis in parts of the Foresight report on the risks faced by cities in low-income countries given that while being already vulnerable, these cities continue to attract migrants"
11562,WB-2014-6.txt, The risks faced by vulnerable cities are very serious indeed
11563,WB-2014-6.txt," In this study however, the focus is on how vulnerable rural areas are affected today by climate change and weather shocks, on the impact that these changes and shocks have on households, and on the extent to which they are inducing migration away from these areas"
11564,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, while the Foresight report focuses on the big picture at a global level as it emerges from a wide range of studies, some global and some local, some based on household surveys and other based on climatic and geophysical data, the focus in this study is on somewhat narrow and detailed work using household surveys in a few specific areas affected by climate change and weather shocks"
11565,WB-2014-6.txt,"

11568,WB-2014-6.txt, The same household survey was implemented in two climateaffected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context
11569,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey took approximately two hours to administer and it was designed to elicit household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, self-assessed economic loss, coping strategies such as migration, and awareness of community and government assistance"
11570,WB-2014-6.txt, The surveys were administered by in-country partners to a randomly selected set of 800 households per country
11571,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, focus groups and semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted in the five countries among both rural residents and urban migrants"
11572,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, existing survey and census data from Morocco and the Republic of Yemen were also used"
11573,WB-2014-6.txt,"
It is important to highlight some of the limits of the study"
11574,WB-2014-6.txt," It is sometimes said that ""Climate is what we expect"

11578,WB-2014-6.txt, Climate change is then used to refer to the change in the distribution of rainfall and temperature
11579,WB-2014-6.txt," However, it is more difficult to tell if the weather experienced at any point in time is due to the change in the climate (the overall mean and variance of rainfall and temperature) or is simply part of an existing distribution"
11580,WB-2014-6.txt," As a result, it should be emphasized that this study does not provide new evidence on the direct relationship between climate change and migration, but it does contribute to the evidence on three specific issues: (1) the impact of weather shocks on migration; (2) the impact of perceptions of recent climate change on migration; and (3) the impact of climate patterns (but not directly climate change) on migration"
11581,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Another difficulty relates to the question of whether the observed behavior of households relates to ex-ante or ex-post coping and adaptation"
11582,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the data obtained through the surveys relate to migration following weather shocks, but this migration may result from an ex post adaptation, or an ex ante adaptation of changes in the climate to come, and this cannot be distinguished easily with the data at hand"
11583,WB-2014-6.txt," In some cases, proactive adaptation may be hurting welfare or productivity as households may for example trade-off lower earnings for less risk"
11584,WB-2014-6.txt, Understanding such behaviors requires a deeper understanding of the impacts of climate change and clarity on the nature and effectiveness of the practices that have been developed historically by households and communities as a result of repeated exposures to weather shocks in the past
11585,WB-2014-6.txt, Assuming there is agreement that the climate is changing one may then analyze whether the old coping strategies continue to be equally or less effective as in the past
11586,WB-2014-6.txt," Such an analysis is however beyond the scope of the present report, in part because past data is not available"
11587,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, it must be emphasized that the synthesis provided in this chapter is mostly descriptive and meant to highlight stylized facts"
11588,WB-2014-6.txt, More detailed work relying among others on regression analysis is provided in subsequent chapters
11589,WB-2014-6.txt," It is also important to emphasize that neither the household survey results nor the findings from the qualitative focus groups are meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country"
11590,WB-2014-6.txt," The exception to this rule is for the additional work carried using existing data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen, given that these sources of data were nationally representative (and exhaustive as well in the case of the the Republic of Yemen census)"
11591,WB-2014-6.txt," It must also be recognized again that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses"
11592,WB-2014-6.txt," This is especially the case when working with cross-sectional household surveys, given that shorter-term events may be consistent with, but need not necessarily be reflective of longer-term climate change"
11593,WB-2014-6.txt," These caveats being clear, the rest of the chapter is organized as follows"
11594,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two discusses household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events
11595,WB-2014-6.txt, Section three focuses on migration as a coping mechanisms and income diversification strategy

11598,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
11599,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Perceptions about Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events
Do households believe that changes in climate patterns are taking place in the five countries? While perceptions of climate change need not mean that climate change is actually occurring, they are an important entry point in trying to understand how climate events affect household livelihoods and how households respond to such events"
11600,WB-2014-6.txt, As shown in table 1
11601,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a), where perceptions about changes in climate have been ranked according to the
share of households sharing these perceptions in the five-country sample, this seems to indeed be the case in the five-country sample based on the new household surveys conducted in 2011"
11602,WB-2014-6.txt," More than three fourths of households in the combined sample declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters say that temperatures are higher"
11603,WB-2014-6.txt," Between half and two thirds of households declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent"
11604,WB-2014-6.txt," The changes in climate in turn appear to lead to more diseases in animal and livestock, more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion"
11605,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Some of the extreme weather events often associated with climate change, such as rainstorms and floods, are not perceived as more frequent by a majority
Climate Change and Migration · http://dx"
11606,WB-2014-6.txt,"1596/978-0-8213-9971-2
of households"
11607,WB-2014-6.txt," In some cases, households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler, and that there is actually more rain, but this is often the case only for a minority of households"
11608,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, while there are differences between households as well as between countries (for example, households in Egypt are less likely to perceive a reduction in rainfall), overall the patterns are clear"
11609,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, although this is not shown in table 1"
11610,WB-2014-6.txt,"1, differences between quintiles of well-being in perceptions of climate change tend to be minor--most households share the same perceptions"
11611,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Additional information on perceptions about the climate, weather shocks, and their impact on households is available for Morocco through special modules on climate change and shocks incorporated in a national survey implemented in 2009/10 (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a)"
11612,WB-2014-6.txt," In the survey, as shown in table 1"
11613,WB-2014-6.txt,"2, 28"
11614,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percent of households were involved in agriculture, and among those 92"
11615,WB-2014-6.txt,1 percent declared having been affected by deteriorating climatic conditions in the last five years
11616,WB-2014-6.txt," The most likely shock was a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall, mentioned by 62"
11617,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent of agricultural households
11618,WB-2014-6.txt," In a separate part of the Morocco survey, more than one in five households declared having been affected by a recent weather shock such as a drought or flood, a proportion similar to the product of the share of households in agriculture and the share of those households affected by changing climatic conditions"
11619,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Have households been affected by extreme weather events, and in that case which events had the largest impact? Returning to the five-country sample, when asked if they have been affected by a weather-related disaster in the last five years, almost all households say that this is the case, as shown in table 1"
11620,WB-2014-6.txt,3 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a)
11621,WB-2014-6.txt," When asked which adverse event had the largest negative consequences for them, households cited drought first (30"
11622,WB-2014-6.txt,"9 percent of the overall sample), followed by excessive heat and floods, both affecting about 8 percent of households"
11623,WB-2014-6.txt," There are differences between

Among household in agriculture, share affected by climate-related shock Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions Reduction in stock of livestock due to lower availability of grazing land At least one problem in the last five years

countries though"
11624,WB-2014-6.txt," In Syria, all households declare having been affected by droughts, this being the adverse event considered the most damaging"
11625,WB-2014-6.txt," In Morocco by contrast, floods were the main adverse event affecting households"
11626,WB-2014-6.txt," There are also some differences between households according to their quintile of well-being, but these are less pronounced"
11627,WB-2014-6.txt," The quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of data on consumption"
11628,WB-2014-6.txt," What the data suggest is that households in the poorer quintile are more likely to identify adverse events that affected them the most,
probably because they are more vulnerable to such shocks, as discussed in more detailed below"
11629,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What has been the effect of climate change on households? Households were asked whether in the last five years they suffered from lost income, lost crops, lost livestock or cattle, or less fish caught as a result of weather and environment patterns"
11630,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 1
11631,WB-2014-6.txt,4 summarizes the responses
11632,WB-2014-6.txt," More than half of all respondents said that environmental changes led to a loss of crops, and more than a third reported a loss of income"
11633,WB-2014-6.txt," About a fourth reported a loss of livestock or cattle, and 8"
11634,WB-2014-6.txt,6 percent said that they caught less fish
11635,WB-2014-6.txt," The results differ again between the countries, with especially high frequencies of losses of crops in Syria (remember that virtually all households in the areas surveyed reported suffering from a drought), and lower frequencies in Egypt"
11636,WB-2014-6.txt," As expected, households belonging to lower quintiles of well-being were more likely than better off households to suffer from the various types of losses"
11637,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Again, additional information on the extent to which households are able to cope with weather shocks is available for Morocco through the 2009/10 survey (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a)"
11638,WB-2014-6.txt," It turns out that most of the households that were affected declared that they had not been able to recover from the shock, and this was especially the case among poorer households"
11639,WB-2014-6.txt," According to regression analysis, households in the top quintile of wealth were 20 percentage points more likely to recover from weather shocks than households in the bottom quintile"
11640,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The substantial impact of climate change and extreme weather events on the livelihood of households also emerged from the qualitative focus groups (Grant et al"
11641,WB-2014-6.txt, The majority of respondents were aware of long-term shifts in climate and they attributed declining agriculture fortunes to deteriorating environmental conditions that are caused by changing weather patterns
11642,WB-2014-6.txt," Conditions in rural or ""sending areas"" have become very difficult according to the vast majority

of respondents"
11643,WB-2014-6.txt," In Egypt for example, participants complained of fewer days of rainfall and lower irrigation levels"
11644,WB-2014-6.txt," For key crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results may be devastating: ""Rice is burnt in some seasons, because we cannot find enough water to irrigate it"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia)"
11645,WB-2014-6.txt, They also cited government expropriation of agricultural land as an obstacle to profitable and sustainable agriculture (this problem was not mentioned in other countries)
11646,WB-2014-6.txt," Many former rural residents also mentioned the rising costs of seeds and other agricultural inputs, which may be related in part to climatic conditions"
11647,WB-2014-6.txt,"
For some farmers, the poor quality and quantity of crops means lower prices for their agricultural products, which reduces income"
11648,WB-2014-6.txt, The inability to earn a stable and adequate income for crops makes it difficult to rely solely on agriculture as a source of revenue
11649,WB-2014-6.txt," As a focus group participant from the town of Djelfa in Algeria explained: ""The conditions [for] farming are very poor"
11650,WB-2014-6.txt, There's drought on the one hand and the unavailability of the new equipment and poor methods we use on the other hand

11659,WB-2014-6.txt," Residents therefore sleep during the day because of exhaustion, but with fewer daytime hours dedicated to work and income generation"
11660,WB-2014-6.txt," Agricultural productivity is further weakened by lack of governance and neglect of the sector, ineffective government policies, and corruption"
11661,WB-2014-6.txt," Unfavorable crop prices have led growers to shift from cultivating food crops to qat which is more profitable but requires a great deal of water: ""People there [in villages] work shoulder to shoulder, but the problem lies in agriculture"

To what extent are households migrating away from climate-affected areas, and is climate itself a key push factor in such migration? This is a complex question for which detailed regression analysis is required"

The focus groups also suggest a link between climate and migration, although again the role of socioeconomic factors in determining migration is probably at
least as important (Grant et al"

Table 1"

11820,WB-2014-6.txt," The evidence suggests that worsening climatic conditions, or the perceptions thereof, are clearly a push factor leading to migration away from the affected (mostly rural) areas toward urban centers"
11821,WB-2014-6.txt, It must be noted that in an analysis such as that of Joseph and Wodon (2013a) or Joseph et al
11822,WB-2014-6.txt," (2013a) which is at the level of a country as a whole, the impact of the climate on the
overall patterns of migration tends to be diluted, which helps explain why the effect is qualified as smaller in table 1"
11823,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, in the analysis based on the five countries sample, as well as when looking at weather shocks with the national Morocco survey, the effects are estimated mostly on those affected by these shocks, which also explains why the impacts are larger in affected areas"
11824,WB-2014-6.txt," In those areas, it seems fair to suggest that climatic conditions account for at least 10­20 percent of the current migration flows, and this could increase in the future"

Remittances
Although remittances are not the focus of this study, the last part of the study includes two chapters looking at remittances in the case of the Republic of Yemen"
11826,WB-2014-6.txt," There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms"
11827,WB-2014-6.txt, It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks
11828,WB-2014-6.txt, The first chapter in the last part of the study by Joseph et al
11829,WB-2014-6.txt," (2014a) use a national household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received"
11830,WB-2014-6.txt," The question is whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances"
11831,WB-2014-6.txt, The results suggest that this is not the case in the Republic of Yemen
11832,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the last chapter of the study, Joseph and Wodon (2014b) use matching techniques and the same household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition)"
11833,WB-2014-6.txt, The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate
11834,WB-2014-6.txt, Four main results are obtained
11835,WB-2014-6.txt," First, remittances--which are substantial in the Republic of Yemen-- tend to have positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition"
11836,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances"
11837,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable"
11838,WB-2014-6.txt," Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment"
11839,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and
malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances may be used more for investments, including in the education of children"
11840,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The qualitative work (Grant et al"
11841,WB-2014-6.txt," 2014) also suggests that remittances are important to rural households, especially in rural the Republic of Yemen where there is a long-standing tradition of migration to Saudi Arabia"
11842,WB-2014-6.txt," They allow households to enjoy a reasonably high standard of living, but conversely consequences can be severed in their absence: ""My brother is in Saudi Arabia"

11847,WB-2014-6.txt, Similarly some Algerian rural residents received remittances from relatives who have migrated to France
11848,WB-2014-6.txt," In Egypt, items such as ghee, oil, bread, flour, and sugar are purchased for families in addition to funds being sent directly to homes"
11849,WB-2014-6.txt, The amounts of the transfers sent by migrants back home vary
11850,WB-2014-6.txt," In Morocco remittances ranged from 500 to 1,000 Moroccan dirham per month, depending on the migrant's income"
11851,WB-2014-6.txt, Male respondents tended to remit more than females

11890,WB-2014-6.txt, Another key coping strategy is to diversify income sources
11891,WB-2014-6.txt," One Egyptian woman explained that poor prices turn farmers away from agriculture altogether: ""[Farmers] used to exert earnest effort in the past because the gains were equally profitable, but now it is of no use"
11892,WB-2014-6.txt," Land [requires] a lot of money and the earnings then have to be distributed among many in the family"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt)"
11893,WB-2014-6.txt," Or as a Syrian man explained it: ""When the al-Kabour river was flowing, there was a labor force here and people were able to cultivate their lands, but now"

11895,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet traveling long distances between homes and jobs is cumbersome--and expensive, with a number of respondents in all five countries expressing frustration about the expense of transportation and lack of good roads"
11896,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes"
11897,WB-2014-6.txt," The possibilities included changing production technologies such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; changing crop choices, increasing crop variety, or adopting drought or flood-resistant crops; changing the percentage composition of crops versus livestock; increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides; seeking or increasing off-farm employment; and receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment"
11898,WB-2014-6.txt, Households were also asked whether compared to five years ago they used more stored water or consumed more stored grains and stored animal products
11899,WB-2014-6.txt," They were asked whether they were aware of people moving out of their community as a result of weather or environmental changes, and whether in the last five years people moved into their community"
11900,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, they were asked if in the past five years they experienced conflict over agricultural land or livestock, or water for household use or cultivation due to weather or environmental changes"

The results for those questions are provided in table 1"
11902,WB-2014-6.txt,8 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b)
11903,WB-2014-6.txt," For the sample as a whole, and for most of the alternatives presented in the questionnaire, only a minority of households have implemented any single one of the adaptation strategies"
11904,WB-2014-6.txt," This is explained in part by the fact that many of the alternatives apply mostly to farming households, and not all households are involved in farming (this is evident in the fact that the proportion of households using the various adaptation strategies are higher among households who own land, many of whom farm their land)"
11905,WB-2014-6.txt," Between one in four and one in five households have relied more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought off-farm work, have used more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made a change in their farm production technology"
11906,WB-2014-6.txt, The proportion of those who have received training or changed their crop mix or the varieties they use is at about 15 percent
11907,WB-2014-6.txt, Only 9 percent of households have changed their mix of crops and livestock for their livelihood
11908,WB-2014-6.txt,"
On the other hand, more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of their community due to the climate pressures, and 14 percent declare that some people have moved in, which may at time generate conflict over water, land, or livestock"
11909,WB-2014-6.txt," There are some large differences between countries in the use of adaptation strategies, with households in Egypt and Syria making fewer changes in their modes of livelihood than households in Algeria, the Republic of Yemen, and to some extent Morocco"
11910,WB-2014-6.txt," It also appears that households in the bottom quintiles, which tend to be affected by climate change the most and have limited means to cope with weather shocks and changing conditions, also have made more changes in their livelihood strategies"
11911,WB-2014-6.txt, But this may also be in part because a larger share of those households is involved in farming
11912,WB-2014-6.txt, As before households with international remittances who tend to also be better off tend to rely less on those adaptation strategies than other households
11913,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the absence of local organizations or government agencies that provide assistance (as discussed in the next section), residents tend to rely on each other to cope"
11914,WB-2014-6.txt," As a rural Egyptian male explains it in the focus groups: ""Rural residents are willing to pay [give] half of what we have to help others"

11919,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet solidarity does not always work, and conflicts over natural resources do occur due to changes in climate, as the estimates in table 1"
11920,WB-2014-6.txt,7 show
11921,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Republic of Yemen in particular, rural residents worried in the focus groups that water scarcity has led to conflict over access to wells"
11922,WB-2014-6.txt, One the Republic of Yemeni woman from Hudaydah described a complicated water distribution scheme where water is distributed to certain communities on certain days of the week
11923,WB-2014-6.txt," More generally, for farmers in all five countries, living in impoverished rural areas is not only difficult financially, but it also has negative impacts for health, a concern mentioned by Egyptian rural focus group respondents"
11924,WB-2014-6.txt, Some point out that farmers are increasingly exposed to contaminated water because waste leaks into irrigation canals
11925,WB-2014-6.txt, Others mention being sick with illnesses such as the flu
11926,WB-2014-6.txt," With only limited income at their disposal, many
households cannot afford quality health care and they also often cannot access health facilities because they are not in close proximity"
11927,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Community and Government Programs
In previous sections, information was provided about strategies used by households to cope with weather or environmental changes"
11928,WB-2014-6.txt," What about the role of communities and governments? The survey questionnaire asked whether to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which the household live did the following: planting trees or installing soil protection measures; building banks on rivers, streams or small check banks to reduce flooding; developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation or roads; gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income or livestock; taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts; and taking action to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment"
11929,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Table 1"
11930,WB-2014-6.txt,9 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b) provides the results of the analysis
11931,WB-2014-6.txt," To a large extent, the extent of community involvement to adapt to climate change is limited"
11932,WB-2014-6.txt," While 1 in 5 households declares that the community has planted trees or taken soil erosion measures, and 1 in7 households mentioned


community measures to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment, the other actions that could be taken by communities are mentioned by only 1 in 10 households on average"
11933,WB-2014-6.txt," There are large differences between countries, with households in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen much more likely to mention community initiatives than households in the other three countries"
11934,WB-2014-6.txt," Households in the bottom quintiles (as well as those owning land, although this is not shown in the table) are also more likely to mention initiatives, perhaps because they are more aware of these initiatives as they tend to be affected by weather shocks more"
11935,WB-2014-6.txt," Still, many communities do not seem to implement the types of measures that might help households to cope and adapt"
11936,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Similar questions were asked about the role of governments, albeit with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low"
11937,WB-2014-6.txt, The results are provided in table 1
11938,WB-2014-6.txt," Except for the provision of drinking water which is less related to climate change and shocks, the extent of government involvement in adaptation strategies or safety nets is also limited"
11939,WB-2014-6.txt," For most types of programs, only about 1 in 10 households declare that the government has been active"
11940,WB-2014-6.txt," There are again differences between countries, with households in Algeria, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen more likely to mention government programs than households in Egypt and Morocco"
11941,WB-2014-6.txt," In many but not in all cases households in the bottom three quintiles are more likely to mention initiatives, as was the case for community programs"
11942,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, the extent of government support appears to be limited"
11943,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The fact that community and government programs to help households cope with weather shocks are the exception rather than the rule was also a conclusion of the qualitative work"
11944,WB-2014-6.txt," When asked about government and community programs, focus group respondents said that they were aware of few programs and organizations geared toward assisting the rural poor affected by climate change"
11945,WB-2014-6.txt," Some the Republic of Yemeni residents mentioned the Saleh Organization, but concluded that it only provides temporary help or relief"
11946,WB-2014-6.txt," Rural Algerians knew about government assistance for the agricultural sector, including low interest loans and government extension workers travelling to villages to advise farmers on growing methods"
11947,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet they suggested that the impact of these services was uneven, that isolated locales were far from their reach, and that bureaucracy and corruption made loan acquisition from formal institutions such as banks a lengthy and frustrating process, so much so that most farmers avoid this option altogether"
11948,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the focus groups, rural participants suggested a number of areas where government initiatives could help farmers better adapt to their changing environment (Grant et al"
11949,WB-2014-6.txt, Egyptian respondents mentioned the importance of strengthening agricultural unions

to the Egyptian parliament, so that they were in a much better position to serve agricultural interests"
11951,WB-2014-6.txt, Government provision of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers was also suggested in addition to the provision of loans to purchase machinery or for livestock breeding

Focus Countries and Data

CHAPTER 2
Focus Countries
Nicholas Burger, Audra Grant, Sarah Kups, Yashodhara Rana, and Quentin Wodon

This study aims to be relevant for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as a whole, but it focuses on five countries--Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Yemen, and in many (but not all) cases on specific geographic areas within each of the five countries"
11983,WB-2014-6.txt," After a brief introduction, this chapter outlines the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries"
11984,WB-2014-6.txt," Next, to provide contextual background for the study, the chapter provides an introductory discussion of climate and migration patterns in each of the five countries, and of the policy and institutional context in which discussions on climate change take place"
11985,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction

This study is about the impact of climate change on households, their coping mechanisms and their adaptation strategies, and especially migration"
11986,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration decisions are influenced by a wide range of considerations related to climate change, including the risks of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts and the destruction they may cause, as well as the indirect effects of these and other events, such as lower agricultural yields, lack of water, and the health effects of excess temperatures"
11987,WB-2014-6.txt, Understanding how climate change may impact migration is important to inform not only government and other programs to help households cope with and adapt to climate change but also a wide range of investment decisions which must anticipate future patterns of mobility and settlements
11988,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet to-date relatively little is known about the extent to which households are affected by climate change in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and whether climate change and extreme weather events have a large impact on migration decisions"
11989,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While this study aims to be relevant for the MENA region as a whole, it focuses on five countries--Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen"
11990,WB-2014-6.txt," In that context, the objective of this chapter is twofold"
11991,WB-2014-6.txt," First, the chapter lays out the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries"
11992,WB-2014-6.txt," The aim was to select countries which (1) had a large population to ensure that findings from the study to be illustrative (but not representative) of the relationships
between climate change and migration for a large share of the MENA population; (2) were affected by changes in weather patterns and the environment, especially in terms of the frequency of droughts; (3) represented a wide array of socioeconomic contexts in terms of the countries' levels of development, but with an emphasis on some of the poorer countries where the impact of climate change on households may be largest; (4) had other available data sources such as other household surveys or census data which could be used for complementary analysis"
11993,WB-2014-6.txt,"1
Second, the chapter provides contextual background information on each of the five countries selected for the study"
11994,WB-2014-6.txt," Information is provided first on traditional patterns of international and domestic migration in each country, and next on some of the challenges that the country is facing regarding climate change as well as the institutional framework in which policies related to climate change are being considered, and some of the programs and policies that have been adopted by the government as well as by nongovernmental actors in this area"
11995,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The structure of the chapter is as follows"
11996,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two outlines the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries
11997,WB-2014-6.txt, The next five sections provide contextual background for the study on each of the five focus countries
11998,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
11999,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Criteria for the Choice of Focus Countries
As mentioned in the introduction, four criteria guided the choice of the focus countries in which new data were collected"
12000,WB-2014-6.txt, This section explains and reviews each of these four criteria
12001,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider first population size"
12002,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 2
12003,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 provides population data for the top 10 Arab countries by population size as of July 2012 according to UN estimates, as well as other variables such as population growth"
12004,WB-2014-6.txt," Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco are the three most populated countries in the region, and are part of our sample
of focus countries"
12005,WB-2014-6.txt, The Republic of Yemen and Syria rank seventh and eighth on the list
12006,WB-2014-6.txt, We did not choose Iraq because of the ongoing tensions within the country
12007,WB-2014-6.txt," Sudan was not selected because administratively, it belongs to the SubSaharan Africa region of the World Bank, and not to the Middle East and North Africa Region"
12008,WB-2014-6.txt," Saudi Arabia was not considered because it is much wealthier (and less agrarian) than the other countries, and thereby has much more resources at its disposal to cope with and adapt to climate change"
12009,WB-2014-6.txt, The Islamic Republic of Iran is not listed in table 2
12010,WB-2014-6.txt,1 because it is usually not considered as an Arab country
12011,WB-2014-6.txt,"2
Consider next vulnerability to climate change"
12012,WB-2014-6.txt," As will be clear in subsequent chapters, while some households in the areas of focus of the study have been or are likely to be affected by floods, many more are affected by droughts"
12013,WB-2014-6.txt," Without downplaying the threat of floods, the population affected by droughts is much larger"
12014,WB-2014-6.txt," An analysis of vulnerability to droughts with a special focus on Syria, but with comparative data for other MENA countries was recently conducted by the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands and the United Nations Secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Regional Office for Arab States (ACSAD and ISDR 2011)"
12015,WB-2014-6.txt," On the basis of data on drought frequency and consecutive droughts, the authors estimate that 69"
12016,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percent of the area of the Arab region is not vulnerable to droughts, 14"
12017,WB-2014-6.txt,"45 percent has a low level of vulnerability, 10"
12018,WB-2014-6.txt,98 percent is moderately vulnerable and 5
12019,WB-2014-6.txt,47 percent is highly vulnerable
12020,WB-2014-6.txt,"
As shown in table 2"
12021,WB-2014-6.txt,"2, some of the countries most vulnerable to droughts are Syria (especially the north eastern area), Sudan (southern area), Tunisia (northern area), Algeria (northern area), Morocco (northern area), Somalia (north eastern area), Iraq (north eastern area), Saudi Arabia (north eastern area), and the Republic of Yemen"
12022,WB-2014-6.txt," The focus countries were chosen in part in order to represent conditions in different parts of the region, with Algeria and Morocco being part of the Maghreb, Egypt belonging to the Central Region, Syria located in the Mashreq and the Republic of Yemen located in the Arabian Peninsula"
12023,WB-2014-6.txt," Four of the five countries are among the most vulnerable to droughts in the region, and Egypt was chosen as the largest country in the Central Region and more generally in the Arab world, as discussed earlier"
12024,WB-2014-6.txt," The ACSAD-ISDR study also emphasizes the fact that the drought vulnerable areas tend to be highly populated, with an estimated 54"
12025,WB-2014-6.txt,"69 million people living in areas under high stress from drought vulnerability, and another 91"
12026,WB-2014-6.txt,3 million in areas moderately vulnerable to droughts
12027,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider third levels of socioeconomic development"
12028,WB-2014-6.txt," The principle guiding the choice of countries was to focus on middle- and low-income countries, because these countries tend to have fewer means at their disposal than highincome countries to be able to cope with and adapt to climate change (higherincome countries are also of course affected by climate change, and often in dramatic ways, but their resources make it easier to protect the population from some of the damaging effects of extreme weather shocks)"
12029,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, middle- and lowincome countries are more likely than high-income countries to have net emigration flows internationally"
12030,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Our five focus countries include four middle-income countries--Algeria (with a per capita GDP of US$7,643 in 2011 in US$3), Egypt (per capita GDP US$5,547 in 2011), Syria (per capita GDP of US$4,741 in 2010), and Morocco (per capita GDP of US$4,373 in 2011), but they also include a much poorer country--the Republic of Yemen, with a per capita GDP of only US$2,060 in 2011 (all figures are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators)"
12031,WB-2014-6.txt, Differences in standards of living can also be illustrated through the under-five mortality rate in the various countries
12032,WB-2014-6.txt," The lowest rate is for Syria, at 15"
12033,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 per 1,000 live births, followed by Egypt (21"
12034,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 per 1,000 live births), Morocco (35"
12035,WB-2014-6.txt,"5 per 1,000 live births), and Algeria (36 per 1,000 live births)"
12036,WB-2014-6.txt," The rate is much higher in the Republic of Yemen, at 76"
12037,WB-2014-6.txt,"5 per 1,000 live births"
12038,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider finally the availability of other data sources"
12039,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the work conducted for this study is based on data newly collected, but where feasible we also relied on existing data"
12040,WB-2014-6.txt, Two of the five countries presented an opportunity of using existing data
12041,WB-2014-6.txt," First, Morocco had just implemented a national Household
and Youth Survey between December 2009 and March 2010"
12042,WB-2014-6.txt, The survey included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks
12043,WB-2014-6.txt," Fortunately, just before the survey went to the field, we were able to add a few questions to guide the analysis of climate change and migration"
12044,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, we had at our disposal the latest census and the latest national integrated household survey for the Republic of Yemen"
12045,WB-2014-6.txt," These national datasets for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen made it feasible to conduct analysis for the countries as a whole, thereby complementing the analysis of specific areas within the five countries on the basis of the data collected specifically for this study"
12046,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Overall, the combination of these four considerations together with information on the ongoing dialogue between the World Bank, the Agence Française de Développement, and the various country governments, led to the choice of these five specific countries for the study"
12047,WB-2014-6.txt," In what follows, we provide an introductory discussion of climate change and migration in each of the countries"
12048,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Algerian Context
As mentioned in the introduction, this section and the four sections that follow provide a brief discussion of migration and climate related topics in each of the five countries of focus"
12049,WB-2014-6.txt," Starting with Algeria, consider first international migration"
12050,WB-2014-6.txt, France has long been the primary external destination for Algerian emigrants
12051,WB-2014-6.txt," This continued to be true throughout the 1954­62 War of Independence, and after the war, over 1 million Algerians who had fought on the French side moved to France"
12052,WB-2014-6.txt," In 1973, the Algerian government formally suspended migration to France"
12053,WB-2014-6.txt, The government viewed migration as a form of postcolonial dependence and anticipated sufficient labor demand from the petroleum sector (de Haas 2007)
12054,WB-2014-6.txt," Under this policy, mass labor migration was terminated but family reunification migration continued"
12055,WB-2014-6.txt," Over the last decade, more Algerians, in particular highly skilled individuals, have moved to a more diverse set of destination countries, in particular to Spain (Di Bartolomeo, Jaulin, and Perrin 2010)"
12056,WB-2014-6.txt," In 2002, it was estimated that 1"
12057,WB-2014-6.txt,3 million individuals (4
12058,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent of the population) were living outside of the country
12059,WB-2014-6.txt, Approximately 85 percent of these emigrants were living in France and an additional 8 percent in other European Union countries
12060,WB-2014-6.txt," By 2008, the number of emigrants has fallen to below 900,000 however"
12061,WB-2014-6.txt," Since emigration flows increased over the same time period, this seems to imply that many Algerians chose to return to their home country"
12062,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Algeria has also become a destination for immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa (Sekkai 2008), and special immigrant groups, such as Chinese workers working for Chinese companies (Temlali 2010)"
12063,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, there were around 100,000 foreigners living legally in the country in 2008 and probably three times as many illegal immigrants and refugees, most of them Sahrawis who fled from West Sahara in 1975 and 1976"
12064,WB-2014-6.txt," Probably around 40 percent of foreign migrants see Algeria as their final destination, another 40 percent see it as a transit station on their way to Europe, and the remainder are refugees or immigrants who would
like to return to their home country but currently don't have the means to do so (Temlali 2010)"
12065,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Internal migration within Algeria takes place primarily between rural areas and midsized towns, rather than toward large urban areas (Gubert and Nordman 2009)"
12066,WB-2014-6.txt," In 2010, 66 percent of the population was living in urban areas, up from 60 percent in 2000"
12067,WB-2014-6.txt, Urban areas have been growing at around 2
12068,WB-2014-6.txt,"5 percent over that period, while the number of people living in rural areas has been declining (World Bank 2011)"
12069,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition to voluntary moves, during the Algerian Civil War from 1992 to 2002, at least 1 million Algerians were forced to move within the country"
12070,WB-2014-6.txt, Many of these refugees have not yet been able to return home (EACH-FOR 2008)
12071,WB-2014-6.txt,"
As in other countries, unemployment is a key driver of migration flows, including for the case of highly skilled individuals (de Haas 2007; Di Bartolomeo, Jaulin, and Perrin 2010)"
12072,WB-2014-6.txt, Although unemployment declined from 29
12073,WB-2014-6.txt,3 percent in 1999 to 10
12074,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 percent in 2009, rates among under-30-year-olds are typically twice as high as the national and even higher among young highly educated individuals (Ministry of Territorial Management and Environment [MATE] 2010)"
12075,WB-2014-6.txt," It is worth noting, however, that unemployment is on average higher among Algerianborn individuals residing abroad than in Algeria itself (European Commission 2010)"
12076,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider next the question of environmental degradation and climate change"
12077,WB-2014-6.txt," The Algerian territory encompasses three main geographic regions: the Tell in the north, the high planes in the center, and the Sahara in the South of the country"
12078,WB-2014-6.txt," The littoral region of the north is the most densely populated, with 63 percent of the population on four percent of the territory"
12079,WB-2014-6.txt," One tenth of the population lives in the Sahara, which represents 85 percent of the territory"
12080,WB-2014-6.txt," The majority of arable land (3 percent of the territory) as well as the majority of industry are located in the coastal region, while the region of the High Plains dominated by semi-nomadic pastoral cultures"
12081,WB-2014-6.txt," The coast and the Tellian Atlas are in a temperate climate zone, with warm summers and mild and rainy winters; the High Plaines and the Saharian Atlas have an arid climate, with low and irregular rainfall, cold winters, and very hot summers; and the Sahara has a desert climate (MATE 2010)"
12082,WB-2014-6.txt, Slow-onset environmental degradation is an issue throughout Algeria and the country is already subjected to water stress
12083,WB-2014-6.txt," Mean annual precipitation ranges from 800 to 1,000 millimeters in the East of the Tellian Atlas to 20­150 millimeters in the Sahara"
12084,WB-2014-6.txt," Since 1975, precipitation has gradually decreased, with currently only 600 cubic meters of fresh water per habitant and year, a level below the U"
12085,WB-2014-6.txt," defined scarcity threshold of 1,000 cubic meters (MATE 2010)"
12086,WB-2014-6.txt," Based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data and World Population Prospects data, Fargues (2008) estimates that this amount will not drastically decrease until 2030, but it may decline after that"
12087,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Apart from water scarcity, another environmental problem affecting Algerian agriculture is soil erosion and desertification"
12088,WB-2014-6.txt, In the Algerian steppes 3
12089,WB-2014-6.txt,"5 percent of the land is already subject to desertification or being irreparably damaged, and more than 50 percent of the territory is either highly sensitive or sensitive to

desertification (MATE 2010)"
12090,WB-2014-6.txt," For the future, Cline (2007) estimates shortfalls in agricultural yields by 2080 ranging between 28 percent and 36 percent versus the baseline of 2003, while Rousset and Arrus (2006, cited in Gubert and Nordman 2009) predict that by 2020, agricultural yields could decrease from 5 percent to 14 percent as a result of environmental problems exacerbated by climate change"
12091,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Extreme climate events are also frequent, with parts of the northern region of the country highly vulnerable to droughts (such as the several-year long drought of the early 1990s), cold waves (January 2005), flash floods (possibly associated with mud slides) due to heavy rainfall (in November 2001, October 2002, and October 2008), and heat waves (summer 2003)"
12092,WB-2014-6.txt, The consequences of these events range from large harvest losses and destruction of homes to deaths
12093,WB-2014-6.txt," For instance, in November 2001 the municipality of Bal El Oud in the region of Algier registered a rainfall of 290 millimeters, 40 percent of the mean annual precipitation, in less than 17 hours"
12094,WB-2014-6.txt," In the wake of this event, in this municipality alone, 712 people died, 115 had disappeared, 311 were injured, and 1,454 families lost their home"
12095,WB-2014-6.txt," Since 1975, both droughts and flooding have become more common, and there are concerns that this trend will continue in the future (MATE 2010)"
12096,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, forest fires, which are only partly a result from the climate, have become less common and severe since 2001, due in part to increased surveillance and the implementation of an early warning and intervention system (MATE 2010)"
12097,WB-2014-6.txt, Despite being predicted to have the highest rise in sea levels in North Africa by 2030 (NIC 2009) less than 1 percent of the population may be affected by sea level rises (Sowers and Weinthal 2010)
12098,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider finally the link between environmental degradation, climate change, and migration"
12099,WB-2014-6.txt," To our knowledge, no studies are available on how past environmental shocks have affected migratory movements in Algeria, or how they may be related in the future"
12100,WB-2014-6.txt," A conference hosted by the National Intelligence Council concluded that Algeria is less economically vulnerable to climate change because a large percentage of its GDP (30 percent) is derived from oil and natural gas and because agriculture and tourism play a limited role for the country's economy (NIC 2009), both in terms of GDP and labor force share (only 14 percent of the labor force is employed in the agricultural sector according to the CIA 2011)"
12101,WB-2014-6.txt, This may suggest that climate-induced out-migration will not drastically increase due to climate stress
12102,WB-2014-6.txt," However, Algeria already has to import 45 percent of its food, a percentage that may increase in the future due to increasing desertification, soil erosion, and water shortages, so that climate change may exacerbate the food security situation, leading to refugee flows (Brown and Crawford 2009)"
12103,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In terms of the policy framework, Algeria has been party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) since 1993, and it ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2005 as a non-Annex I party country"
12104,WB-2014-6.txt," In 1996, Algeria also ratified the Convention on the Fight against Desertification"

Introduction
Having explained the rationale for the choice of focus countries for this study and having provided general background on each of the five countries in c hapter 2, this chapter documents the process followed and the choices made for new data collection in the five focus countries--Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen"
12399,WB-2014-6.txt," Documenting these choices is important because much of the effort under this study in terms of staff time and study costs consisted in collecting and analyzing new data in the five countries--that is, household surveys and qualitative focus groups as well as in-depth household interviews and key informants interviews"
12400,WB-2014-6.txt," But documenting these choices is also important to clarify what the study can and cannot do-- what it can inform us about, but also what it cannot inform us about given the data's limits in terms of representativeness as well as the types of questions asked and to whom"
12401,WB-2014-6.txt,"
We first describe briefly the nature of the household survey questionnaire, and especially the questions in the survey what it enables us to do, as well as some of its limits"
12402,WB-2014-6.txt," In each of the five focus countries the same household survey
was implemented, with only minor adaptations to take into account country characteristics"
12403,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections, many of which were designed to gather background information on household members"
12404,WB-2014-6.txt," But the three chapters that have been written in this study using the household surveys focus on the questions related to household perceptions of climate change, coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, and finally both temporary and permanent migration"
12405,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Next, we explain how the household survey sites were selected in each of the five countries and how the survey samples were constructed in each subarea"
12406,WB-2014-6.txt, We also provide a few comments on weights and on some of the challenges encountered during survey implementation
12407,WB-2014-6.txt, Data collection was not easy
12408,WB-2014-6.txt," In Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, the quantitative and qualitative fieldwork was interrupted by the 2011 Arab Spring events, causing delays of weeks and, in some cases months, with frequent interruptions in fieldwork once the data gathering resumed"
12409,WB-2014-6.txt," While these events did not appear to affect responses in the survey, the teams implementing the survey had to be flexible in order to adapt"
12410,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, in the Republic of Yemen interviewers faced some intimidation and threats to their physical security, which caused further delays in data collection there"
12411,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally we provide background on the objectives of the qualitative data collection, as well as the process followed and techniques used, such as probing on specific questions"
12412,WB-2014-6.txt," As was the case for the survey data collection, data collection was challenging in some countries"
12413,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Republic of Yemen the deteriorating security conditions made focus group recruitment very difficult, which led to a switch from focus groups to in-depth interviews for that country"
12414,WB-2014-6.txt," In Algeria, focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion"
12415,WB-2014-6.txt," Time constraints and worries about the spread of Arab Spring dynamics prevented sustained efforts at focus groups recruitment, so that in that country as well the team opted for indepth interviews"
12416,WB-2014-6.txt," We also discuss the approach used for interviews with key informants, who included government officials as well as researchers and representatives of nongovernmental and international organizations"
12417,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The structure of the chapter follows closely the above discussion"
12418,WB-2014-6.txt," After explaining some of the characteristics of the household survey questionnaire in section two, section three is devoted to the process followed for collecting the household survey data"
12419,WB-2014-6.txt," Section four discusses the qualitative data collection through focus groups in Egypt, Morocco, and Syria, and in-depth interviews in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as well as interviews with key informants"
12420,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
12421,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Household Survey Questionnaire
In each of the five focus countries the same household survey was implemented, with only minor adaptations to take into account country characteristics"
12422,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections, many of which were designed to gather background information on household members, including on
demographics, education, health, and occupation, as well as household wellbeing"
12423,WB-2014-6.txt, Three chapters have been written in this study using the household surveys conducted in the five countries
12424,WB-2014-6.txt," This section briefly describes the data used in each of the three chapters, and the types of questions in the survey which make this analysis feasible"
12425,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Chapter 4 focuses on household perceptions of extreme weather events and climate change, and the impact of adverse events on their livelihood"
12426,WB-2014-6.txt, The analysis is based on three main questions
12427,WB-2014-6.txt," First, households are asked if they have noticed any changes in weather patterns in the last five years, with the potential changes identified in the questionnaire including more erratic rainfall, less or more rain, more frequent droughts, floods, or sandstorms, and changes in temperatures, among others"
12428,WB-2014-6.txt," Next household are asked if, again compared to five years ago, they have noticed changes in their environment--these would include deforestation, livestock losses, crop failures, water pollution, less fertile land, and so on"
12429,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, households are asked if they experienced losses of crops, income, livestock, or fish as a result of changes in weather patterns"
12430,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Chapter 6 looks at the ways through which households cope with the impact of adverse weather events, and how they adapt to changes in the climate and their environment"
12431,WB-2014-6.txt," On coping, households who declare that they have experienced a loss of crops, income, livestock, or fish due to weather shocks or changes in the environment are asked if they used the following coping strategies: (1) Selling or pawning livestock; (2) Selling or pawning assets other than livestock, such as land or jewelry; (3) Withdrawing children from school; (4) Using their savings; and finally (5) Asking for a loan"
12432,WB-2014-6.txt, Households who did not experience a loss linked to an adverse weather events are asked whether they would rely on the same coping mechanisms in case they would experience such a loss
12433,WB-2014-6.txt," On adaptation, households are asked whether they have taken specific actions to adapt to changing conditions"
12434,WB-2014-6.txt," Many different actions are listed in the questionnaire, including changing in the timing of planting, changing the source of water used, drilling boreholes, changing production technologies or crop choices, increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides, seeking or increasing off-farm employment, and so on"
12435,WB-2014-6.txt," Similar questions are asked about the community level response to climate change, and about the availability of government programs that could help households cope with and adapt to climate change"
12436,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, chapter 7 looks at the relationship between household perceptions of climate change and whether household members have migrated either temporarily (this is referred to as resident migration because the member still resides in the household), or permanently (this is referred to as nonresident migration)"
12437,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis is made possible through information asked about migration not only among current household members, but also among those who used to live in the household and have left permanently"
12438,WB-2014-6.txt, There are however limits to the analysis that can be conducted with such data
12439,WB-2014-6.txt," First, because the surveys were implemented in sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we do not record information on the migration of entire households--we only record the migration of household members"
12440,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, it is difficult to distinguish the
separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses"
12441,WB-2014-6.txt," It could be that household perceptions of climate change are wrong--for example, even if households declare that rainfalls are becoming more erratic, this may not be the case in reality"
12442,WB-2014-6.txt," At the same time, one could argue that decisions such as that of migrating are influenced at least as much by the perceptions of households of the reality as by the reality itself"
12443,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, questions in the survey about the reasons for migration provide a way of checking whether the estimates of the impact of perceptions on migration in the regression analysis are of a reasonable order of magnitude"
12444,WB-2014-6.txt,"
It must be emphasized that because the surveys are not nationally representative and were implemented only in two sending areas affected by extreme weather events, as discussed in the next section, we are not able to provide estimates of migration by entire households away from the sending areas--we only record the migration of household members"
12445,WB-2014-6.txt,"
To mitigate this weakness, we also conducted work with nationally representative data"
12446,WB-2014-6.txt," For Morocco, we used the nationally representative Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented between December 2009 and March 2010"
12447,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the questionnaire of that survey focuses on issues critical to youth, such as the obstacles they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation"
12448,WB-2014-6.txt, But the questionnaire also included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks
12449,WB-2014-6.txt," Being aware that the survey would be implemented, we were able to add additional questions on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions"
12450,WB-2014-6.txt," Those data are then used for two chapters in the study on, respectively, the ability of households to cope with weather and other shocks (chapter 5), and the migration decisions of household members (chapter 10)"
12451,WB-2014-6.txt, For the Republic of Yemen we used data from the latest census and the latest national integrated household survey to conduct additional analysis of migration patterns
12452,WB-2014-6.txt, The census data were used together with other data (including climatic data) to analyze the determinants of migration rates between districts (chapter 9)
12453,WB-2014-6.txt," The national household survey was used to analyze who benefits from remittances from international and domestic migrants, and what impact those remittances have on the welfare and human development indicators of the households who receive them, and whether this impact depends on where the beneficiary households live (chapters 11 and 12)"
12454,WB-2014-6.txt," The fact that we are able to rely on national data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen helps in placing some of the findings from the new household surveys in a broader context, so that the use of the two types of data complement each other"
12455,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Household Survey Data Collection Survey Sites Selection In each of the five countries the same household survey was implemented in two predominantly rural areas"
12456,WB-2014-6.txt," These two areas were located in regions that are
considered to be vulnerable to climate-induced environmental degradation in the agricultural sector and are also areas that have produced significant out-migration internal to the countries"
12457,WB-2014-6.txt," In other words, the regions were chosen based on existing environmental conditions and on their contribution to internal migration patterns"
12458,WB-2014-6.txt, The majority of the areas have been subjected to long-term drought and water scarcity or incidence of flooding
12459,WB-2014-6.txt," While there is ongoing debate regarding whether the sources of climate change are caused by human actions or by natural climatic factors, the selection of the areas was meant to reflect the latter"
12460,WB-2014-6.txt," In practice, we relied for the selection of the areas on recommendations from climate change and environment experts in the respective countries, population and migration experts, ministry officials, and existing information from a wide variety of sources on climate and migration trends in each country"
12461,WB-2014-6.txt, The remoteness of the areas and security risks also influenced survey site selection
12462,WB-2014-6.txt, Official approval from ministries in each country was obtained to conduct the survey in each survey site
12463,WB-2014-6.txt, The sample size in each area was 400 households for a total of 800 households in each of the five countries
12464,WB-2014-6.txt,"

In Algeria, two sites were selected"
12465,WB-2014-6.txt," M'Sila is located in the Steppe region and has been classified by the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and the National Centre for Spatial Techniques as an area that is ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification"
12466,WB-2014-6.txt," Approximately, 62 percent of the region has been designated as such"
12467,WB-2014-6.txt," Djelfa is also located in the Steppe zone and has similarly been designated as ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification"
12468,WB-2014-6.txt," In that region, approximately 500,000 hectares of land are in the process of desertification and more than seven million hectares are under threat of desertification"
12469,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Egypt, the first area chosen area was Dakhalia in the Northeast"
12470,WB-2014-6.txt, Experts at the Cairo College for Engineering indicate that water consumption has increased 17 percent owed to hotter and longer summers there
12471,WB-2014-6.txt," In the governorate of Dakhalia, approximately 11,000 hectares of land in 2010 were no longer viable as a result of poor weather conditions, which has caused diminished water supply for agriculture"
12472,WB-2014-6.txt, Farmers staged regular protests outside of the governor's office demanding initiative to improve availability of water
12473,WB-2014-6.txt," The second region is Sharqia, also in the Northeast"
12474,WB-2014-6.txt, Similar water scarcity has damaged rice farms causing farmers to use sewage water for irrigation purposes
12475,WB-2014-6.txt," The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics reports that water resources in Egypt will decline by 15 billion cubic meters by 2017 in these and other areas throughout the country, a significant decrease from the requirement of 86"
12476,WB-2014-6.txt,2 billion
12477,WB-2014-6.txt," Each of
the above areas is a supplier of migrants to other areas within Egypt, mostly to urban areas, such as Cairo, a major destination for rural migrants who seek to escape poverty"
12478,WB-2014-6.txt, These survey areas were approved by officials and researchers associated with the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency
12479,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Morocco, the first site was Chichaoua in the Plains Region"
12480,WB-2014-6.txt, Chichaoua Province has been affected by drought over recent decades
12481,WB-2014-6.txt, The pattern has been accompanied by severe drought events
12482,WB-2014-6.txt, The second region is Al-Gharb in the Northwest
12483,WB-2014-6.txt, The Al-Gharb plain is Morocco's second largest agricultural producing region
12484,WB-2014-6.txt," In 2009, Al-Gharb accounted for roughly 35 percent of the country's cereal acreage"
12485,WB-2014-6.txt, Al-Gharb has been severely affected by flash flooding from the Sebou River--events exacerbated by heavy snowfall and rains--which began in 2009
12486,WB-2014-6.txt, Thousands were displaced amid loss of homes and shelter and significant damage to infrastructure and agricultural production
12487,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet, Gharb also suffers from cycles of lack of rainfall"
12488,WB-2014-6.txt," In 2011, for example, rainfall decreased by 14 percent"
12489,WB-2014-6.txt," The area was recommended by Moroccan government officials and is an outlier among the survey sites, an area that has been affected by short-term weather events in the form of a natural disaster"
12490,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Syria, the first area is Al-Hassakeh in the North"
12491,WB-2014-6.txt, The region has been afflicted by drought and land degradation over a long period
12492,WB-2014-6.txt, The Qamishle and al-Shadaddi districts have been particularly affected
12493,WB-2014-6.txt, Tens of thousands of Syrians have been displaced from al-Hassakeh as a result of severe drought

Sample Design and Weights For each country, the target was to implement the survey with a sample of 800 households"

12570,WB-2014-6.txt," The primary reasons for selecting the 15 villages in Taiz and 11 villages in Hudayda were the distribution of population, community variety, local knowledge, and the observed degree of environmental degradation"
12571,WB-2014-6.txt, The most critical areas with respect to environmental problems were chosen in both governorates
12572,WB-2014-6.txt, The total sample size within each governorate was allocated across the chosen villages on the basis of number of households on the basis of data produced by the the Republic of Yemen Central Statistical Organization
12573,WB-2014-6.txt, Each village was divided into different sectors (or neighborhoods) and interviews were divided equally among the two sectors
12574,WB-2014-6.txt," In each

sector the interviewers contacted every third household by location to achieve quasi randomness"
12575,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Household sampling weights are usually defined as the inverse of the probability of selection of a household in a sample"
12576,WB-2014-6.txt," In general, the probability of selection of a household consists of two components"
12577,WB-2014-6.txt," The first component can be


denoted as P(district), the probability with which a district or other subarea is selected within a prefecture or governorate"
12578,WB-2014-6.txt," The second component is the probability of selection of a household within a district, P(household|District)"
12579,WB-2014-6.txt," With a random selection of households within a district, this is the ratio of the number of interviews competed in a district and the population size of the district"
12580,WB-2014-6.txt, The probability for a household to be selected is then P(Selection)=P(district)× P(household|District) and the sampling weight is 1/P(Selection)
12581,WB-2014-6.txt, This is the approach used for assigning households weights in Algeria
12582,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Morocco, given that villages were randomly selected from each stratum, they have an equal probability of selection"
12583,WB-2014-6.txt," This then simplifies the probability of selection of households, which is simply the ratio of the total number of household interviewed in a stratum and the size of the stratum"
12584,WB-2014-6.txt," That is, P(Selection) = Number of interviews/Number of families in an area, with again the sampling weight defined as the inverse of the probability of selection"
12585,WB-2014-6.txt," In Syria, the sample was essentially self-weighted (equal probability of selection for all households), given that the areas within districts were selected randomly, and so were the households within districts"
12586,WB-2014-6.txt," In Egypt, due to the nonrandom selection of villages, it is not advisable to produce weights (within villages, households were selected randomly)"
12587,WB-2014-6.txt," Similarly, due to the systematic selection of villages within governorates in the Republic of Yemen, sample weights are also not provided (again, within villages households were selected randomly, but villages themselves were not)"

12601,WB-2014-6.txt, Household refusals to participate in the field were primarily due to the length of the questionnaire and the personal nature of questions
12602,WB-2014-6.txt, A total of 99 households refused to participate and 133 people showed reservations when asked questions on personal life details
12603,WB-2014-6.txt," The supervisors for the data collection team were responsible for quality control, which included accompanying interviewers to household visits (20 percent of interviews), checking a subsample of questionnaires for accuracy (20 percent of interviews), and telephone call backs (35 percent of interviews)"
12604,WB-2014-6.txt, Double data entry was conducted for 15 percent of the questionnaires as an additional test
12605,WB-2014-6.txt," Some problems we reencountered during interviews, including respondents who were observed to give any answer just to finish the interview, respondents that did not take the survey seriously, and interruptions from other people in the household during the interview"

Qualitative Data Collection
Focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews were also implemented in the five countries for this study"
12627,WB-2014-6.txt, Focus groups are a set of individuals that are selected and assembled to discuss a given topic of research from the perspective of personal experience
12628,WB-2014-6.txt, The conduct of focus groups is based on the assumption that: participants have a specific experience of or opinions about the topic under investigation
12629,WB-2014-6.txt, An explicit interview guide is used and the varied experiences of participants are explored in relation to a set of predetermined research questions
12630,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Focus group research draws upon respondents' attitudes, sentiments, beliefs, experiences and reactions in ways that are not feasible using other methods--for example, observation, one-to-one interviewing, or survey questionnaires"
12631,WB-2014-6.txt," These attitudes, feelings and beliefs may be partially independent of the group's social setting, but the social and interactive environment provided by a focus group can help respondents articulate and further reflect upon views"
12632,WB-2014-6.txt," Compared to individual interviews, which target individual attitudes and impressions, focus groups elicit an array of views and psychological processes in a group context"
12633,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The original intent was to conduct focus groups in the five countries"
12634,WB-2014-6.txt," But as mentioned in the introduction, lack of security in the Republic of Yemen made focus group recruitment difficult, and in n Algeria, focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion"
12635,WB-2014-6.txt," In both countries, this led to a shift toward semistructured in-depth interviews which provide similarly rich and textured information"
12636,WB-2014-6.txt, In such interviews individuals engage in a discussion themselves and are posed open-ended questions not unlike the question-answer process in a focus group setting
12637,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Focus groups and in-depth interviews either can be used at the preliminary stages of a study to inform other aspects of research or may be used to confirm findings produced from other research methods, such as following a quantitative survey"
12638,WB-2014-6.txt," In such a scenario, focus groups are useful as a confirmatory method that may valid certain hypotheses or assumptions about attitudes, emotional processes, or understandings of concepts"
12639,WB-2014-6.txt," In other words, they can help explain survey findings"
12640,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet as with any method, focus groups and in-depth interviews are not without their limitations"
12641,WB-2014-6.txt," First, neither method permits sweeping generalizations across entire populations"
12642,WB-2014-6.txt, This is because focus group samples are not representative of large populations
12643,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the moderator risks the loss of control over the direction and tenor of focus group discussion"
12644,WB-2014-6.txt, Group interactions and dynamics are strongly influenced by the dialogue created by participants
12645,WB-2014-6.txt," Consequently, the moderator may have difficulty controlling the flow of discussion"
12646,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, and related to the previous limitation, is the difficulty in drawing out and isolating individual viewpoints"
12647,WB-2014-6.txt," Since focus group and interview participants speak in specific contexts, and within specific cultures, it may be difficult to clearly identify an individual attitude"
12648,WB-2014-6.txt," Still, both approaches can also be used as an evaluative tool to assess reactions to policies and events and are also useful as points of departure for future research through generating hypotheses"
12649,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The qualitative fieldwork was conducted among adults 18 years of age and older in each country between November 2010 and February 2012"
12650,WB-2014-6.txt," Implementation dates varied by country due to Arab Spring protests and government collapse which interrupted fieldwork in Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, starting in January 2011"
12651,WB-2014-6.txt," Although the results do not appear to be seriously affected, there is some mention of concern about the security situation related to Arab Spring events among Egyptian focus group respondents"
12652,WB-2014-6.txt," Results are based on the conduct of seven focus groups in Morocco, Egypt, and Syria, with each group comprising six to eight participants: four focus groups among urban migrants, who have relocated internally from rural areas; and three focus groups in each rural area among rural residents"
12653,WB-2014-6.txt, The structure of the focus groups was determined by assumptions and hypotheses believed to be critical in informing respondent attitudes and their adaption strategies
12654,WB-2014-6.txt," The rural and urban groups were comprised of both men and women, and the groups were divided by age, gender and socioeconomic status"
12655,WB-2014-6.txt," In Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as already mentioned, semi-structured interviews were conducted instead"
12656,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In order to accurately capture variation in attitudes, respondents were recruited from select areas referred to as rural or ""sending areas"" and urban or ""receiving areas"
12657,WB-2014-6.txt,""" Rural or ""sending areas"" are often the source of internal migrants moving to cities, and were selected for this study based on their long-term physical exposure to environmental degradation and declining agriculture, as well as corollary trends of rural outmigration to other areas internal to countries"
12658,WB-2014-6.txt, The rural areas were also the sites of household surveys mentioned in the previous section
12659,WB-2014-6.txt," In other words, the rural focus group sites in Algeria (M'Sila), Morocco (Lamzoudia), Egypt (Dakhalia), Syria (al-Hassakeh), and the Republic of Yemen (Hudaydah) were chosen based on the extent of documented environmental degradation and

12662,WB-2014-6.txt, These were selected based on trends of rural to urban migration
12663,WB-2014-6.txt," In most cases, these areas were among the countries' largest, most populous cities"
12664,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, in Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, the urban focus group sites were Algiers, Casablanca, Cairo, Damascus, and Sanaa"

12667,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Respondents were randomly recruited door-to-door using a screening questionnaire that filtered for select demographic characteristics"
12668,WB-2014-6.txt," For receiving areas, involvement in agricultural activity prior to migrating was a critical selection criterion for those recruited in urban neighborhoods"
12669,WB-2014-6.txt," Migrants had to have come from households that relied solely on agriculture as the main source of income, and relocated to urban areas due to unfavorable agricultural conditions in their homes of origin within the last 10 years"
12670,WB-2014-6.txt, All rural respondents in sending areas were selected based on the primacy of agriculture as the main source of economic activity
12671,WB-2014-6.txt, Respondents for in-depth interviews were also recruited similarly to focus group respondents
12672,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Discussions in focus groups and in-depth interviews in urban areas were organized around nine questions, with probing for specific aspects or sub-question within each of the main nine question"
12673,WB-2014-6.txt," The nine questions were as follows: (1) What would you say the biggest problem facing your household these days?; (2) As you know, some people who live in this area have relocated from other places"

Conclusion
New data collection on perceptions of climate change and migration decisions was a key component of this study"

12689,WB-2014-6.txt," The discussion of the data collection for the household surveys included a review of key questions in the survey questionnaire, as well as the sampling design and some of the challenges encountered during survey implementation"
12690,WB-2014-6.txt," For qualitative data collection, we discussed the approach used in the various countries and its rationale, as well as the main questions that were asked not only in focus groups, but also in in-depth interviews, and in the interviews with key informants"
12691,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Perhaps the most important point to emphasize again in concluding this chapter is the fact that neither the household surveys nor the focus groups and the other qualitative data are representative of the countries as a whole in which they were implemented, since they are only representative (or quasi-representative in some cases) of the areas selected for fieldwork"
12692,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet the data are illustrative of the conditions prevailing in the five countries, and since these countries account for a large share of the population in the region, they are also illustrative for the region as a whole, or at least as much as they could be given constraints in the size of the samples"

CHAPTER 4
Perceptions of Climate Change, Weather Shocks, and Impacts on Households
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

What are the perceptions of households in the Middle East and North Africa Region regarding changes in the climate of the areas where they live? To what extent are households affected by extreme weather events such as droughts or floods? And who tends to suffer the most from such events when they occur? This chapter suggests answers to these questions on the basis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen"
12694,WB-2014-6.txt, The household surveys were implemented in two climate affected areas in each country
12695,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, households in these areas do perceive important changes in the climate, for example with droughts becoming more frequent"
12696,WB-2014-6.txt," While many households declare being affected by extreme weather events, with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment, this is especially the case of the poor who appear to suffer the most from extreme weather events"
12697,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
Climate change is expected to result in an increase in global temperatures by 3°C to 5°C in this century, as well as in a reduction in rainfall and greater seasonal temperature and rainfall variability in many areas"
12698,WB-2014-6.txt," Higher sea levels are also a threat to many areas, including in the MENA region where a large share of its population is located in low lying areas"
12699,WB-2014-6.txt," With agriculture remaining essential for livelihood in the region, and existing conditions in terms of water s carcity being already precarious in many areas, climate change represents a significant concern for households (Verner 2012; see also World Bank 2010 and Foresight 2011)"
12700,WB-2014-6.txt," Expectations are that extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent, which has implications for coping and adaptation mechanisms, as well as internal and international migration (for example, UNDP 2009; World Bank 2010; Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009)"
12701,WB-2014-6.txt," For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
12702,WB-2014-6.txt," (2014) and chapter

2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al"
12703,WB-2014-6.txt," (2014a), both in this study"
12704,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This chapter focuses on household perceptions regarding climate change, the impact of extreme weather events, and the ways through which households cope with such events"
12705,WB-2014-6.txt," More specifically, the chapter looks at four main questions: (1) What are the perceptions of households in the Middle East and North Africa Region regarding changes in the climate of the areas where they live?; (2) To what extent are households affected by extreme weather events such as droughts or floods and who tends to suffer the most from such events when they occur?; and (3) How do households cope with extreme weather events? The chapter suggests answers to these questions on the basis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen (see Burger et al"
12706,WB-2014-6.txt," 2014a, 2014b)"
12707,WB-2014-6.txt, The household surveys were implemented in two climate affected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context
12708,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey took approximately two hours to administer and it was designed to elicit household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, self-assessed economic loss, and coping strategies, among others"
12709,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Overall, households do perceive important negative changes in the climate, for example with droughts becoming more frequent, or rainfall more erratic"
12710,WB-2014-6.txt," While many households declare being affected by extreme weather events, with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment, this is especially the case of the poor who appear to suffer the most"
12711,WB-2014-6.txt," As far as coping mechanisms are concerned, again the poor ten do have fewer options than better off households"
12712,WB-2014-6.txt," While none of the findings are unexpected, they do confirm that the poor tend to be most affected by extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change, while they also have fewer means to cope with such events"
12713,WB-2014-6.txt," It must however be emphasized that the household survey results are not meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country"
12714,WB-2014-6.txt," It must also be recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses"
12715,WB-2014-6.txt," This is especially the case when working with cross-sectional household surveys given that shorter-term events may be consistent with, but need not necessarily be reflective of longer-term climate change"
12716,WB-2014-6.txt,"
These caveats being stated, the chapter is organized as follows"
12717,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two introduces the data used for the analysis
12718,WB-2014-6.txt, Section three discusses household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events
12719,WB-2014-6.txt, Section four provides evidence on the impact of changes in weather patterns and the environment
12720,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
12721,WB-2014-6.txt,"

instrument was used in all countries with minor adjustments for country context"
12722,WB-2014-6.txt," In each country, 800 households were interviewed"
12723,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey questionnaire was designed by a World Bank team, and the surveys were implemented in the five countries by Rand in collaboration with local partners"
12724,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Algeria, the survey was implemented in the prefectures of Djelfa and M'sila"
12725,WB-2014-6.txt," Djelfa is in the north-central part of Algeria, while M'Sila is in the northern part"
12726,WB-2014-6.txt, The sites were selected based on reported high sensitivity to desertification and with input from the Algerian government
12727,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and National Center for Spatial Techniques, 62 percent of M'Sila province is classified as ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification"
12728,WB-2014-6.txt, The sample size of 800 families was equally split across the two prefectures
12729,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Egypt, we selected two Governorates: Dakhalia and Sharqia"
12730,WB-2014-6.txt," Dakhalia is north-east of Cairo, while Sharqia is in the northern part of the country"
12731,WB-2014-6.txt, The total sample of 800 interviews was distributed equally across the two governorates
12732,WB-2014-6.txt," Within each governorate, the selection of villages was dictated by the Egyptian government authority that was approving the survey work (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency)"
12733,WB-2014-6.txt," There were nine villages selected in Dakhalia, and 16 villages in Sharqia"
12734,WB-2014-6.txt, A total of 400 interviews were conducted in each governorate
12735,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Morocco, two regions (Al-Gharb, Chichaoua) were selected based on the extent of environmental degradation due either recent disasters or longer-term processes"
12736,WB-2014-6.txt," Within each region, 10 areas or strata were constructed across the entire region"
12737,WB-2014-6.txt," We considered each area (town) selected as its own stratum, and the 10 strata to be overall representative of the region"
12738,WB-2014-6.txt," There were 40 household interviews completed per stratum, under an equal allocation design"
12739,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In Syria we selected the governorates of Alhasaka in the northeast and Deir Ezzor in the east"
12740,WB-2014-6.txt," Within Alhasaka, six areas/provinces and 20 villages were selected from two of the four districts"
12741,WB-2014-6.txt," Some areas in Alhasaka were not eligible for inclusion due to safety concerns, no relevant climate/weather impacts, and language issues for areas that bordered Iraq"
12742,WB-2014-6.txt," In Deir Ezzor, 10 areas/provinces and 16 villages were selected"
12743,WB-2014-6.txt, These areas/provinces represented all three districts in Deir Ezzor
12744,WB-2014-6.txt, Interviews were divided equally between the two governorates
12745,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the Republic of Yemen, we selected the governorates of Taiz in the south and Hudayda in the western region"
12746,WB-2014-6.txt, The governorates were chosen because of their exposure to environmental degradation and high rates of migration due to environmental reasons
12747,WB-2014-6.txt, The sample of 800 interviews was allocated according to population size (58 percent in Taiz and 42 percent in Hudayda
12748,WB-2014-6.txt, The interviews were completed in 15 villages within Taiz and 11 villages within Hudayda
12749,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections"
12750,WB-2014-6.txt," This chapter focuses on part of the data collected in section five on perceptions related to extreme weather events and climate change, and in section eight on adverse events"
12751,WB-2014-6.txt," Specifically, the analysis focuses on household answers to four questions (data from the other sections are used for the regression analysis)"
12752,WB-2014-6.txt,"
First, households were first asked: ""Compared to 5 years ago, have you noticed any changes in the weather patterns in the following way?"" For each of a dozen types of potential changes in weather patterns, households could answer ""yes,""

""no,"" or ""don't know"" (two additional codes capture refusal to respond or feedback from the households that the condition is not applicable, but these cases were rare)"
12753,WB-2014-6.txt," The potential changes in weather patterns identified in the questionnaire were: ""Rainfall is more erratic; Less rain; More rain; More frequent drought; More frequent floods; More frequent rain storms; More frequent sand storms; Rainy season is shorter; The start of the rainy season is later; The end of the rainy season is earlier; The temperature is hotter; and finally The temperature is colder"
12754,WB-2014-6.txt,"""
Second, households were asked: ""Compared to 5 years ago, have you noticed any of the following changes in the environment?"" Again for each of a dozen options, households could answer ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know"
12755,WB-2014-6.txt,""" The types of changes in the environment listed were: ""Deforestation and less trees; More frequent livestock loss; More frequent crop failure; Less fish in rivers, lakes or sea; More air pollution; More water pollution in rivers, lakes, sea or streams; Less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams; Land is dryer; Less fertile land; More soil erosion; More insects and pests in crops; More diseases in animals and livestock; Towns and urban areas are more crowded; People have migrated out to other places"
12756,WB-2014-6.txt,""" Note that the last two types of changes in the environment result from human responses through migration to changes in weather patterns and the environment"
12757,WB-2014-6.txt," While migration itself may bring changes in the environment, those last two changes will not be included in the analysis of this chapter, which focuses more directly on changes in weather patterns and how they affect households"
12758,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The third important question in the section of the questionnaire in climate change used in this chapter relates to the impact of weather and environmental patterns"
12759,WB-2014-6.txt," Specifically, households were asked the following question: ""In the past 5 years, have you or your household experienced the following events as a result of weather and environmental patterns?"" As before, households could respond ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know"", this time for four different types of losses: ""Loss of crops; Loss of income; Loss of livestock or cattle; and Less fish caught"
12760,WB-2014-6.txt,"""
Finally, in section eight of the questionnaire, households were asked the following question: ""I am now going to read a list of adverse events that may have occurred over the last 5 years"
12761,WB-2014-6.txt," By shocks, I mean severe weather that has affected your household's welfare"
12762,WB-2014-6.txt," Thinking of adverse events over the last 5 years that have had an impact on your household, please tell me which one adverse event impacted your household the most?"" The potential answers for that question were the following: ""Drought; Flood; Storms; Mudslides; Excessive heat; Excessive rain; Pest infestation; and Crops and livestock diseases"
12763,WB-2014-6.txt,""" Given these four questions, the objective of the chapter is very simple: it is to document household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and their environment as well as adverse events, and whether these changes and events lead to various types of losses for households, depending on the households' characteristics"
12764,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Perceptions of Climate Change Do households believe that changes in weather patterns and their environment are taking place in the five countries? Before answering that question, it is
important to mention a caveat to the analysis"
12765,WB-2014-6.txt, Perceptions of changes in weather patterns need not mean that weather patterns are actually changing or that climate change is actually occurring
12766,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, while the questions were asked over the last five years, it could be that household responses reflect perceptions that have matured over a longer period of time"
12767,WB-2014-6.txt, The reason why the questions were asked about the last five years is that household recall of weather patterns is likely to be more accurate over that period than over longer periods of time
12768,WB-2014-6.txt," As to the reliance on data on perceptions, even if they may not always reflect reality very well (the issue of recall adds to that), they are still an important entry point in trying to understand how changes in weather patterns of the environment affect household livelihoods, and how households respond to such events"
12769,WB-2014-6.txt," In fact, at least to some extent, one might argue that decisions on how to cope with and adapt to changes in weather patterns and the environment may be influenced as much by how households and individuals perceive those changes than by the events themselves"
12770,WB-2014-6.txt, Thus the information is valuable
12771,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Household perceptions about changes in weather patterns and the environment have been ranked in table 4"
12772,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 according to the share of households sharing these perceptions (that is, answering ""yes"") in the five-country sample"
12773,WB-2014-6.txt, More than three fourths of households in the combined sample (77
12774,WB-2014-6.txt,"5 percent) declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters (72"
12775,WB-2014-6.txt,4 percent) declares that temperatures have increased
12776,WB-2014-6.txt," Between half and two thirds of households declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent"
12777,WB-2014-6.txt," Households also believe that the diseases are increasing for animals and livestock, that there are more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion"
12778,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A few of the extreme weather events often associated with climate change, such as rain storms and floods, are however not perceived as more frequent by a majority of households, but even for those events, almost half of respondents mention that they have increased in frequency (these events tend to be more localized, so it is to be expected that a smaller share of the sample would report them, which does not necessarily mean that they are less frequent)"
12779,WB-2014-6.txt," Some households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler (this is the case for almost half of the sample), and that there is actually more rain, but this is often the case only for a minority of households, and the overall picture that emerges is that of negative perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment, generally toward a dryer climate"
12780,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Basic statistics are also provided in table 4"
12781,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 on perceptions by country, and according to the welfare level of households"
12782,WB-2014-6.txt," The welfare quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of data on consumption"
12783,WB-2014-6.txt," The quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of good data on consumption"
12784,WB-2014-6.txt," There are clear differences between countries in perceptions, as expected"
12785,WB-2014-6.txt," In Syria, virtually all households declare that most of the changed in weather patterns
and in the environment are occurring"
12786,WB-2014-6.txt," In Egypt by contrast, none of the changes is reported by a majority of households, with the most frequent change reported being that of rain being more erratic by 43"
12787,WB-2014-6.txt,6 percent of households
12788,WB-2014-6.txt," The other three countries fall somewhere in between, with some changes reported more in some countries and others in others"
12789,WB-2014-6.txt," Of course, these data are not representative of the countries as a whole, but only of the two areas sampled in each of the countries"
12790,WB-2014-6.txt," Still, there is clear evidence that in most areas--with the exception of Egypt, households do perceive negative changes in weather patterns and the environment to take place"
12791,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, differences in perceptions by quintiles of well-being are smaller, also as expected, given that within areas all households should broadly notice the same changes in climate and the environment, even if the impact of these changes may not be the same for all households"
12792,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While table 4"
12793,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 provides detailed data on various dimensions of autonomy identified in the screening card, it is also useful to come up with summary measures or indices of autonomy"
12794,WB-2014-6.txt," These are obtained through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a technique used for analyzing the relationship between variables taking categorical values"
12795,WB-2014-6.txt," This type of analysis is often used to uncover the main underlying factors that capture the variance in a data set, typically with visualization along two or three dimensions"
12796,WB-2014-6.txt," Here, we are using the techniques to obtain aggregate indices of the changes in perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment"
12797,WB-2014-6.txt, By construction the indices constructed through the MCA are defined in such a way that they explain a share of the variance in the underlying variables as large possible
12798,WB-2014-6.txt," In implementing the MCA, we relied on the subset of variables related to the perceptions of weather patterns and the environment for which at least 5 percent of the sample responded in the affirmative, so as to reduce potential noise in the data"
12799,WB-2014-6.txt," Given that for most changes in weather patterns and the environment more than 5 percent of household declare that these changes are actually occurring, this procedure does not affect the results too much"
12800,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The results for the first two factors of the MCA are presented in tables 4"
12801,WB-2014-6.txt,2 and 4
12802,WB-2014-6.txt," In each table, the original variables are ranked according to their contribution to each of the two factors, by descending order of contribution"
12803,WB-2014-6.txt, For example in table 4
12804,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 the three variables contributing the most to the first factor are ""Land is dryer-No"" and ""Less Fertile Land ­No"", and ""Rainy season starts laterNo"""
12805,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, in table 4"
12806,WB-2014-6.txt,"3, the variables contributing the most to the second factor are ""More Rain-Yes"", ""More frequent floods-Yes,"" and More frequent rainstorms-Yes"""
12807,WB-2014-6.txt, The first factor explains a very large share (88
12808,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 percent) of the inertia or variance in the data included in the MCA, with the second factor explaining an additional 6"
12809,WB-2014-6.txt,0 percent of the inertia
12810,WB-2014-6.txt," Given that these two factors explain most of the inertia in the original variables, we will use only these two factors in the subsequent analysis"
12811,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider first table 4"
12812,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to understand intuitively what the first factor represents, it is necessary to look at both the contribution of each variable and modality to the factor, and the sign and value of the coordinates for the variables"
12813,WB-2014-6.txt," The first 12 largest contributors are all indicators of good climatic conditions in that there is no deterioration in these variables--land is not dryer nor is it less
fertile; the rainy season does not start later, nor is it shorter; droughts are not more frequent, and insects and pests in crops are not increasing, and so on"
12814,WB-2014-6.txt," The coordinates for all those variables are positive, so that when these modalities are observed in the data, the first factor takes on a larger value"
12815,WB-2014-6.txt," The next set of contributors include many variables that take a positive value--yes, there is more soil erosion and livestock losses, as well as more insects and pests in crops"
12816,WB-2014-6.txt," There is also less water in boreholes, the rain is more erratic, the land is less fertile, droughts are more frequent, and so on"
12817,WB-2014-6.txt," For these modalities, the coordinates are negative, suggesting that these modalities reduce the value assigned to the first factor"
12818,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, a higher value for the first factor thus suggests good weather conditions especially in terms of rainfall and its implications for land fertility, while a lower value suggests that negative structural changes are occurring, with less rain, more droughts, and thereby poorer agricultural conditions"
12819,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider next table 4"
12820,WB-2014-6.txt, The variables and modalities with the largest contributions to that factor are very different
12821,WB-2014-6.txt," More rain as well as more frequent floods and rainstorms are the first three contributors, and they have positive coordinates"
12822,WB-2014-6.txt," Negative answers to questions about the frequency of rainstorms and floods as well as the amount of rain are also important contributors, but with negative coordinates"
12823,WB-2014-6.txt," This second factor seems to capture the presence of excess water, especially through floods and rainstorms, which tend to be sudden events, as opposed to more structural conditions"
12824,WB-2014-6.txt," While a larger positive value for the first factor denotes good conditions, a larger positive value for the second factor is associated with excess water, which is a negative"
12825,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In order to facilitate the interpretation of the econometric analysis in section four, we will use the two factors of the MCA, but with two transformations"
12826,WB-2014-6.txt," First, we will consider the negative value of the first factor as our first summary climate variable"
12827,WB-2014-6.txt," This means that a larger positive value for the first factor will denote worse structural conditions in terms of climate (higher temperatures, reduced land fertility, more droughts and erratic rainfall, and so on)"
12828,WB-2014-6.txt," With that first transformation, larger positive values for both factors will denote worsening climate and environmental conditions"
12829,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, we will normalize the two factors so that they both take a value between zero and one (this is done by redefining each factor as its value minus the minimum value, and dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values)"
12830,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, a value close to zero will imply that the conditions are among the best in the sample, while a value close to one will denote some of the worst conditions in the sample"
12831,WB-2014-6.txt," For ease of interpretation, and even though this does not capture all of what the two factors represent, we will denote the two factors as respectively ""Dryer/Warmer Weather"" and ""Excess Rain"
12832,WB-2014-6.txt,""" The question will be whether these two factors are closely associated with losses for households"
12833,WB-2014-6.txt,"

excessive heat on the one hand and floods on the other hand--are closely related to the two factors that were obtained from the MCA in the previous section, although the MCA factors tend to capture a broader range of phenomena, including some of the consequences of changes in weather patterns, for example in terms of land fertility"
12834,WB-2014-6.txt, Note that there are differences between countries in table 4
12835,WB-2014-6.txt," In Syria, all households declare having been affected by droughts, which are also considered as the most damaging adverse event"
12836,WB-2014-6.txt," In Morocco by contrast, floods were the main adverse event affecting households"
12837,WB-2014-6.txt," There are also some differences between households according to their quintile of wealth, but these are less pronounced"
12838,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, the data suggest that households in the poorer quintiles are more likely to identify the adverse events that affected them the most, probably because they are more vulnerable to such events"
12839,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The fact that the poor are more likely to suffer from changes in weather patterns and the environment is confirmed by households' responses to the other question about the effect of these changes on them"
12840,WB-2014-6.txt," As mentioned in section two, households were asked whether in the last five years they suffered from lost income, lost crops, lost livestock or cattle, or less fish caught as a result of weather and environment patterns (the surveys do not provide data on the magnitude of the losses; they only inform us as to whether losses occurred)"
12841,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 4
12842,WB-2014-6.txt,5 summarizes the responses
12843,WB-2014-6.txt," More than half of all respondents said that changes in weather patterns and the environment led to a loss of crops, and more than a third reported a loss of income"
12844,WB-2014-6.txt," About a fourth reported a loss of livestock or cattle, and 8"
12845,WB-2014-6.txt,6 percent said that they caught less fish (this would be observed only for those households whose livelihood depend on fishing)
12846,WB-2014-6.txt," The results differ again between the countries, with especially high frequencies of losses of crops in Syria (remember that virtually all households in the areas surveyed reported suffering from a drought), and lower frequencies in Egypt"
12847,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet as expected, households belonging to lower quintiles of well-being were more likely than better-off households to declare having suffered from the various types of losses"
12848,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Do these results on the differentiated impact of adverse weather events on households depending on their welfare level still hold when conducting multiple regression analysis? The answer to this question is provided in table 4"
12849,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 which displays the results of standard probit regressions on whether households declare having lost income, crops, livestock/cattle, or caught less fish"
12850,WB-2014-6.txt," The marginal effects estimated at the mean of the sample are displayed, and the levels of statistical significance are based on robust standard errors"
12851,WB-2014-6.txt, Many of the variables included in the regression have statistically significant impacts on the probability of losses
12852,WB-2014-6.txt," There are differences between countries in the likelihood of losses as well as the types of losses incurred, which is not surprising, given the differences in the local economies in the various areas"
12853,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, losses in crops are most likely in the Republic of Yemen, which is also the country with the largest share of GDP accounted for by agriculture, while losses in income are most likely in Syria, which is the country in which more households reported adverse events"
12854,WB-2014-6.txt,"
As expected, the two climatic conditions factors have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of losses"
12855,WB-2014-6.txt, The impacts are large
12856,WB-2014-6.txt," Recalling that the climatic factors are normalized to take a value between zero and one, going from the best conditions (value of zero) to the worst conditions (value of one) in the sample for the first factor related mostly to droughts as well as dryer and warmer weather increases the probability of losses by 42"
12857,WB-2014-6.txt,"4 percent for crops, 45"
12858,WB-2014-6.txt,"8 percent for income, 31"
12859,WB-2014-6.txt,"0 percent for livestock or cattle, and 10"
12860,WB-2014-6.txt,8 percent for fishing
12861,WB-2014-6.txt," For the second factor, which is related mostly to floods and excess water, the impacts of going from best to worst conditions are of a similar order of magnitude, at 42"
12862,WB-2014-6.txt,"7 percent for crops (the same order of magnitude as that observed for the first factor), 27"
12863,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent for income, 34"
12864,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 percent for livestock or cattle, and 15"
12865,WB-2014-6.txt,1 percent for fishing
12866,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, even if the occurrence of adverse events and environmental conditions related to the first factor are more frequent than those related to the second factor, once those conditions come into play, both types of changes in weather patterns and environmental conditions have large negative effects on the livelihoods of households"
12867,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Also as expected, the probability of a loss is higher in many cases for poorer households"
12868,WB-2014-6.txt," This is clear for crop and income losses, where in both cases households in the bottom three quintiles of wealth tend to have an increase in the probability of a loss of about 10 percentage points as compared to households in the top quintile of wealth"
12869,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, losses in livestock and cattle as well as in fishing are highest in the fourth quintile of well-being, possibly because those households are more likely to be involved in these activities which tend to require more assets, while households in the top quintile tend not to be working much in agriculture"
12870,WB-2014-6.txt," It could of course be that part of the relationship between welfare levels and losses associated with adverse weather events is due to an endogeneity issue, in that the lower level of wealth observed for the households who suffered from a loss may reflect the loss itself"
12871,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet because of the way the questions are asked over a five-year period, and because welfare is measured through assets as opposed to income, it is likely that the correlations also reflect
simply a higher propensity of low-income households to be more exposed to such losses due to their occupations"
12872,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The relationship between occupation and losses actually comes out strongly as well in the regression"
12873,WB-2014-6.txt," First, households who own land (and probably cultivate it), and to some extent households who are land tenants, both tend to have a higher probability of losses related to adverse weather events"
12874,WB-2014-6.txt," A similar pattern is observed in terms of the types of occupation of the household head, with the highest marginal impact on the likelihood of losses for crops and incomes observed among the self-employed in agriculture, in comparison to the reference category of the salaried"
12875,WB-2014-6.txt," Those households who have better jobs as salaried worker, as well as households whose heads have higher levels of education, tend to be the least likely to suffer from crop, income, livestock/cattle, or fishing losses related to adverse weather events"
12876,WB-2014-6.txt,"
All of these results make sense, and the regressions simply display basic facts that are somewhat obvious--namely that households that tend to be poorer as well as those who rely on agriculture and livestock as well as fishing for their livelihoods are the most exposed to losses related to changes in weather patterns and environmental conditions"
12877,WB-2014-6.txt," The other variables in the regressions--such as the household size and the gender of the household head, do not have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of losses"
12878,WB-2014-6.txt, But two more variables display statistically significant correlations
12879,WB-2014-6.txt," First, in several instances households with younger household heads tend to be less affected by adverse weather shocks, perhaps because they tend to be less employed in traditional agricultural activities than households with older heads, with these effects being only partially controlled for in the regression through the other independent variables"
12880,WB-2014-6.txt," At the same time however, those who are single are more likely to suffer an income or livestock loss, perhaps at least in the first case because they are also more likely to be involved in casual labor that is less required when crops are destroyed by droughts or floods"
12881,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Conclusion
The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, as well as extreme weather events and their impact on households in the MENA region"
12882,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis was based on household surveys implemented in five countries, with a focus in each country on two areas more susceptible to be affected by adverse weather shocks"
12883,WB-2014-6.txt, The data suggest that a substantial majority of households do perceive important changes in the climate and their environment
12884,WB-2014-6.txt," Some of the most commonly reported changes include more erratic rain, higher temperatures, less rain, dryer and less fertile land, and more frequent droughts"
12885,WB-2014-6.txt," In some areas by contrast, excess rain is the issue, especially when it leads to floods"
12886,WB-2014-6.txt," As expected, these household perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment are strongly correlated with the likelihood that households declare having suffered from various types of losses in livelihood due to adverse climatic events"
12887,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Also as expected, the data suggest that households involved in agriculture, and especially the poor as measured through indices of wealth, are most likely to suffer from losses in crops and income, the two most frequently cited types of losses associated with adverse weather events"
12888,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, households who tend to be more protected through a better education and salaried employment are much less likely to suffer from the negative effects of perceived climate change and adverse weather shocks"
12889,WB-2014-6.txt," While none of those results are in themselves surprising, they help to set the stage for subsequent chapters devoted to an analysis of how households cope with these changes, first through migration, and then through other coping and adaptation mechanisms"

CHAPTER 5
Weather Shocks, Impacts, and Households' Ability to Recover in Morocco
Minh Cong Nguyen and Quentin Wodon

What is the likelihood that Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, may be confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts and floods? Who suffers the most from such events when they occur? To what extent are different types of households able to recover from such shocks? This chapter provides answers to these questions on the basis of questions on weather shocks added to a nationally representative household survey implemented in Morocco in 2009­10"
12891,WB-2014-6.txt," The data suggest that most households working in agriculture are affected by weather shocks, often seriously"
12892,WB-2014-6.txt," In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected is about one fourth"
12893,WB-2014-6.txt," A majority of households declare not being able to recover much from weather shocks, as well as other shocks"
12894,WB-2014-6.txt," But in comparison to other shocks, including unexpected increases in the prices of food and other basic essential commodities, households are slightly more likely to be able to recover from weather shocks"
12895,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
Climate change is expected to result in an increase in global temperatures by 3°C to 5°C in this century, as well as in a reduction in rainfall and greater seasonal temperature and rainfall variability in many areas"
12896,WB-2014-6.txt," Higher sea levels are also a threat to many areas, including in the MENA region where a large share of its population is located in low-lying areas"
12897,WB-2014-6.txt," With agriculture remaining essential for livelihood in the region, and existing conditions in terms of water scarcity being already precarious in many areas, climate change represents a significant concern for households"
12898,WB-2014-6.txt," Expectations are that extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent, which has implications for coping and adaptation mechanisms (for example, Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; UNDP 2009; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009; Verner 2012; World Bank 2010)"
12899,WB-2014-6.txt," For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction

of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
12900,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al
12901,WB-2014-6.txt," (2014a), both in this study"
12902,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the case of Morocco, periodic droughts have now become the norm rather than the exception"
12903,WB-2014-6.txt, These droughts tend to have substantial effects on households involved in agriculture in part because irrigated land is rare (Skees 2001; Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000)
12904,WB-2014-6.txt," The evidence points to a decrease in rainfall of up to 25 percent and an increase in the frequency of droughts over the last three decades, which in turn has led to an increase in the volatility of the contribution of agriculture to GDP (Azzam and Sekkat 2005; Barakat and Handoufe 1998; Skees 2001)"
12905,WB-2014-6.txt," While farmers have developed new ways to cope with droughts and the share of households relying primarily or solely on agriculture for their livelihood has decreased (Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000), many households remain engaged in agriculture and highly vulnerable to droughts, especially among the rural poor"
12906,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This chapter provides a new assessment of the extent to which households are subject to extreme weather shocks in Morocco, who suffers the most from these shocks, and whether households are able to recover from the shocks"
12907,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis is based primarily on perceptions, with households assessing subjectively the extent to which they are affected by weather shocks as well as their ability to recover from these shocks"
12908,WB-2014-6.txt, The data come from a recent nationally representative household survey data collected in Morocco in 2009/10
12909,WB-2014-6.txt," The main objective of the survey was to collect data on youth employment and civic engagement, but questions were added to the survey for this study on climate change both to assess to what extent households were affected by extreme weather events and to be able to compare their ability to recover from those shocks as opposed to other shocks"
12910,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The data suggest that virtually all households working in agriculture are affected by weather shocks, often seriously"
12911,WB-2014-6.txt," In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected by weather shocks is about one fourth, simply because this is also roughly the proportion of those involved in agriculture, with other households less likely to be affected"
12912,WB-2014-6.txt," A majority of households declare not being able to recover much from weather shocks, as well as a range of other shocks, and this is especially the case for poorer households"
12913,WB-2014-6.txt," But in comparison to other shocks, including unexpected increases in the prices of food and other basic essential commodities, households are slightly more likely to be able to recover from weather shocks"
12914,WB-2014-6.txt,"
These findings confirm, as was already observed in the analysis of chapter 4 (Adoho and Wodon, 2014), that the poor tend to be most affected by extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change, while they also have fewer means to cope with such events or recover from them"
12915,WB-2014-6.txt, The chapter is organized as follows
12916,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two introduces the data used for the analysis
12917,WB-2014-6.txt," Section three provides basic statistics on the extent to which households are affected by weather and other shocks, and whether they are able to recover from the shocks"
12918,WB-2014-6.txt," Section four provides a multivariate analysis of the correlates of both the likelihood of being affected by various shocks, and the ability to recover"
12919,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
12920,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Data
This chapter is based on data from the Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented in 2009/10"
12921,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey is nationally representative (even if it does not include the scarcely populated Western Sahara southern part of the country) and includes data on 2,000 households (1,216 in urban areas and 784 in rural areas)"
12922,WB-2014-6.txt, The survey was implemented with funding from the World Bank between December 2009 and March 2010
12923,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the questionnaire focused on issues critical to youth, and especially the obstacles that they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation"
12924,WB-2014-6.txt, Questions were also asked about young people's intentions to emigrate
12925,WB-2014-6.txt, Other more traditional modules deal with standard questions on household member demographics and education as well as employment information
12926,WB-2014-6.txt, The questionnaire also focused on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks
12927,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to be able to use the survey also for this work on migration in the MENA region, additional questions as well as options within existing questions were asked at the design stage of the survey on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions"
12928,WB-2014-6.txt," While the survey also included a separate instrument administered to most young individuals in the surveyed households, that part of the survey is not used here"
12929,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Apart from a range of household and individual characteristics which are used as controls in the regression analysis, a few central questions are used for the analysis presented in this chapter"
12930,WB-2014-6.txt," In section 6B of the questionnaire devoted to climate change and shocks in agriculture, households are asked the following question: ""Is one of the members of household involved in agriculture or agriculture related activities?"" For those households involved in agriculture, the following question was then asked: ""Over the last five years has your household faced the following problems?"" The list of problems identified was as follows: (1) Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (periodic and recurrent water scarcity due to droughts); (2) Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (too much rain or flooding); (3) Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields; (4) Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (that is too hot, too cold, too rainy, too dry); (5) Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields; (6) Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector; (7) Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions; (8) Reduction in the stock of livestock since the availability of grazing land is becoming less due to droughts and floods"
12931,WB-2014-6.txt," Next households were asked: ""How serious was the financial loss to the household due to these climate related factors listed above?"" The potential answers were very serious, moderate, serious, and negligible"
12932,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally households were asked ""Was (the household) forced to change the economic activity after the shock?""
In section 6A about the incidence of shocks and household responses, households are asked whether since November 2004, the respondent or a member of the household experienced various shocks"
12933,WB-2014-6.txt," The shocks listed are as follows: (1) Weather shocks (droughts; floods; pest infestation, crop and livestock diseases); (2) Unexpected increase in prices of food or other essential commodities
consumed; (3) Unexpected loss of job; (4) Involuntary reduction in employment or the number of hours worked; (5) Unexpected decline in prices or demand for products that you sell; (6) Unexpected increase in prices or shortages of inputs or products needed for your activity; (7) Loss of asset or of livestock due to theft, death, or accident; (8) Cut-off or decrease in remittances to household; (9) Death of main earner for the household; (10) Death of another member of the family; (11) Serious injury or illness that kept any member from doing normal activities; (12) Divorce or abandonment by husband; (13) Big amount of dowry for daughter's marriage; (14) Other (specify)"
12934,WB-2014-6.txt," For every shock that they were faced with, households are then asked ""Have you managed to recovered from the negative consequences of this shock?"" The possible answers were not at all, not much but some, much but not completely, or completely"
12935,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Basic Statistics
Information on the share of households involved in agriculture and affected by various climate and weather shocks is provided in table 5"
12936,WB-2014-6.txt," The data are provided by type of shock, and information is also reported on the share of households that have been affected by at least one of the shocks in the last five years in the sample of households involved in agriculture, as well as in the overall sample of households"
12937,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 5
12938,WB-2014-6.txt,1 suggests that 28
12939,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percent of households are involved in agriculture, with the proportion being as expected much higher in rural areas and in the lower wealth quintiles of the population (following standard practice, wealth quintiles were obtained using factorial analysis on a range of assets owned by households as well as dwelling characteristics)"
12940,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, in the bottom quintile of wealth, 70"
12941,WB-2014-6.txt,7 percent of households have at least one member involved in agriculture
12942,WB-2014-6.txt," Among those involved in agriculture, an overwhelming majority declares having been affected by at least one climate-related shock"
12943,WB-2014-6.txt, That proportion is at 92
12944,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percent, and does not vary too much according to the quintile of well-being of the household, although it is lower in the top quintile in comparison with other quintiles"
12945,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The most likely shock is a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (62"
12946,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent of households) followed by reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector (43
12947,WB-2014-6.txt,"9 percent), a reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (38"
12948,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 percent), and changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (34"
12949,WB-2014-6.txt,5 percent)
12950,WB-2014-6.txt," Other shocks affect less than a third of those involved in agriculture, but are still significant"
12951,WB-2014-6.txt," Among those involved in agriculture, there are few differences between quintiles in terms of the likelihood to be affected by specific shocks"
12952,WB-2014-6.txt," However, in the population as a whole, the likelihood of being affected by climate-related shocks is much higher in the bottom quintiles simply because the share of the population in those quintiles involved in agriculture is much higher, as already mentioned"
12953,WB-2014-6.txt, For example the proportion of those affected by the various shocks listed in table 5
12954,WB-2014-6.txt,1 is at 65
12955,WB-2014-6.txt,"8 in the bottom quintile nationally, versus 5"
12956,WB-2014-6.txt,3 percent in the top quintile
12957,WB-2014-6.txt," As to the seriousness of the shocks, it is also similar across quintiles, or at least
questions in that those involved in agriculture declaring being affected by the climate shocks are also in many cases those mentioning being affected by a weather shock in the other part of the questionnaire"
12958,WB-2014-6.txt, The fact that the two questions yield similar results is reassuring about the ability of the survey to identify those affected by climate shocks
12959,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The third largest type of shock in terms of the share of the households affected is the unexpected loss of job (14"
12960,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 percent), followed closely by a reduction in employment or hours worked (13"
12961,WB-2014-6.txt,5 percent)
12962,WB-2014-6.txt," The other shocks (serious injury/illness preventing work, shortage of inputs or increase in input prices, loss of assets or livestock, decline in prices or in the demand for sales, death of another family member, or death of the main income earner in the household) tend to affect a smaller of households"
12963,WB-2014-6.txt," For all 10 shocks identified in the survey, the likelihood of being affected is higher in the bottom quintile as compared to the top quintile, but the differential is especially large for weather shocks, as well as the loss of assets or livestock"
12964,WB-2014-6.txt," This is again related to the fact that the poor are much
more likely to make a living in agriculture and livestock, and are therefore much more likely to be affected by extreme weather events"
12965,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What about the ability of households to recover from shocks? This ability seems to be limited for most shocks"
12966,WB-2014-6.txt," About half of households declare that they were not able at all to recover from most shocks, including the increase in food/ other prices, unexpected job losses, a reduction in employment or hours worked, a serious injury or illness preventing work, a shortage of inputs/increase in prices, or a loss of asset/livestock"
12967,WB-2014-6.txt," The share of those not able to recover is slightly lower at about 40 percent for weather shocks as well as for a decline in prices/demand for sales and the death of other family member, but it is much higher for the death of the main income earner in the household, at 70"
12968,WB-2014-6.txt,4 percent
12969,WB-2014-6.txt," The share of those declaring being able to achieve some, but not a substantial recovery, is also high, so that only a relatively small minority of households declare being able to recover from the shocks substantially or fully"
12970,WB-2014-6.txt," In many cases, but not in all cases, poorer households tend to be less able to recover from various shocks than wealthier households, and this is especially the case of weather shocks"
12971,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, not only are poor households more likely to be affected by weather shocks due to their involvement in agriculture, but in addition they are also less likely to be able to recover from those shocks when they occur"

Correlates of the Likelihood of Shocks and the Ability to Recover
This section provides a more detailed analysis of the likelihood of being affected by various shocks and the ability to recover in a multivariate setting using regression analysis"
12973,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis is still descriptive, but it permits for example to assess whether some types of households, say by quintile of wealth, are more likely to be affected by shocks, or less likely to be able to recover when affected, controlling for other factors such as their geographic location"
12974,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Table 5"
12975,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 provides the results of simple probit regressions (with robust standard errors) for the correlates of the probability of being affected by the main types of shocks (for shocks affecting very few households, the regression analysis was not implemented)"
12976,WB-2014-6.txt, Consider first the coefficient estimates for the level of well-being of households by quintiles of wealth
12977,WB-2014-6.txt, There is clear evidence that poorer households tend to be more affected by many of the shocks than better-off households
12978,WB-2014-6.txt," In some cases, the coefficients are statistically significant only for the top quintile (the reference category being the bottom and poorest quintile), which suggests that only the wealthiest households are comparatively more protected than other households"
12979,WB-2014-6.txt, But in other cases there is a clear gradation in risk
12980,WB-2014-6.txt," This is the case for weather shocks, where the coefficients estimates are statistically significant for three of the four quintiles of wealth, and monotically decreasing as wealth increases"
12981,WB-2014-6.txt, Households in the top quintile are 13
12982,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 percentage points less likely to be affected by weather shocks that households in the bottom quintile controlling for other factors, and this decreases to 11"

12985,WB-2014-6.txt,"0 points for the second quintile, although that last coefficient is not statistically significant"
12986,WB-2014-6.txt," Similar monotonic or
quasi-monotonic gradation patterns are observed for a few of the other shocks (even though coefficients may not always be statistically significant) including especially job losses and less hours worked, as well as serious illnesses or injuries"
12987,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A number of other statistically significant coefficients are interesting"
12988,WB-2014-6.txt," As expected, when households own more than one acre of land, which is the case mostly for households involved in agriculture, or when the household head is involved in agriculture, they tend to be much more likely to be affected by weather shocks"

12992,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, households with substantial land are less likely to be affected by unexpected increases in food prices or other essential commodities, simply because many of these households tend to be net producers of food, so that they may actually benefit from increases in food prices"
12993,WB-2014-6.txt, Note however that households with a head involved in agriculture are more likely to be affected by the increase in food prices than the reference category of salaried work--so not all households in rural areas are protected from such food price increases
12994,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with land and those with a head involved in agriculture are both less likely to be affected by job losses, suggesting the protective effect of selfemployed for this type of shock"
12995,WB-2014-6.txt, But households with land are more likely to be affected by an increase in input prices and by losses of assets and livestock
12996,WB-2014-6.txt," A few other effects related to the occupation of the head are at work, including differences in the probability to lose work"
12997,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Urban households are less likely to be affected by weather shocks than rural households, but also somewhat surprisingly less likely to be affected by unexpected increases in the price of food, perhaps because they tend to be better of (even if this is partially controlled by the assets quintiles)"
12998,WB-2014-6.txt," Urban households are more likely to be affected by the death of the main income earner in the household, perhaps because they tend to be smaller and thereby without other income sources"
12999,WB-2014-6.txt," Larger households tend to be more affected by most shocks, which reflects the fact they live in areas more affected by weather shocks and that with more household members, the probability that at least one of them will suffer from a negative shock is simply higher"
13000,WB-2014-6.txt, Female-headed households are also more likely to be affected by several of the shocks; also this is compensated in part by the coefficient for the female adult ratio
13001,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with older heads are less affected by several of the shocks, possibly because of a higher rate of self-employment when working, but they are more affected by the possibility of the death of the main earner, as expected"
13002,WB-2014-6.txt," In general, a higher level of education for the household head is associated with a lower risk of being affected by shocks--this is mainly the case for weather shocks (since households with better educated heads work less in agriculture) and job losses or losses in hours worked (since individuals in households with better educated heads tend to have more secure and stable jobs), but there are a few cases when education is positively correlated with shocks"
13003,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In a few cases the likelihood of shocks is related to geographic location after controlling for household characteristics"
13004,WB-2014-6.txt," The reference geographic location in the regression model is the prefecture of Tanger-Tétouhan, which is located in the tip of the northern part of the country towards Spain"

13007,WB-2014-6.txt," It should not be inferred from these results that the likelihood of weather shocks is uniform across areas, but simply that the household survey data do not generate very marked profiles of weather shocks by area at the level of regions"
13008,WB-2014-6.txt," Of course, the fact that the household survey sample is limited in each of the regions (there are 14 regions included in the survey, and 2000 household, so that on average less than 150 households are included in the sample for each region) also contributes to the lack of statistical significance of the effects"
13009,WB-2014-6.txt," In a nutshell, while it is important to include geographic in the regression analysis, not too much should be inferred from the coefficient estimates for these controls"
13010,WB-2014-6.txt," But the results displayed according to household characteristics, and especially the vulnerability of poorer households to weather and other shocks, are important"

Conclusion
What is the likelihood that Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, may be confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts and floods?

How Do Households Cope with and Adapt to Climate Change?
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

What are the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies (apart from migration, which is discussed in part 3 of the study) that households use in order to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions? Are households forced to sell assets or take other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events? Beyond short-term emergency responses, are they taking measures to adapt to changing conditions? This chapter, which as was the case for chapter 4 is based on new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen, documents the coping and adaptation strategies of households as well as government and community responses to changes in weather patterns and the environment"
13032,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, the results suggest that coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse, but still limited, as are the community and government responses that could help them"
13033,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction

As already mentioned in previous chapters, weather and environmental conditions in many areas of the MENA region have worsened in the recent past and are expected to worsen further in the future"
13034,WB-2014-6.txt," This is likely to lead to substantial increases in temperature, reductions in rainfall, and a higher likelihood of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods (Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009; UNDP 2009; Verner 2012; World Bank 2010)"
13035,WB-2014-6.txt," These trends will exacerbate water scarcity issues and threaten agricultural sectors which remain essential for the livelihood of a substantial share of the population in many countries, and especially in some of the countries analyzed in this study (for a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
13036,WB-2014-6.txt, [2014] and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al
13037,WB-2014-6.txt, [2014a] in this study)
13038,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In chapter 4 of the study, an analysis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen suggested
that households living in areas exposed to weather shocks indeed do perceive a change in weather patterns and in their environment"
13039,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, a large majority of households declare having lost income, crops, livestock or cattle, or fish due to adverse weather events and changing environmental conditions over the five years preceding the surveys"
13040,WB-2014-6.txt, It was also shown that the poor have paid the highest price in terms of a higher likelihood of losses for the changes that are taking place in the climate
13041,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This chapter is based on the same data as that used in chapter 4 (on the data and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al"
13042,WB-2014-6.txt," 2014a, 2014b), but the focus shifts to a discussion of the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by the households when affected by adverse weather events or changes in their environment"
13043,WB-2014-6.txt, Both the households who declare having been affected by weather shocks and suffered losses and the population as a whole living in the areas where the surveys where implemented are considered
13044,WB-2014-6.txt," Apart from looking at household specific coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, data are also provided as to whether communities are promoting adaptation strategies at the local level, and whether the government also provides support for adaptation, as well as for coping among others through the availability of social protection programs that could help households in need"
13045,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The structure of the chapter is as follows"
13046,WB-2014-6.txt," Section two introduces the data used for the analysis, and especially the main questions in the surveys related to coping and adaptation"
13047,WB-2014-6.txt, Sections three and four respectively discuss households coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies
13048,WB-2014-6.txt, Community and government responses are discussed in section five
13049,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
13050,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Data and Methodology
As in chapter 4, this chapter relies on data from five household surveys implemented in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen"
13051,WB-2014-6.txt," In each country, 800 households were interviewed, typically in two main areas per country"
13052,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief description of the areas where the surveys were implemented in each of the countries was provided in chapter 2
13053,WB-2014-6.txt, The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections
13054,WB-2014-6.txt," This chapter focuses on part of the data collected in section five on perceptions related to extreme weather events and climate change, and specifically on the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by households to cope with changing climatic conditions and adverse weather shocks"
13055,WB-2014-6.txt," Data are also provided as to whether communities are promoting adaptation strategies, and whether the government also provides support to do so"
13056,WB-2014-6.txt,"
On coping, households who declared that they had experienced a loss of crops, income, livestock or fish due to weather shocks or changes in the environment were asked if they used the following coping strategies: (1) Selling or pawning livestock; (2) Selling or pawning assets other than livestock, such as land or jewelry; (3) Withdrawing children from school; (4) Using their savings; and finally (5) Asking for a loan"
13057,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, households who did not experience a loss linked to an adverse weather events were asked whether they would rely on
the same coping mechanisms in case they would experience such a loss"
13058,WB-2014-6.txt," In that case, households could say that they strongly agree that they would use the coping mechanisms, that they somewhat agree, that they somewhat disagree, or that they strongly disagree"
13059,WB-2014-6.txt," Statistics will be provided on the reliance on various coping mechanisms for both the households who did experience a loss and for the sample as a whole, including in that case the responses of households to the same question in the case of a hypothetical loss"
13060,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition to the basic statistics, regression analysis will be provided for analyzing the extent to which households who actually experienced a loss (and for whom the information may be more reliable) have used the various coping mechanisms"
13061,WB-2014-6.txt," For the regression analysis, a Heckman probit model is used with a first-stage probit regression on the probability of experiencing a loss, and a second-stage regression on whether households have relied on the specific coping strategy after the loss"
13062,WB-2014-6.txt," The identification variable for the system is the leave-out-mean probability of experiencing a loss in the area where the household lives, with the area defined as the primary sampling unit of the household in the survey dataset"
13063,WB-2014-6.txt,"
On adaptation, households were asked whether they have taken specific actions to adapt to changing weather patterns following losses of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes"
13064,WB-2014-6.txt," All households answered the question, not only those who declared having suffered losses"
13065,WB-2014-6.txt," The following potential actions that could be taken by households were listed: (1) change in the timing of planting the main crop; (2) change in the source from which the water is drawn; (3) as compared to five years ago, longer time to gather or collect water; (4) collecting more firewood; (5) as compared to five years ago, longer time to collect firewood; (6) terracing the land; (7) drilling boreholes; (8) change in the production technologies used, such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; (9) change in the crop choices, increase in the crop variety, or adopting drought or flood resistant crops; (10) change in the percentage composition of crops versus"
13066,WB-2014-6.txt," livestock; (11) increase in the use of fertilizer or pesticides; (12) seeking or increasing off-farm employment; (13) receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment; (14) using more stored water as compared to five years ago; (15) consuming more stored grains and stored animal products as compared to five years ago; (16) being aware of people moving out of the community as a result of weather or environmental changes; (17) in the last five years, having people moved into the community; (18) if people moved into the community, this leading to conflict in the community; (19) in the past five years, having personally experienced a conflict over agricultural land or livestock as a result of weather or environmental changes; and finally (20) in the last five years, having personally experienced a conflict over water for household use or cultivation as a result of weather or environmental changes"
13067,WB-2014-6.txt, Simple probit regressions are estimated to look at the correlates of the probability that households use the various strategies
13068,WB-2014-6.txt,"
On community-level responses, households were asked whether in order to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, their community had undertaken the following actions: (1) Planting trees or installing soil protection measures; (2) Building banks on rivers, streams
or small check banks to reduce flooding; (3) Developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation, or roads; (4) Gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income, or livestock; (6) Taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; (7) Taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts,and so on; and finally (8) Taking action to purchase seeds, animals or farm equipment"
13069,WB-2014-6.txt, The responses reflect the perception by households as to whether their community has adopted adaptation strategies
13070,WB-2014-6.txt," Because this provides only community-level information, only summary statistics are provided as opposed to a regression analysis on the correlates at the household level of these perceptions"
13071,WB-2014-6.txt," Correlates of perceptions might be interesting to analyze, but given that many households in the same community will respond in similar way to the questions, the information provided by those correlates may not be that useful"
13072,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, on government responses, households were asked whether in order to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the government had undertaken a number of actions"
13073,WB-2014-6.txt," While some actions are similar to those mentioned in the question on community responses, others refer more to social protection programs"
13074,WB-2014-6.txt," The list of options in the questionnaire was as follows: (1) Planting trees or installing soil protection measures?; (2) Building banks on rivers, streams, or small checking banks to reduce flooding; (3) Developing new infrastructure such as building boreholes and canals for irrigation or roads; (4) Providing seeds or fertilizer or fodder for livestock; (5) Providing storage facility for crops; (6) Providing cash or food for work; (7) Distributing cash for food during floods and droughts; (8) Providing drinking water; (9) Providing skills training programs; (10) Providing credit during crop loss; (11) Improving access to markets by providing transportation; and finally (11) Supporting prices when agricultural prices are low"
13075,WB-2014-6.txt," Again, the responses reflect the perception by households as to whether their government has provided support, and not whether they personally have received support"
13076,WB-2014-6.txt," For that reason, as for the community level responses, only summary statistics are provided in the analysis as opposed to regression analysis"
13077,WB-2014-6.txt,"
One more point requires a brief explanation regarding the way climatic conditions are treated in the analysis"
13078,WB-2014-6.txt, The survey questionnaire includes a large number of variables on the perceptions of households regarding various changes in weather patterns and their environment
13079,WB-2014-6.txt," Instead of trying to assess individually the impact of each of those variables on coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, we rely on two broader indices of household perceptions regarding climatic conditions that were constructed through a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)"
13080,WB-2014-6.txt, The approach used is discussed in chapter 4
13081,WB-2014-6.txt," What matters for the interpretation in this chapter is that the first factor mostly captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts and the lack of rain"
13082,WB-2014-6.txt," The second factor mostly captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods"
13083,WB-2014-6.txt," Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one, with one characterizing the worst conditions in the sample, and zero the best conditions"
13084,WB-2014-6.txt,"
asked whether they would use the various coping mechanism if they were affected by climate patterns in the future"
13085,WB-2014-6.txt," Households who strongly or somewhat agreed that they would use the mechanisms were codified as likely to use it, and those who somewhat or strongly disagreed were classified as not likely to use the mechanism, so that the information could be dichotomized and compared with the response provided by those affected by shocks"
13086,WB-2014-6.txt, In table 6
13087,WB-2014-6.txt,"1, the share of households actually using or likely to use the various mechanisms as a proportion of the total population is provided first (the top part of the table factors in those not affected by shocks)"
13088,WB-2014-6.txt, The statistics only for the subsample of households actually affected by losses is provided next
13089,WB-2014-6.txt,"
For the population as a whole, 60"
13090,WB-2014-6.txt,6 percent of households declare that they have used or would use their savings in case of a climate shock
13091,WB-2014-6.txt, This is followed by 46
13092,WB-2014-6.txt,"8 percent of respondents (typically household heads) who have sold or would sell their assets, 46"
13093,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 percent who have asked for a loan or would do so, 40"
13094,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent who have sold or would sell their livestock, and finally 36"
13095,WB-2014-6.txt,4 percent who have withdrawn or would withdraw their children from school
13096,WB-2014-6.txt, This last result on the potential impact on schooling of weather shocks is surprising and would warrant further analysis before being taken at face value
13097,WB-2014-6.txt," The proportions of households resorting to these various strategies tend to be higher among lower quintiles (which have fewer other ways to cope), and they are also higher among households declaring that they lost income, crops, or livestock/cattle, or caught
less fish, as expected"
13098,WB-2014-6.txt," There are differences between countries, especially regarding the possibility of withdrawing children from school--in Egypt this is not considered by most households"
13099,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, households receiving international remittances, who tend to be better off, are less likely to resort to coping strategies, except using their savings"
13100,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The responses for the subsample of those actually declaring a loss are fairly similar, which is not surprising, given that a majority of household do declare losses, as documented in chapter 4"
13101,WB-2014-6.txt," The main difference is that the reliance of households on the first four coping mechanisms is higher among those actually affected than among the sample as a whole, which could reflect the fact that an actual shock elicits more responses than a hypothetical one, but could also reflect the fact that the households actually affected tend to be poorer, which may require them to rely on such coping mechanisms more, even if many of the mechanisms such as selling livestock or assets, or withdrawing children from school often have adverse long-term consequences"
13102,WB-2014-6.txt," In the sample of those affected, the share of those who sold or pawned livestock increases to 42"
13103,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 percent, while that of those who sold other assets increases to 54"

13107,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent
13108,WB-2014-6.txt," The only case where the reliance on the coping mechanism is lower among those who incurred a loss than among the population as a whole is that of loans, which may again reflect the fact that those affected by losses tend to be poorer and thereby may not have access to credit, whether from friends or relatives or from financial institutions"
13109,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What about the correlates of the use of various coping mechanisms among the subset of households actually affected by a shock for which the information is likely to be more reliable than for the population as a whole? Table 6"
13110,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 provides the results of Heckman probit models (the first-stage probits on the probability

of experiencing a loss are not shown; they are very similar to the regressions presented in chapter 4)"
13111,WB-2014-6.txt," Country effects are still at work, but one interesting fact is that among those affected by shocks, the likelihood of using various mechanisms is not affected much by the quintile of wealth of the household (remember however that poorer households are often more likely to be exposed to losses due to adverse weather events)"
13112,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, households in areas

characterized by worsening droughts tend to be more likely to have to sell assets, while by contrast the impact of worsening floods (the second factor in the MCA analysis) is only marginally statistically significant"
13113,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, apart from causing losses, droughts and the lack of rain are likely to have further negative consequences for households by inducing them to sell assets, while this is not observed to the same extent for floods"
13114,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Another finding is that some types of losses increase the likelihood that households will rely on coping mechanisms"
13115,WB-2014-6.txt," Income losses are associated with a higher probability of relying on all coping mechanisms, while a loss in crops is associated with a statistically higher probability of relying on coping mechanisms in only three cases--selling or pawning livestock, selling or pawning other assets, and using one's savings"
13116,WB-2014-6.txt, A loss of livestock or cattle is associated with a likelihood of relying on two mechanisms--selling or pawning livestock and using one's savings
13117,WB-2014-6.txt, Catching less fish does not lead to a reliance on the various coping mechanisms
13118,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Landowners and tenants are more likely to have to sell livestock or ask for loans, but less likely to withdraw their children from school"
13119,WB-2014-6.txt," Understanding this difference in behavior regarding schooling would require a more detailed analysis, but a possibility might be that children from landowners and tenants might already be less likely to go to school, because of the necessity to work the land"
13120,WB-2014-6.txt, At this stage of the analysis this is only a conjecture
13121,WB-2014-6.txt," While the gender of the household head does not make much of a difference in terms of the coping mechanisms used, the education of the head does make a difference, with households with less-well-educated heads less likely to withdraw children from school, perhaps again because the children are already less likely to be in school"
13122,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, some of the occupations associated with lower earnings are also associated with a higher likelihood of withdrawing children from school"
13123,WB-2014-6.txt," Instead of reaching a conclusion here on these patterns of withdrawal of children to school, a more detailed analysis of schooling patterns (who is enrolled in what grade, for example) would be required before reaching conclusion on that specific coping mechanism"
13124,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Households benefitting from remittances are less likely to ask for a loan, probably because they already receive some cash in hand thanks to the transfers that they receive from friends or relatives who migrated"
13125,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with younger heads are less likely to sell assets or use their savings, and more likely to ask for loans"
13126,WB-2014-6.txt," This might be because they have fewer assets that they can sell or savings that they can use in times of difficulties because they have had less time to accumulate those, which then forces them to ask for loans, while households with holder heads have more options apart from loans"
13127,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with a head self-employed as a farmer are less likely to sell other assets, to use one's savings, or to ask for loans, perhaps because the ability of those households to do so is limited given their low earnings and accumulation potential or ability to repay loans"
13128,WB-2014-6.txt, The lower likelihood of asking for loans is also observed for the self-employed in other sectors and servants as well as unqualified workers
13129,WB-2014-6.txt," Those working in fisheries or pastoral activities are on the other hand more likely to sell livestock, as expected"
13130,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, households with a head in the public sector are less likely to

sell livestock or other assets, possibly because many do not have livestock to sell, and may also not need to sell assets"
13131,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Household Adaptation Strategies
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes"
13132,WB-2014-6.txt," The possibilities included changing production technologies such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; changing crop choices, increasing crop variety, or adopting drought or flood resistant crops; changing the percentage composition of crops versus livestock; increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides; seeking or increasing off-farm employment; and receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment"
13133,WB-2014-6.txt," Households were also asked whether compared to five years ago, they used more stored water or consumed more stored grains and stored animal products"
13134,WB-2014-6.txt," They were asked whether they were aware of people moving out of their community as a result of weather or environmental changes, and whether in the last five years people moved into their community"
13135,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, they were asked if in the past five years they experienced conflict over agricultural land or livestock, or water for household use or cultivation due to weather or environmental changes"
13136,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The results for those questions and most of the options available in the questionnaire are provided in table 6"
13137,WB-2014-6.txt," For the sample as a whole, and for most of the alternatives presented in the questionnaire, only a minority of households have implemented any single one of the adaptation strategies"
13138,WB-2014-6.txt," This is explained in part by the fact that many of the alternatives apply mostly to farming households, and not all households are involved in farming (this is evident in the fact that the proportion of households using the various adaptation strategies are higher among households who own land, many of whom farm their land)"
13139,WB-2014-6.txt," Between one in four and one in five households have relied more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought off-farm work, have used more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made a change in their farm production technology"
13140,WB-2014-6.txt, The proportion of those who have received training or changed their crop mix or the varieties they use is at about 15 percent
13141,WB-2014-6.txt, Only nine percent of households have changed their mix of crops and livestock for their livelihood
13142,WB-2014-6.txt,"
On the other hand, more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of their community due to the climate pressures, and 14 percent declare that some people have moved in, which may at time generate conflict over water, land, or livestock"
13143,WB-2014-6.txt," There are some large differences between countries in the use of adaptation strategies, with households in Egypt and Syria making fewer changes in their modes of livelihood than households in Algeria, the Republic of Yemen, and to some extent Morocco"
13144,WB-2014-6.txt," It also appears that households in the bottom quintiles, which tend to be affected by climate change the most and have limited means to cope with weather shocks and changing conditions, also have made more changes in their livelihood strategies"
13145,WB-2014-6.txt, But this may also be in part because a larger share of those households is involved in farming
13146,WB-2014-6.txt,"

As before households with international remittances who tend to also be better off tend to rely less on those adaptation strategies than other households"
13147,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In a similar way to the analysis presented in the previous section on the correlates of coping mechanisms, an analysis of the correlates of the adaptation strategies used by households can be provided"
13148,WB-2014-6.txt, This is done in table 6
13149,WB-2014-6.txt,4 with probit models for the main adaptation strategies
13150,WB-2014-6.txt," As for coping mechanisms, country effects are still at work, but among those affected by shocks, and in many cases the likelihood of using various adaptation strategies does not seem to be affected by the quintile of wealth of the household"
13151,WB-2014-6.txt," There are exceptions though, with statistical significance in the case of the first quintile, as compared to the reference category of the top quintile"
13152,WB-2014-6.txt," In many cases, the poorest households are more likely to use adaptation strategies, probably because they are also those affected the most by climate change, as documented in chapter 4"
13153,WB-2014-6.txt," But in a few cases, households in the bottom quintile are less likely to adopt a strategy, and this is especially the case for terracing the land, increasing the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and (knowing people who are) moving out, three options that are often costly and may therefore be out of reach for the very poor (the fact that the very poor are less likely to witness conflict over water could possibly signal their lack of access or property rights over water)"
13154,WB-2014-6.txt,"

As for coping mechanisms, households in areas characterized by worsening droughts are more likely to use most of the adaptation strategies listed, which makes sense given that they are more affected by adverse weather events"
13155,WB-2014-6.txt," Apart from a few coefficients that are not statistically significant, the only exception is for terracing the land, which may again denote the cost of the option and may not be very effective against droughts"
13156,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, and this is different from what was observed for coping mechanisms, households more affected by floods and associated conditions are also more likely to rely on adaptation strategies"
13157,WB-2014-6.txt," The only exception is the reliance on stored water, which is clearly not needed when suffering from an excess of water"
13158,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What about the impact of the type of loss suffered, when such loss was incurred? As for coping mechanisms, income losses tend to be associated with a

higher probability of using many of the adaptation strategies when the effects are strongly statistically significant, at least at the five percent level"
13159,WB-2014-6.txt," Similarly, all strongly statistically significant effects for the loss of crops indicate a higher use of adaptation strategies"
13160,WB-2014-6.txt," For livestock, the effects are more varied, with a higher use of some adaptation strategies and a lower use of others"
13161,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Landowners are also more likely to use the various adaptation strategies"
13162,WB-2014-6.txt, This is again as expected given that they tend to be more affected by adverse weather events
13163,WB-2014-6.txt," The same is observed for land tenants, but to a slightly lower extent in terms of the magnitude of the coefficients, their statistical significance, and some cases with opposite effects (for people moving out and conflicts over water, although the second effect is only marginally significant"
13164,WB-2014-6.txt,")
There are also some statistically significant effects in terms of the characteristics of the household head according to age, gender, marital status, education, and occupation, but these are more the exceptions as opposed to the rule given that many coefficients are not statistically significant"
13165,WB-2014-6.txt," Still, households with younger heads are less likely to use many of the adaptation strategies, whether this is because they have fewer means to do so or because they have other options, including that of migration which is often undertaken by younger individuals"
13166,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with a head working as a public employee are also less likely to have to resort to many of the adaptation strategies, the only positive and statistically significant effect being that of the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which is likely to be more affordable to them"
13167,WB-2014-6.txt, Another result which was to be expected is that farmers are also more likely to rely on some of the strategies
13168,WB-2014-6.txt," What these results suggest is that even though overall the likelihood of using the various adaptation strategies is low in the sample, it is higher for those households who needs such strategies the most, both because of their occupation (in agriculture) and because of their exposure to shocks as captured by the two factors reflecting changes in weather conditions"
13169,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Community-Level and Government Responses
In the previous two sections, information was provided about ways in which households cope with or adapt to weather or environmental changes"
13170,WB-2014-6.txt," What about the role of communities and governments? As mentioned in section two, the survey questionnaire asked households whether to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which the household live implemented a number of initiatives"

13178,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Similar questions were asked about the role of governments, albeit as mentioned in section two with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low"
13179,WB-2014-6.txt, The results are provided in table 6

Conclusion
The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of how households cope with and adapt to changing climatic conditions in the MENA region"
13186,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis of new household survey data from five countries suggests that while changes in weather patterns and the environment of households have affected a large majority of households, the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with those shocks are limited"
13187,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Many households appear to have to sell livestock of other assets when affected by adverse weather events, and a large share also appears to be withdrawing

children from school"
13188,WB-2014-6.txt," The ability to ask for loans seems to be limited in the bottom quintiles, while savings can be quickly exhausted"
13189,WB-2014-6.txt," These coping mechanisms, while necessary in the short term, may put at risk the ability of households to increase their earnings in the future, including for the children"
13190,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Furthermore, while the likelihood of using various adaptation strategies is higher among the most affected households, virtually all the adaptation strategies are implemented only by a small minority of households"
13191,WB-2014-6.txt," This suggests that while adaptation is taking place, it may not be taking place at the level that the deteriorating climatic conditions appear to call for"
13192,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, the extent to which households benefit from community level and government programs and initiatives to help them cope with and adapt to weather and environmental changes is limited"

CHAPTER 7
Do Changes in Weather Patterns and the Environment Lead to Migration?
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

Migration is one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions as well as extreme weather events"
13194,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide, the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of survey and other data"
13195,WB-2014-6.txt," This chapter is based on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen in two climate affected areas per country"
13196,WB-2014-6.txt," The chapter provides an analysis of the impact of changes in weather patterns and the environment (as perceived by households) on migration, both by members residing in the households (temporary migration) and former household members who have left (permanent migration)"
13197,WB-2014-6.txt, The results suggest that perceptions of negative changes in weather patterns and the environment are indeed associated with a higher likelihood of migrating temporarily or permanently
13198,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
There is a consensus that adverse weather events are likely to lead to migration as individuals and households migrate under climate pressures in order to improve their livelihoods"
13199,WB-2014-6.txt," Such population movements have been taking place for thousands of years (Gupta, Anderson, and Pandey 2006), and today the resulting pressures are accelerating the process of urbanization, given that those most affected by climate change tend to be involved in agriculture in rural areas"
13200,WB-2014-6.txt," With the climate expected to worsen in many parts of the world, including the MENA region, there is substantial concern that migration may accelerate, whether one refers to tye4rms such as environmental migration, forced environmental migration, environmentally motivated migration, climate refugees, environmental displaced persons, disaster refugees, environmental displaced persons, or eco-migrants to refer to this reality"
13201,WB-2014-6.txt," Some estimates suggest that hundreds of millions of people may have to migrate in the next thirty to fifty years (Christian


Aid 2007; Foresight 2011; Jakobeit and Methmann 2007; Stern Review 2006), but there is considerable uncertainty about when and even whether such migration will take place"
13202,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Of course, climate change is not the only factor that may lead to migration"
13203,WB-2014-6.txt," Most migrants today migrate in search of economic opportunities, and this search is only partially related to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events such as droughts or floods in rural areas"
13204,WB-2014-6.txt," Said differently, there is probably no such thing as a `pure' climate migrant"
13205,WB-2014-6.txt," In fact, the empirical evidence on the effect of climate patterns on migration remains limited, and different patterns may yield very difference responses"
13206,WB-2014-6.txt," While fast-onset disasters may induce only temporary displacement (for example, Findley 1994; Haug 2002; Paul 2005), longer-term trends toward desertification or sea-level rise may have slower but more definitive impacts on the ability of households to remain in certain areas"
13207,WB-2014-6.txt," Because of the many ways in which climate patterns may affect migration, and because migration is itself affected by many other dimensions apart from climate patterns, estimating the impact of weather or environmental conditions on migration is not easy"
13208,WB-2014-6.txt," Ideally, it would be best to have data on changes in climate, as well as changes in migration patterns, and to correlate both while taking also into account data on many other factors that may affect migration"
13209,WB-2014-6.txt," But such datasets are scarce, especially in the Middle East and North Africa where household surveys are few and often not publicly available"
13210,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This chapter is based on new household survey data collected in 2011 in five countries--Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen (on data collection and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al"
13211,WB-2014-6.txt," 2014a, 2014b)"
13212,WB-2014-6.txt," For a brief review of the literature which informed the data collection and this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
13213,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al
13214,WB-2014-6.txt," (2014a), both in this study"
13215,WB-2014-6.txt,"
One of the objectives of the surveys was to assess whether perceptions of climate change on the part of households affect migration decisions on the part of household members"
13216,WB-2014-6.txt, The same household survey was implemented in two climate-affected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context
13217,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey elicited data on household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, and measured whether household members have migrated either temporarily (this is referred to as resident migration because the member still resides in the household) or permanently (this is referred to as nonresident migration)"
13218,WB-2014-6.txt,"
There are a number of limits to the analysis that can be conducted with such data"
13219,WB-2014-6.txt," First, because the surveys were implemented in sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we do not record information on the migration of entire households--we only record the migration of household members"
13220,WB-2014-6.txt," This is however not too much of a problem given that most migration is typically undertaken by household members, instead of entire households"
13221,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the surveys are not meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country"
13222,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, it must be
recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate shortterm versus long-term household responses"
13223,WB-2014-6.txt," As we are working with cross-sectional household surveys and subjective perceptions of households regarding their environment, it could be that household perceptions of climate change are wrong--even if households declare that rainfalls are becoming more erratic, this may not be the case in reality"
13224,WB-2014-6.txt," At the same time, one could argue that decisions such as that of migrating are influenced at least as much by the perceptions of households of the reality as by the reality itself"
13225,WB-2014-6.txt,"
These caveats being clear, the chapter is organized as follows"
13226,WB-2014-6.txt," Section two introduces the data used for the analysis, and some of the questions in the surveys which are the focus of the discussion"
13227,WB-2014-6.txt, Section three provides estimates of migration rates according to both household and individual-level characteristics
13228,WB-2014-6.txt, That section also discusses results on the subjective reasons mentioned by households as to why some of their members have migrated
13229,WB-2014-6.txt, Section four provides an analysis of the correlates of migration
13230,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
13231,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Data
As was the case for chapters 4 and 6 in this study, this chapter is based on the analysis of new household surveys implemented by Rand under contract with the World Bank and the Agence Française de Développement in five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen"
13232,WB-2014-6.txt, The same household survey instrument was used in all countries with minor adjustments to reflect country context
13233,WB-2014-6.txt," In each country, approximately 800 households were interviewed in two regions that tend to be affected by extreme weather events ranging from droughts to floods"
13234,WB-2014-6.txt," For a discussion of the areas where the survey was implemented in each of the five countries, the reader is referred to chapter 3 which provides the necessary details"
13235,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While the data from all five countries were used without substantial problems in chapters 4 and 6, an important caveat must be noted for this chapter"
13236,WB-2014-6.txt," Unfortunately, the quality of the migration data for one of the countries-- Algeria--is not as good as that for the other four countries"
13237,WB-2014-6.txt, There are two different issues that must be acknowledged for the analysis conducted in this chapter
13238,WB-2014-6.txt," First, the Algeria survey turned out to have been implemented without proper and systematic identification of individuals within households, so that it is not clear that an individual coded, say, 5 in one section of the questionnaire is the same individual as the individual coded 5 in another section of the questionnaire"
13239,WB-2014-6.txt, This means that individual-level regressions cannot be implemented with the Algeria dataset
13240,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This problem does not affect household level regression analysis in other parts of the study as long as the household level analysis includes variables for the household as a whole or the household head (who is the first individual on which data is collected in the various sections)"
13241,WB-2014-6.txt," But it does affect regressions that require information on each of the individuals in the household, which is the
case for migration"
13242,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, neither statistics nor regression results will be provided for Algeria at the level of individuals, although we will provide some basic statistics at the level of households for that country as well as for the four other countries"
13243,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, the resident migration rates obtained for Algeria appear to be far too low"
13244,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, even though we will provide basic migration statistics for that country at the level of households, the results may not be as valid as those for the other countries, and again the detailed individual level statistics and the regression analysis will be conducted only with the sample for the other four countries"
13245,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The questionnaire for the surveys enables us to look at both temporary or resident and permanent or nonresident migration"
13246,WB-2014-6.txt," We define temporary migration as migration by household members who are still considered as members of the households, while permanent migration refers to migration by household members who have left the household"
13247,WB-2014-6.txt," It must be emphasized that because the surveys are not nationally representative and were implemented only in two sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we are not able to provide estimates of migration by entire households away from the sending areas--we only record the migration of household members"
13248,WB-2014-6.txt," As noted in the introduction, this is however not too much of a problem, given that most migration is undertaken by household members, instead of entire households"
13249,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The survey questionnaires provide information on the migration of both resident and nonresident household members"
13250,WB-2014-6.txt," While many surveys do have information on resident members, relatively few surveys also have a special module asking questions about nonresident migrants, but our surveys do"
13251,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, the surveys include a detailed module on household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment"
13252,WB-2014-6.txt, The perceptions of these changes can then be related to the decision by some household members to migrate temporarily or permanently
13253,WB-2014-6.txt," It could be that household perceptions about the changes in weather patterns and their environment are mistaken, but even if this were the case, perceptions probably matter as much as real events in how household members make decisions regarding migration"
13254,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Apart from basic statistics, we rely on regression analysis of the correlates of migration decisions in order to assess the impact on migration at the margin (controlling for a range of household and individual characteristics) of differences in perceptions about changes in weather patterns and the environment"
13255,WB-2014-6.txt, But we will also use a direct question asked to households about the main reasons for the migration of some of their members
13256,WB-2014-6.txt," The question was asked for resident migrants as follows: ""What were the two most important reasons why [NAME] moved here? Please state in order of importance: a--First reason; b--Second reason"
13257,WB-2014-6.txt,""" The potential answers for respondents listed in the survey questionnaire were as follows: (1) Better employment opportunity (seasonal jobs) in the destination; (2) Divorce/separation/death of spouse; (3) Better employment opportunity (nonseasonal jobs) in the destination; (4) Delivery; (5) Lack of employment opportunity in place of origin; (6) Family problems; (7) To accumulate savings; (8) Accompany patient; (9) Transferred (job); (10) Escape flood; (11) Schooling; (12) Escape
drought; (13) Better infrastructure; (14) Poor quality of land or depleted soils; (15) Join family; (16) Civil conflict/war; (17) Marriage; and finally (18) Other"
13258,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Of those answers, the options related to droughts and floods are directly related to extreme weather events, and some of the other options, such as the poor quality of land or depleted soils may be indirectly related to change in weather patterns and the environment"
13259,WB-2014-6.txt," A similar question is asked to nonresident migrants, although with only one main reason for migration provided instead of two for nonresident migrants"
13260,WB-2014-6.txt, Comparing the information obtained from those subjective perceptions of migration with the results from the regression analysis provides a way to check if the order of magnitude of the coefficient estimates obtained from the regression analysis appear to make sense or not

migrants, whether resident or nonresident"
13262,WB-2014-6.txt," When the question is restricted to migrants over the last five years, the proportion is lower, at 23"
13263,WB-2014-6.txt,3 percent
13264,WB-2014-6.txt," Having nonresident migrants is more likely than having resident migrants, which suggests that the rate of permanent departure is fairly high"
13265,WB-2014-6.txt," This is explained in part because some nonresident migrants leave the household to marry, which is a normal demographic process, but most nonresident migrants actually leave for other reasons, as will be discussed in more details below"
13266,WB-2014-6.txt,"
There are large differences between countries in the likelihood of migration, especially among resident members"
13267,WB-2014-6.txt, Migration rates are highest in Syria where almost half of the households have migrants and the Republic of Yemen where a third of households have migrants
13268,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, migration rates are lowest in Algeria"
13269,WB-2014-6.txt," In that country, while the nonresident migration rate may be realistic, the resident migration late appears to be very low, so one could wonder if there is not a data issue here, although a very low nonresident migration rate is also observed for Morocco"
13270,WB-2014-6.txt," What is clear is that migration rates depend substantially on the particular features and history of each country, and indeed each region within the five countries"
13271,WB-2014-6.txt," While there are differences in migration rates between quintiles of wealth, these do not appear to be very large, even if resident migration rates tend to be lower in higher quintiles"
13272,WB-2014-6.txt, More differences will emerge when looking at the characteristics of individual migrants
13273,WB-2014-6.txt," There are also differences in migration rates according to whether households suffered from losses due to adverse weather events, but again they tend for the most part not to be very large"
13274,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The most important finding from table 7"
13275,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 for our purpose is the fact that there are differences in migration rates according to perceptions of changes in the
climate of the areas in which households live"
13276,WB-2014-6.txt," In chapter 4 of this study, Adoho and Wodon (2014) construct through a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) two indices or factors that summarize household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment"
13277,WB-2014-6.txt," The first factor mostly captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts and the lack of rain"
13278,WB-2014-6.txt," The second factor mostly captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods"
13279,WB-2014-6.txt, Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one
13280,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In table 7"
13281,WB-2014-6.txt,"1, migration rates are computed according to the quintiles of climate perceptions of households"
13282,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, the first quintile for the first factor consists of the households who tend to perceive that the climate is not getting dryer and warmer, while the top quintile consists of those households who perceive that the climate is getting much more dry and warm, and these are the households most likely to be affected by droughts"
13283,WB-2014-6.txt," The same interpretation holds for the quintiles of the second factor, whereby those in the top quintile are most affected by excess water, which essentially again is associated with floods"
13284,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 7
13285,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 suggests that household level migration rates are substantially higher in the top quintile of the first MCA factor than in the bottom quintiles, and this holds for both resident and nonresident migrations"
13286,WB-2014-6.txt, The differences are not as clear-cut for the second factor
13287,WB-2014-6.txt," Resident migration rates are lower in the top quintile of the second MCA factor, while nonresident migration rates are higher in the top quintile"
13288,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Statistics were presented at the level of households in table 7"
13289,WB-2014-6.txt,1 in part in order to be able to include Algeria in the analysis
13290,WB-2014-6.txt, But it is more interesting to analyze migration decisions at the individual level and data are available at that level
13291,WB-2014-6.txt, This is done table 7
13292,WB-2014-6.txt,"2, although as mentioned in section two, Algeria is excluded from
this analysis"
13293,WB-2014-6.txt, Some 7
13294,WB-2014-6.txt,"6 percent of individuals in the sample as a whole have migrated temporarily, and the proportion over the last five years is 6"
13295,WB-2014-6.txt,2 percent
13296,WB-2014-6.txt," For permanent migration, the rates are 8"
13297,WB-2014-6.txt,"0 percent in the sample as a whole, and 5"
13298,WB-2014-6.txt,7 percent in the last five years
13299,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration rates at the level of individuals are by definition lower than at the level of households since only a subset of the household members migrate, but many of the points already made at the level of households remain"
13300,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, migration rates are higher in Syria and the Republic of Yemen than in Egypt, and lowest in Morocco among the four countries for which data are provided"
13301,WB-2014-6.txt," Importantly, while nonresident migration rates were higher than resident migration rates at the level of households, the two rates are of a similar order of magnitude when considering individuals"
13302,WB-2014-6.txt," This is not surprising since, among other factors, resident migration is less costly to finance for a households than nonresident migration, so that more household members can migrate temporarily than permanently"
13303,WB-2014-6.txt," There are some differences in migration rates by quintiles of wealth, landownership status and according to the types of losses suffered due to adverse weather events, but these tend not to be systematic"
13304,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Differences tend to be much more systematic when looking at the characteristics of the migrants"
13305,WB-2014-6.txt," First, migration rates tend to be higher among heads of household for resident migration (heads tend to be those going away temporarily to find work), while they are lower for household heads among nonresidents (who have a household to take care of and cannot leave other household members behind permanently)"
13306,WB-2014-6.txt, The likelihood of migrating is clearly higher for younger individuals (those below the age of 30) than for older individuals (for example those aged 40 or above)
13307,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration rates are higher for men than for women, and this is especially the case for nonresident migration"
13308,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, migration rates are higher when the individuals are more educated, probably because the opportunities for the more educated to find better employment opportunities elsewhere tend to be higher (for nonresident migrants, the top two categories of education have been merged in the statistics as is done for the regressions)"
13309,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What is however of higher interest for this chapter is the relationship between individual migration rates and the climatic conditions of the areas where households live"
13310,WB-2014-6.txt," The observation made regarding higher household-level migration rates in areas with poor conditions in terms of droughts remains--individuallevel migration rates are still higher in the top quintile of the first MCA factor than in the bottom quintiles, and this holds for both resident and nonresident migrations"
13311,WB-2014-6.txt," But now, we also have at the level of individuals a positive relationship between high values for the second MCA factor, indicating areas subjected to floods, and migration rates, especially when considering the extent of migration over the last five years, which is also the interval on which the two factors for the perceptions about climate change are estimated"
13312,WB-2014-6.txt," There is thus some statistical evidence that worse climatic conditions, or more precisely perceptions of negative changes in weather patterns and the environment, are associated with more migration"
13313,WB-2014-6.txt,"
To what extent are climate factors key determinants of migration? While this question is best answered using multivariate regression analysis, as mentioned in section two indicative information can also be obtained from direct responses given by respondents in the survey (typically household heads) about the reasons for migrating"
13314,WB-2014-6.txt, The statistics on the self-declared reasons for migration are provided in table 7
13315,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of nonresident migration, up to two reasons for migration could be provided, while only the main reason could be provided in the case of resident migration"
13316,WB-2014-6.txt," Note that the data appear to be of better quality in the case of nonresident migration, where missing values are rare"
13317,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of resident migration by contrast many responses are missing, but the available responses are still instructive"
13318,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the case of nonresident, the two main reasons to migrate are the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment opportunity in place of origin"
13319,WB-2014-6.txt," Both reasons are related, but in terms of the language used, the first reason can be associated more with pull factors at the area of destination, while the second can be associated more with push factors from the area of origin"
13320,WB-2014-6.txt," Together, those two reasons account for more than half of all departures for which information on the reasons to migrate is available"
13321,WB-2014-6.txt," Marriage comes third
as the main reason to migrate permanently, reflecting the natural departure of young adults from the household"
13322,WB-2014-6.txt," But when considering the second main reason to migrate permanently, accumulating savings is much more often mentioned than marriage, and that reason is also prominent as a factor leading to resident or temporary migration"
13323,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate factors are mentioned as reasons for both nonresident and resident migrations, but not very often"
13324,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of nonresident migration for example, 5"
13325,WB-2014-6.txt,"7 percent of migrants cite the need to escape a drought as the first reason to migrate (virtually all households mentioning droughts are from the Syria survey, as shown in the annex), and another 5"
13326,WB-2014-6.txt,"9 percent mention droughts as the second reason to migrate (again, mostly in Syria)"
13327,WB-2014-6.txt," Floods are also mentioned, but to a lower extent"
13328,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the case of resident migration, the data are not very good due to a large number of missing values, but when those missing values are eliminated, droughts are also mentioned as the first reason to migrate by around five percent of migrants"
13329,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, it is likely that the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment at the places of origin are also related in part to poor climatic conditions in the places of origin"
13330,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, as is the case for permanent migration, even if climatic factors may not be the main factor at play for the current patterns of temporary migration, they do appear to have a significant role"
13331,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Correlates of Resident and Nonresident Migration
While the basic statistics reviewed so far provide useful information on self-declared reasons to migrate (as seen from the point of view of the main respondent to the survey, which is typically the household head), a more robust and detailed analysis can be conducted using multivariate regression analysis"
13332,WB-2014-6.txt, Recall in the discussion of the basic statistics the emphasis placed on comparing migration rates according to the level of climatic stress of households using the synthesis variables created by the multiple correspondence analysis
13333,WB-2014-6.txt, The basic statistics suggested higher rates of migration in areas with higher climatic stress
13334,WB-2014-6.txt, The question for the regression analysis is whether this apparent relationship between climatic factors and migration remains after controlling for a range of household and individual characteristics
13335,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Tables 7"
13336,WB-2014-6.txt,4 and 7
13337,WB-2014-6.txt,5 give the results from probit regression on the correlates of resident and nonresident migrations
13338,WB-2014-6.txt," Resident migrants are still considered to be part of the household, while nonresident migrants have left the household"
13339,WB-2014-6.txt, The estimations are done for the sample as a whole and for those who migrated over the last five years
13340,WB-2014-6.txt, In each case two alternative specifications are provided
13341,WB-2014-6.txt," In the first specification, the losses incurred by households due to adverse weather events are included in the set of independent variables"
13342,WB-2014-6.txt," In the second specification this is not done, given that these losses themselves are a result of adverse weather events, so that including them in the set of independent variables may take away some of the impact of weather events on migration"
13343,WB-2014-6.txt," This does however not appear to be the case as most of the results are not very sensitive to the
difference in specification (with or without losses from adverse climate), but testing for the possibility that this could have happened was important"
13344,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The main variables of interest are the two MCA factors"
13345,WB-2014-6.txt," Recall that these factors are normalized between zero and one, with values of zero denoting the best climatic conditions in the sample and values close to one denoting the worst conditions"
13346,WB-2014-6.txt," The first factor captures events such as droughts and the lack of rain, while the second captures instead excess rain, and especially floods"
13347,WB-2014-6.txt, In table 7
13348,WB-2014-6.txt,"5, higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of resident migration, with the coefficients being statistically significant and the effects of each of the two factors of a similar order of magnitude"
13349,WB-2014-6.txt," Tthe effects for nonresident migration are similar, although statistically significant only for the whole period, as opposed to the last five years"
13350,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus overall higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of both temporary and permanent migration"
13351,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, in the specification with the losses incurred due to adverse weather events, the maximum increase in the sample in the value of any one of the two factors from zero to one would yield an increase in the probability of resident migration of about five percentage points when considering the whole sample, and about 3"
13352,WB-2014-6.txt,5 points when considering the last five years
13353,WB-2014-6.txt," That the increase is larger for the sample as a whole was to be expected, given that migration rates are higher when considering a longer period of time during which migration may take place"
13354,WB-2014-6.txt, The effects are slightly smaller in the specification without losses
13355,WB-2014-6.txt," For nonresident migration, the effects are smaller, but still of a similar order of magnitude, especially for the full period estimation"
13356,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Are these estimates likely to be of the right order of magnitude? This is of course a very difficult question to answer with limited data, but a comparison
between the results suggested by the regression analysis and the data on subjectively declared reasons for migration mentioned in the previous section helps in provide at least a partial cross-check"
13357,WB-2014-6.txt, Consider a large increase in the value of the MCA indices of 0
13358,WB-2014-6.txt,"30 (those indices are scaled to take a value between zero and one, so that an increase in the value of any one of the two indices of 0"
13359,WB-2014-6.txt,30 is large)
13360,WB-2014-6.txt," If we look at the probabilities of migration in the last five years, this would generate an increase in the probability of resident migration of about one percentage point, while the impact on nonresident migration is not statistically significant"
13361,WB-2014-6.txt," If we look at the data on migration for a longer period, the increase in migration is statistically significant for both resident and nonresident migrations, and it would be at about 1"
13362,WB-2014-6.txt,5 percentage point for both types of migration
13363,WB-2014-6.txt," Given that the overall migration rate in the sample is at about 7­8 percentage points, this increase would not be negligible by any means, and it would represent between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed"
13364,WB-2014-6.txt," This proportion is a bit higher than the share of migrants who declared that droughts and floods were the main reasons to migrate, but this is what we would have expected given that poor climate may also be in part responsible for some of the migrants leaving the households temporarily or permanently in search of better employment opportunities or because of a lack of employment opportunity in their place of origin"
13365,WB-2014-6.txt," Said differently, the findings obtained with the subjective perceptions of the reasons to migrate and the regression analysis of the impact of climate perceptions on migration tend to be broadly coherent"
13366,WB-2014-6.txt,"
What about the impact of losses incurred from adverse weather events? The marginal impact of most losses on migration are not statistically significant, with the exception of losses in assets or livestock, which are associated with a decrease in migration rates of just under two percentage points"
13367,WB-2014-6.txt," This might be related to the fact that the resources needed to facilitate migration by household members may have been weakened (migration, even on a temporary basis, is costly when sending the migrant away, even if it generates additional resources later)"
13368,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A number of other variables have statistically significant effects"
13369,WB-2014-6.txt," In comparison to the reference country (Syria), resident migration rates are higher in Egypt and the Republic of Yemen, and lower in Morocco"
13370,WB-2014-6.txt," For nonresident migration, the rates are again higher in Egypt than in Syria, and lower in Morocco, but the Republic of Yemen rates are also below those observed in Syria"
13371,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Resident migration rates tend not to change much by quintile of well-being"
13372,WB-2014-6.txt," For nonresident migration by contrast, the effects are much larger and statistically significant, with poorer households less likely to have nonresident migrants, probably in part because of the cost of sending one household member away permanently"
13373,WB-2014-6.txt," Landownership above one acre of land--which may be a sign of wealth in rural areas--is associated with a statistically significant increase in permanent migration by household members, while households renting land as tenants are more likely to have some of their members migrate temporarily"
13374,WB-2014-6.txt," The effect of education on resident migration is not systematic, while it is again for resident migration with the better educated much more likely to migrate, a finding that is coherent with the previous comment made about the relationship
between wealth and permanent migration"
13375,WB-2014-6.txt," Self-employed individuals working in agriculture tend to migrate less, and this is observed for both temporary and permanent migration, but those with low employment status (the unemployed, servants and unqualified workers) are more likely to be nonresident migrants, controlling for other household and individual characteristics, probably because of better employment opportunities elsewhere"
13376,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In terms of demographic variables, the effects are as expected as well"
13377,WB-2014-6.txt," Individuals from larger households are more likely to migrate permanently (their labor is likely to be less needed at their place of origin given the presence of other household members), while the effect is smaller and less often statistically significant for resident migration"
13378,WB-2014-6.txt," Another important difference between resident and nonresident migrations is that the likelihood of resident migration is higher for household heads, while for nonresident migration it is higher for other household members, as expected"
13379,WB-2014-6.txt," Both resident and nonresident migration rates are much higher for younger individuals, with the effects being especially large for nonresident migration"
13380,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Conclusion
Migration is one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions as well as extreme weather events"
13381,WB-2014-6.txt," The objective of this chapter was to use new household survey data collected in 2011 in two climate-affected areas of five MENA countries (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen) in order to assess whether perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment are correlated with the decision to migrate by some household members"
13382,WB-2014-6.txt, Both resident (temporary) and nonresident (permanent) migrations were considered
13383,WB-2014-6.txt, Statistical as well as regression analysis were implemented
13384,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Overall, the findings from both the statistical analysis and the regression estimates suggest that socioeconomic and demographic factors today probably play a larger role than climatic factors in the temporary and permanent migration decisions of household members"
13385,WB-2014-6.txt," This is a finding that is coherent with other chapters in this study, some of which use similar analytical methods while others are based on different types of data and approaches"
13386,WB-2014-6.txt,"
However, this does not mean that changes in weather patterns and the environment do not play an important role in migration decisions"
13387,WB-2014-6.txt," When combining the results from the statistical analysis and the regressions, it is legitimate to suggest that climatic events may well account for about 10­20 percent of current levels of migration, which is still large"
13388,WB-2014-6.txt, And the role that weather patterns play could well increase in the future as climatic conditions deteriorate further

13393,WB-2014-6.txt, Rural residents are clearly aware of climate change
13394,WB-2014-6.txt, They perceive a shift in climactic conditions that affects their livelihood due to deteriorating agricultural conditions

Introduction
The MENA region is experiencing warmer temperatures and precipitation levels are falling"
13400,WB-2014-6.txt, Adverse extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity in coming decades
13401,WB-2014-6.txt," As a result of its impact on the environment, climate change has significant effects on economic outcomes"
13402,WB-2014-6.txt, In many MENA countries--including those that are the focus of this study--economic growth and poverty levels are strongly influenced by agriculture and agricultural-related activity
13403,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, about three fourths of Morocco's poor depend on agriculture for their livelihood"
13404,WB-2014-6.txt, This population lives on land with poor agricultural potential which is sensitive to changes in rainfall
13405,WB-2014-6.txt," While agriculture in Morocco represents only one seventh of gross domestic product (GDP), it employs almost half of the labor force"
13406,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A similar pattern is evident in the Republic of Yemen, where agriculture accounts for a similar share of GDP and employs 55 percent of the labor force"
13407,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Arab Republic of Egypt also, agriculture represents only one seventh of GDP, but it employs 55 percent of the labor force"
13408,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Syrian Arab Republic, 45 percent of the population works in agriculture, and the country is on the verge of water poverty, against the backdrop of declining rainfall and a decline in the availability of agricultural land as well as rising temperatures (MSEA 2010; Qabbani 2010; el Atrache 2009)"

13413,WB-2014-6.txt, Migration is indeed a common means of dealing with risks from the environment
13414,WB-2014-6.txt," But the extent to which climate change affects migration is unclear, because migration is affected by multiple push and pull factors"
13415,WB-2014-6.txt," Push factors do include changes in the climate such as warming temperatures, heat waves, declining rainfall, and also floods, among others"
13416,WB-2014-6.txt," These events act as catalysts for migration from rural to urban areas or to other countries, whether temporarily or permanently"
13417,WB-2014-6.txt," This is because climate and subsequent environmental degradation decrease agricultural crop production, as well as livestock or water availability, which adversely affects economic activity"
13418,WB-2014-6.txt, But pull factors that may have nothing to do with climate change also influence migration
13419,WB-2014-6.txt," The existence of economic opportunities such as employment, well-established community networks that help reduce uncertainty and risk, and housing in urban areas may all be variables that pull migrants to a particular area independently of changes in the climate"
13420,WB-2014-6.txt," The possibility of better access to schools, health care, electricity, and possibly clean water and functioning sewage systems in urban areas also influences the decisions of some migrants to leave"
13421,WB-2014-6.txt,"
There is unfortunately a dearth of rigorous analysis on climate change and migration to better understand the impact of climate change on human mobility in the MENA region"
13422,WB-2014-6.txt," This is not only the case for quantitative analysis, but also for qualitative analysis"
13423,WB-2014-6.txt," For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
13424,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al
13425,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014a) in this study
13426,WB-2014-6.txt,"
As a complement to the quantitative analysis conducted in other chapters, the goal of this chapter is to contribute to a more in-depth or ""thicker"" understanding of the complex relationships between climate change, environmental degradation, and migration than is feasible through statistics and (reduced form) econometric analysis"
13427,WB-2014-6.txt," The chapter seeks to illustrate the precarious conditions rural communities face as a result of climate-induced environmental degradation,
identify why potential migrants select--or do not select--various adaptation strategies including that of migration, and describe the challenges household members face once they choose to relocate to urban areas"
13428,WB-2014-6.txt,"
More precisely, this chapter aims to provide answers to a number of questions, each of which addresses various aspects of the relationship between climate change and migration"
13429,WB-2014-6.txt," Among residents in rural areas, what do respondents see as the greatest challenges facing their households? As households attempt to cope with unfavorable agricultural conditions caused by climate change, how prevalent is migration as an adaptive strategy relative to others? To what extent do economic and social burdens differ across gender? What is the role of remittances for rural household productivity and survival? Among urban migrants, key questions include: For those who have opted for migration as an adaptation strategy, to what extent has integration into urban settings been a positive process or a negative one, and why? How important are community networks for reducing uncertainty, such as for providing information, access to employment opportunities, and for facilitating the overall social and economic integration process? To what extent have the expectations of rural migrants been met? And finally, among rural migrants, what is the likelihood of return to rural places of origin?
In order to explore these themes, focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted among both rural residents and urban migrants in the five focus countries--Morocco, Egypt and Syria, and Algeria and the Republic of Yemen (on data collection and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al"
13430,WB-2014-6.txt," 2014a, 2014b)"
13431,WB-2014-6.txt," The participants in focus groups and the individuals who were interviewed were asked about their perceptions of climate change, and their individual views of household circumstances and other factors that shape migration choices and other adaptation strategies"
13432,WB-2014-6.txt," Each of the five countries is subject to climate change and environmental degradation, but not to the same extent"
13433,WB-2014-6.txt," Given variance in historic experiences, domestic institutions, and climate pressures, one would expect that individual attitudes and responses would differ between areas and countries"
13434,WB-2014-6.txt," To some extent, this indeed turned out to be the case, and yet there were many similarities in the experiences shared across countries"
13435,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The chapter is structured as follows"
13436,WB-2014-6.txt," Section two outlines the reasons for conducting qualitative work as part of this study and the approach used here through focus groups, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and interviews with key informants"
13437,WB-2014-6.txt, Section three discusses the findings for sending rural areas
13438,WB-2014-6.txt, Section four does the same for receiving urban areas
13439,WB-2014-6.txt, Section five is touches upon the correspondence between the qualitative results presented in this chapter and some of the results obtained using household surveys in other chapters
13440,WB-2014-6.txt, Section six summarizes some of findings from the interviews with key informants
13441,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
13442,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Rationale for Qualitative Work and Methodology While this study relies mostly on quantitative survey data, it also factors in through this chapter qualitative fieldwork"
13443,WB-2014-6.txt," The combination of quantitative and
qualitative data is important and warranted by the nature of some of the questions being analyzed"
13444,WB-2014-6.txt," Before presenting the qualitative data sources, it is useful to briefly outline some of the reasons that have led to the decision to combine quantitative and qualitative data sources for this study"
13445,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Survey-based and other quantitative methods have long been privileged in the development economics and environmental science literature because of the higher degree of statistical reliability of such data"
13446,WB-2014-6.txt," But qualitative research tools have also proved to be important to identify social issues, assess stakeholder interests and interactions, and identify the many different transmission channels through which exogenous shocks as well as policy interventions may have an impact on individuals and groups"
13447,WB-2014-6.txt," That is, qualitative research and findings have often been found essential to complement the traditional focus on quantitative analysis"
13448,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Quantitative methods based on statistics provide robustness to the results if they rely on appropriate samples, and regression analysis helps to control for a large number of other variables when measuring the impact of a specific variable on a given outcome"
13449,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet quantitative data often cannot fully capture causality, especially when the analysis fails to provide appropriate contextual information"
13450,WB-2014-6.txt, Qualitative methods help to shed light on why people make the decisions they do
13451,WB-2014-6.txt," Qualitative research is often people-centered, and it may include both objective and subjective dimensions, to the degree that it considers both objective conditions for people's lives and their perceptions and feelings about their situation"
13452,WB-2014-6.txt," While this can also be done to some extent with quantitative data, qualitative data often provides a richer context for interpretation"
13453,WB-2014-6.txt,"
An important aspect of qualitative research methods refers to what scholars call research access"
13454,WB-2014-6.txt," While no hasty conclusions should be made about the advantages of qualitative research techniques (respondents may refuse to be interviewed while they may accept to fill in an anonymous questionnaire), such methods are often better suited to address sensitive issues"
13455,WB-2014-6.txt, One example in the case of this study relates to women's perceptions of the implications of climate change and migration
13456,WB-2014-6.txt," In the quantitative survey data collection, in part because of cost constraints, only one person was interviewed in each household, and this was typically the (male) household head"
13457,WB-2014-6.txt," In the focus groups and in-depth interviews, care was taken to interview both men and women, which provides for a better understanding of the point of view of women on climate change and migration issues"
13458,WB-2014-6.txt," This is important given that in the region, migration remains primarily undertaken by men, who may have a different view of its benefits and costs than women"
13459,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, the challenges faced by those women who have migrated need not be the same as those faced by men--the risk of sexual and other forms of harassment is for example much higher for women than it is for men, but the social as opposed to economic opportunities that migration may provide in terms of gaining more freedom is likely to be higher for women"
13460,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Another argument in favor of integrated research methods relates to the potential of complementing quantitative data with actor-oriented perspectives in applied research"
13461,WB-2014-6.txt," An actor-oriented perspective entails the variety of social
practices and at times incompatible worldviews between various actors and the multiple realities to which these practices and worldviews respond"
13462,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of research on climate change and service delivery, key actors would include not only the household members who migrate and those who do not, but also the governmental officials and nongovernmental experts who implement policies and programs in this area"
13463,WB-2014-6.txt, The experience and voice of those affected by climate change as well as the perspective of professionals are often overlooked when relying only on quantitative survey data
13464,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Still another argument in favor of integrated research methods relates to policy making"
13465,WB-2014-6.txt, Qualitative data derived from interviews and focus groups are often criticized for their subjectivity
13466,WB-2014-6.txt," This is a legitimate concern, and it underscores the fact that qualitative research methods must be implemented rigorously by well-trained researchers, with their results ideally supported by further quantitative analysis"
13467,WB-2014-6.txt," But at the same time, policy-oriented social analysis is concerned with change and agency"
13468,WB-2014-6.txt," In such contexts, the subjectivity of the various actors, and how as persons they perceive their situations matters for understanding the basis of agency"
13469,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The qualitative fieldwork for this specific study is especially important because it is the only information available in the study on how well migrants are doing in urban areas"
13470,WB-2014-6.txt, This is because the survey data collection and most of the analysis conducted for the study focused by design on rural sending areas
13471,WB-2014-6.txt," But assessing through qualitative fieldwork how well migrants are doing is crucial to understand what is going on in sending areas, since outcomes for migrants affect through their ability to send remittances how well households are doing back home"
13472,WB-2014-6.txt,"
For example, part of this study suggests that remittances tend to be received less (in probability and in amounts) by households living in climate poor areas, even if though remittances received in those areas are even more crucial than elsewhere to reduce poverty and improve human development indicators"
13473,WB-2014-6.txt, This chapter helps to understand why remittances do not always reach climate poor areas
13474,WB-2014-6.txt," This is probably in part because many urban migrants from those areas have a hard time finding good jobs, so that even if they consider it their moral obligation to send remittances back home, they may not always able to do so"
13475,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, this migration appears to be a strategy of last resort in the areas most affected by droughts and a deteriorating climate, which may also help to explain why households living in those areas are less likely to receive remittances"
13476,WB-2014-6.txt, This could appear counter-intuitive
13477,WB-2014-6.txt," Given that opportunities are scarce in the areas most affected by the changing climate, one would expect high rates of migration away from those areas"
13478,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet once the social context is taken into account, it becomes clear that migration is not necessarily the first choice of migrants in those areas because they have strong personal links with their area of origin that many do not wish to lose through migration (this is however highly context specific and varies between countries)"
13479,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In this chapter, the qualitative findings that are discussed are based on results from focus groups semi-structured in-depth interviews, and interviews with key
informants"
13480,WB-2014-6.txt, A general description of the methodology used for the qualitative analysis is provided in chapter 3 (Burger et al
13481,WB-2014-6.txt, Additional details are given in this section and especially in annexes 8A through 8C to this chapter
13482,WB-2014-6.txt," On focus groups, the original intent was to conduct them in the five countries"
13483,WB-2014-6.txt," But lack of security in the Republic of Yemen made focus group recruitment difficult, and in Algeria focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion"
13484,WB-2014-6.txt," In both countries, this led to a shift toward semi-structured in-depth interviews which provide similarly rich and textured information"
13485,WB-2014-6.txt, The fieldwork was conducted among adults 18 years of age and older in each country between November 2010 and February 2012
13486,WB-2014-6.txt," Results are based on seven focus groups in Morocco, Egypt, and Syria, with each group comprising six to eight participants: four focus groups among urban migrants, who have relocated internally from rural areas; and three focus groups in each rural area among rural residents"
13487,WB-2014-6.txt," In Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as already mentioned, semi-structured interviews were conducted instead"
13488,WB-2014-6.txt," The rural areas for the qualitative work were selected among the sites used for the household survey data collection: M'Sila in Algeria, Lamzoudia in Morocco, Dakhalia in Egypt, al-Hassakeh in Syria, and Hudaydah in the Republic of Yemen"
13489,WB-2014-6.txt," The urban areas were the countries' largest, most populous cities: Algiers, Casablanca, Cairo, Damascus, and Sanaa"
13490,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 8
13491,WB-2014-6.txt,1 summarizes the location of the qualitative research sites
13492,WB-2014-6.txt,"
It was suggested earlier that a key contribution of this chapter to the overall study consists in documenting the living conditions of migrants in urban areas"
13493,WB-2014-6.txt, To what extent is the choice of the cities in table 8
13494,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 appropriate for conducting the focus groups and in-depth interviews? Is it correct to implicitly assume through the choice of these sites for the fieldwork that most migration is toward urban areas, and specifically toward large urban centers, so that the choice of these cities would be appropriate? Table 8"
13495,WB-2014-6.txt,2 provides data from the household surveys collected in the five countries in mostly rural areas affected by adverse weather shocks
13496,WB-2014-6.txt," Those are the data used in several other chapters of the study (chapters 4, 6, and 7)"
13497,WB-2014-6.txt," While those data are not nationally representative, they are representative, or at least illustrative of the weather and migration patterns in some of the areas most affected by climate change
In table 8"
13498,WB-2014-6.txt,2 nonresident migration refers to permanent migration by household members who used to belong to the household but have left
13499,WB-2014-6.txt," Resident migration by contrast is temporary, in that the migrant is still considered by the household as being part of the household in the areas of origin"
13500,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 8
13501,WB-2014-6.txt,"2 suggests that for four of the five countries (due to data issues this analysis cannot be

performed for Algeria), both temporary and permanent migration takes place toward urban areas, especially in the case of nonresidents"
13502,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, for nonresidents the survey questionnaire identifies separately small urban areas and large cities, and clearly migration is taking place mostly toward those large urban centers"
13503,WB-2014-6.txt," Given that the focus in this chapter is on permanent migrants, conducting the interviews in the cities listed table 8"
13504,WB-2014-6.txt,1 seems appropriate
13505,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Discussions in focus groups and in-depth interviews in urban areas were organized around core questions, with probing for specific aspects or subquestions within each of the main question"
13506,WB-2014-6.txt," The same was done in rural areas, but with a different set of questions"
13507,WB-2014-6.txt," Annexes 8A and 8B provide the list of questions used in urban and rural areas, as well as the subtopics on which the focus group leaders and the interviewers (for in-depth interviews) probed participants"
13508,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, key informant interviews were carried with a dozen government officials and a dozen respondents from universities, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in each country"
13509,WB-2014-6.txt, The main questions asked to government officials and nongovernmental experts are listed in Annex 8C
13510,WB-2014-6.txt,"
To understand who participated in the urban focus groups and in-depth interviews, it is important to note that filters were used for the selection of participants"
13511,WB-2014-6.txt," If a migrant came from another urban area, or if s/he had relocated to the present area more than 10 years ago, s/he was not selected in the sample"
13512,WB-2014-6.txt, Only migrants who had relocated because they could not earn a living in rural areas due to poor agricultural conditions or because they needed to migrate to work and help their family were included in the sample
13513,WB-2014-6.txt," Those who said that they migrated because they were tired of their area of origin, because they needed to migrate to go to school or because they missed friends and family relatives who had moved to their urban area were not selected"
13514,WB-2014-6.txt,"

In addition to focus groups and in-depth household interviews where the focus groups could not be implemented, we also relied on interviews with key informants"
13515,WB-2014-6.txt, This is because the ability of countries to adapt--and help affected populations adapt--to climate change depends in part on governance and institutional capacity (Sowers and Weinthal 2010)
13516,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to assess this capacity and the extent to which issues related to climate change and migration were present in the policy and development agenda, interviews were carried with key informants--government officials and nongovernmental experts--in each of the five countries"
13517,WB-2014-6.txt," For the purpose of understanding the decisions to migrate of household members and the consequences, both positive and negative, of such decisions for both migrants and the household back home, the information obtained from key informants was not the most valuable"
13518,WB-2014-6.txt, But that information does help in placing climate-induced migration in a broader context
13519,WB-2014-6.txt," For that reason, we also report as an example the feedback received from key informants in the specific case of Morocco, because for that country key informants were especially knowledgeable about migration flows"
13520,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Focus Groups and In-depth Interviews in Rural (Sending) Areas
Focus group respondents were aware of the shifts taking place in the climate and attribute associated declining agriculture fortunes with deteriorating environmental conditions caused by changing weather patterns"
13521,WB-2014-6.txt," Conditions in rural or ""sending areas"" have become very difficult, according to the vast majority of focus group respondents"
13522,WB-2014-6.txt, Participants complained of fewer days of rainfall and lower irrigation levels
13523,WB-2014-6.txt," For key crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results are devastating"

13525,WB-2014-6.txt," Egyptians, in particular, also cited government expropriation of agricultural land as an obstacle to profitable and sustainable agriculture, though this problem was not mentioned in other countries"
13526,WB-2014-6.txt, Many former rural residents from each country also mentioned the rising costs of seeds and other agricultural inputs
13527,WB-2014-6.txt, Rural residents explained that poor quality of crops mean lower prices for agricultural products and this reduces income
13528,WB-2014-6.txt," While incomes from agricultural activity are decreasing, the prices for essential goods are on the rise, observed most participants"
13529,WB-2014-6.txt, The inability to earn a stable and adequate income from crops implies that relying solely on agricultural activity is not feasible any more
13530,WB-2014-6.txt, The experience shared in box 8
13531,WB-2014-6.txt,1 from a resident in the town of Djelfa in Algeria is one shared by many other focus group participants and respondents in the in-depth interviews

13580,WB-2014-6.txt, Remittances are vital as they may contribute to the health of both household and national economies
13581,WB-2014-6.txt," Remittances appeared especially important for rural focus group respondents from the Republic of Yemen, where a number of participants declared having family members who had migrated internationally, primarily to Persian Gulf countries"

13594,WB-2014-6.txt," More isolated locales are far from their reach, and on the main, bureaucracy and corruption make loan acquisition from formal institutions such as banks a lengthy and frustrating process"

13601,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Government provision of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers was also suggested in addition to the provision of loans to purchase machinery or for livestock breeding"

What about the areas where respondents felt that government and nongovernmental programs might help? Access to health care, education and job training, credit for housing and rental assistance were deemed vital among participants for advancing the integration of rural migrants into urban communities"
13741,WB-2014-6.txt, Some suggestions were also more country specific
13742,WB-2014-6.txt," In Morocco some
respondents complained about not having the appropriate official documents that would enable them to work and receive financial credit: ""Our life is in crisis"

While language was not a problem for focus group respondents from the other countries, Moroccan respondents called for government assistance in French language training"
13747,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Egyptians emphasized the need for government assistance with agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as no-interest loans and credit"

Heterogeneity between Countries in the Reasons for Migration
A quick read of the discussion in the two previous sections could be perceived as simply highlighting common tendencies in the various countries for both urban and rural areas"
13755,WB-2014-6.txt," There are clearly such common tendencies, but one should not underestimate the heterogeneity in the qualitative data and in the underlying circumstances of individuals and households, including in terms of the reasons for migration and how well migrants fare once they have migrated"

13757,WB-2014-6.txt," There are not only differences between individuals and households, but also between areas within any country and between countries in the drivers of migration"
13758,WB-2014-6.txt," Depending on the country, migration may or may not be a strategy of last resort, and the decision to migrate may or may not be closely related to droughts and declining agricultural fortunes at their place of origin"
13759,WB-2014-6.txt, The role of pull versus push factors is likely to be different in the various countries given differences in dynamism and opportunities
13760,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The fact that there are differences between areas and countries actually comes up in the qualitative data presented above"
13761,WB-2014-6.txt," On average, migrants in Morocco, and to some extent also in Egypt, tend to mention more frequently the opportunities that migration may offer at the places of destination in terms of jobs and freedom, while migrants in Syria, and to some extent in Algeria and the Republic of

Yemen, are quicker to relate their decision to migrate to the difficulty to survive in rural areas due to the deteriorating climate, droughts, and low agricultural yields"
13762,WB-2014-6.txt," For triangulation of the results from the study, it is reassuring that these stylized differences between countries in the reasons to migrate obtained from the qualitative work also show up in the quantitative data from the household surveys implemented at the same time and in the same sending areas in the five focus countries (see chapter 3 on data collection)"
13763,WB-2014-6.txt, In the surveys households could provide two reasons for the migration of household members
13764,WB-2014-6.txt, Basic statistics on those reasons to migrate are provided in table 8
13765,WB-2014-6.txt,5 for permanent (nonresident) migration
13766,WB-2014-6.txt,"
For the sample as a whole, the two main reasons to migrate are the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment opportunity in place of origin"
13767,WB-2014-6.txt," Both of these reasons are of course related, but as mentioned in chapter 7, in terms of the language used, the first reason can be associated more with pull factors, while the second can be associated more with push factors"
13768,WB-2014-6.txt," Marriage is also important, especially so in Algeria, but this cannot be related specifically to push or pull factors"
13769,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate and environmental push factors, such as droughts and floods, as well as the poor quality of land or depleted soils are mentioned, but less often, and virtually all mentions of droughts come from Syrian households"
13770,WB-2014-6.txt," Accumulation of savings is another important reason to migrate, and can probably be associated more with pull factors than with push factors, even if one could discuss this (schooling and better infrastructure also relate more to pull factors, although less in terms of direct employment opportunities and livelihood)"
13771,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Dividing the share of the main reasons associated with pull factors with the share of the main reasons associated with push factors yields a simple index that can be compared for the various countries"
13772,WB-2014-6.txt, As shown in table 8
13773,WB-2014-6.txt,"5, the ratio of pull versus push factors is highest in Egypt, where it takes on a value of 3"
13774,WB-2014-6.txt," This makes sense given that Egypt is the country the least affected by droughts, with data from a recent study by the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands and the United Nations Secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Regional Office for Arab States suggesting that only 2"
13775,WB-2014-6.txt,04 percent of the country is vulnerable to droughts (ACSAD and ISDR 2011)
13776,WB-2014-6.txt," The ratio of pull versus push factors in our household surveys is lowest in Syria, where it takes a value of 0"
13777,WB-2014-6.txt,"80, which again makes sense given that Syria is by far the country in our sample the most susceptible to droughts according to the ACSAD-ISDR study (almost two thirds of the country is vulnerable to droughts according to that study), and that it did suffer recently from major droughts that led to substantial displacement"
13778,WB-2014-6.txt," Among the other three countries, the Republic of Yemen has the largest ratio of pull versus push factors, which may be related to the opportunities provided not only by Sanaa but also by neighboring Saudi Arabia"
13779,WB-2014-6.txt," And Morocco has the lowest ratio, which corresponds again well to the fact that after Syria it is among the five focus countries the most susceptible to droughts"
13780,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Interviews with Key Informants: The Example of Morocco
One more piece of empirical evidence was collected for the qualitative fieldwork through interviews with key informants"
13781,WB-2014-6.txt," In all five countries government officials and nongovernmental experts are well aware of the stress caused by changes in climatic conditions, and of the fact that climate change contributes to rural-urban migration flows even if today it is not the main driver of these flows"
13782,WB-2014-6.txt," They also realize that in most cases, the lack of sufficiently ambitious and well-developed policies and programs contributes to the inability to propose concrete solutions and help to those most affected by climate change in rural areas"
13783,WB-2014-6.txt," Many of the comments made by government officials and nongovernmental experts in the various countries were similar, so that rather than provide examples from all countries, it is probably more instructive to cover one country in slightly more depth"
13784,WB-2014-6.txt," This is done in this section for Morocco, because more respondents were either experts on migration or were conducting ongoing research on migration-related issues"
13785,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Key informants in Morocco explained that migration was historically by men and driven by inequitable development in rural areas"
13786,WB-2014-6.txt," The absence of networks in destination areas made women vulnerable to prostitution or slave labor, so they were less likely to migrate than men"
13787,WB-2014-6.txt," Migrants migrated both internationally and internally, in that case principally to Casablanca, which continues to remain as a prime destination for rural migrants since the Greater Casablanca area alone still attracts around 15 percent of all national migration flows in the country"
13788,WB-2014-6.txt, Today territorial units nearby Casablanca have also become preferred destinations for newcomers
13789,WB-2014-6.txt," This is for example the case of Ain Sebaa, Sidi Moumen, Moulay Rachid, Hay Hassani, Mohammedia city, and districts of Sidi Bernoussi and Hay Mohammadi"
13790,WB-2014-6.txt, Migration to other to cities has also picked up as rural migrants are searching for destinations closer to their homes
13791,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Key informants explained that three main features remain central to migratory flows irrespective of origin and destination locations"
13792,WB-2014-6.txt, The first is the importance of networks which play a critical role in providing support to migrant families and in helping them to decide their destinations
13793,WB-2014-6.txt," A second key feature is the importance of the remittances sent by migrants, which are critical not only for household survival in rural areas but also for communities"
13794,WB-2014-6.txt," In Tiznit for example, migrant associations are helping build two thirds of the roads"
13795,WB-2014-6.txt," Several informants also stated that migration facilitated women empowerment in rural areas, as the women who remained in the countryside while their husbands were away working in the cities gained more independence and were also more likely to interact with their neighbors"
13796,WB-2014-6.txt," A third important feature, especially in recent years, has been the role of climatic patterns in internal migration"
13797,WB-2014-6.txt, Drastic changes in climatic conditions have led to an expansion of shanty towns
13798,WB-2014-6.txt," In Tafilelt for example, a fourth of the population has migrated due to climatic hazards that had affected agricultural production"
13799,WB-2014-6.txt," Likewise, in the Draa region which has historically been an important center of trade but more recently has been experiencing frequent and longer droughts, out-migration has increased"
13800,WB-2014-6.txt," In general, informants agree that the so-called Oasis belt is
losing its population as people are becoming increasingly affected by the negative effects of droughts"
13801,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Outgoing migration is primarily stemming from the water crisis that Morocco is experiencing"
13802,WB-2014-6.txt," Six of our respondents mentioned water as a major issue, in part due to more droughts, but also with flooding in some areas"
13803,WB-2014-6.txt," For example the Tafilalt region, one of the most important oasis regions in the country, has suffered from severe droughts and flooding which in turn have undermined the oasis agriculture"
13804,WB-2014-6.txt," While droughts used to occur every four to five years, they now occur every two years"
13805,WB-2014-6.txt, Climatic hazards are also leading to severe desertification in the Sahara region
13806,WB-2014-6.txt," Rising sea water levels are also a concern, among others in Saadia were tourism may have contributed to destroying plant life and consequently making the land vulnerable"
13807,WB-2014-6.txt, A respondent suggested that 60 percent of Saadi may soon be under water
13808,WB-2014-6.txt,"
These severe climatic conditions have had a large impact on rural populations, with farmers experiencing increased water scarcity with no access to water reserves"
13809,WB-2014-6.txt, Women have to travel much further away to get water
13810,WB-2014-6.txt," Some respondents were convinced that agricultural yields will fall by 20 percent in 20 years, which drive more migrants from rural areas toward urban centers"
13811,WB-2014-6.txt, Life in the cities will then become difficult for both locals and migrants
13812,WB-2014-6.txt, Many respondents mentioned ongoing housing and employment crises in urban areas
13813,WB-2014-6.txt," As locals and migrants compete for survival, integration will become a major problem and economic discrimination will rise, as may black markets and the informal economy"
13814,WB-2014-6.txt," In large cities such as Casablanca, many migrants are already found to be living in shanty towns"
13815,WB-2014-6.txt, The pressures of living in cities along with influences from urban lifestyles have also been weakening social structures between migrants and their families which may have severe consequences for those still living in Morocco's rural areas
13816,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In recognition of these challenges, respondents explained that the Moroccan government launched initiatives at both the national and local levels"
13817,WB-2014-6.txt," One such initiative is a higher focus on rural development programs, among others, through the Human Development Initiative (HDI) which is designed to target vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas"
13818,WB-2014-6.txt," At the local level, the government is also conducting awareness programs to inform people about climate change"
13819,WB-2014-6.txt," The objective is to teach people about conservation and preservation of water resources, disaster preparedness to limit the negative effects of droughts, and different irrigation schemes to encourage the agricultural sector to become independent of water resources"
13820,WB-2014-6.txt, Climate change has also been included as a key component in other initiatives such as Morocco Green and the Communal Development Plan
13821,WB-2014-6.txt," There is also an Energy Strategy Plan being initiated, and work is ongoing toward an insurance plan named `Natural Catastrophe Insurance"
13822,WB-2014-6.txt,' Active research programs are also on-going in a few universities
13823,WB-2014-6.txt," Despite these initiatives, respondents perceived some fatalism, with many believing that everything is happening because of Allah's will"
13824,WB-2014-6.txt, And at times government programs may contribute to the issues
13825,WB-2014-6.txt," One respondent mentioned a dam which instead of stopping flooding drained water resources from the ground, leading to poor water quality and affecting surrounding palm trees"
13826,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Conclusion
Adverse weather trends such as increased flooding and droughts shape the decisions to migrate made by household and individuals"
13827,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate change is widely perceived to reduce crop yields and livestock production, decrease water availability, reduce fishing populations, and limit opportunities in rural areas that depend heavily on agriculture"
13828,WB-2014-6.txt," The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between climate change, environmental degradation, deterioration of agriculture, and human mobility, through an exploration of the attitudes of rural residents and urban migrants in our five focus countries"
13829,WB-2014-6.txt," Rural residents use a range of coping mechanisms to survive, ranging from eating less and borrowing money to selling livestock and other assets"
13830,WB-2014-6.txt," Remittances are also important for survival, and when this source of income is insufficient, additional household members are forced to migrate to other areas in search of better opportunities"
13831,WB-2014-6.txt," Overall, while in some countries such as Egypt and to some extent Morocco, there is a perception that migration opens up new opportunities, in other countries such as Syria, for many migrants migration may be a strategy of last resort than a real choice"
13832,WB-2014-6.txt," While such differences between countries seem to emerge from the qualitative fieldwork, and tend to also be supported by quantitative household survey data, of course individual situations remain highly household and area specific within each of the five countries"
13833,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The qualitative work also suggests that for urban migrants, the arduous task of obtaining a job is further hindered by corruption and fierce competition with locals for limited employment opportunities"
13834,WB-2014-6.txt," Social dislocation is a risk, with many migrants feeling inferior, alienated, and different in their new urban environs"
13835,WB-2014-6.txt," Many face job discrimination, harassment, and exploitation at the hands of their supervisors and would-be employers"
13836,WB-2014-6.txt," Poor housing conditions, rising food and rent prices, and the obligation to send remittances back home place substantial pressure on urban migrants"
13837,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet, these coexist alongside some benefits"
13838,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, migrants appreciate the independence, social outlets, and opportunities that urban life has to offer"
13839,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A number of suggestions were made by households as well as migrants about the types of programs that could be of help to them, in both urban and rural areas"
13840,WB-2014-6.txt," It is not the place in this chapter to comment on whether such recommendations are appropriate, or even feasible to implement by governments"
13841,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to come up with such an assessment, a much more detailed analysis of the types of programs proposed, their cost and their benefits, would be required"
13842,WB-2014-6.txt," But what does emerge from the interviews with key informants is that while government officials and nongovernmental experts are aware of the consequences of climate change and extreme weather events for the population, they also recognize that the extent to which governments are dealing with these issues today is limited"
13843,WB-2014-6.txt," This is a finding that is also emerging from other chapters in this study, in that both the community level responses and government programs and policies not only to cope with weather shocks but also to adapt to climate change, remain insufficient"

CHAPTER 9
Is Climate Change Likely to Lead to Higher Net Internal Migration? The Republic of Yemen's Case
George Joseph, Quentin Wodon, Andrea Liverani, and Brian Blankespoor

Concerns abound about the potential impact of climate change on future migration, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, one of the regions that is likely to suffer the most from climate change"
13845,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet it is not clear whether so far climate patterns have been a key driver of internal migration in countries such as the Republic of Yemen, despite the pressures created by water scarcity"
13846,WB-2014-6.txt," By combining data from the Republic of Yemen's latest census and a weather database as well as other geographic information, we analyze the determinants of past net internal migration rates"
13847,WB-2014-6.txt," Next, using future climate change scenarios, we predict the potential impact of rising temperatures on future net internal migration rates"
13848,WB-2014-6.txt," The results suggest that while climate does have an impact on net internal migration rates, this impact is limited, so that on the basis of past patterns of climate and migration, rising temperature may not have a large impact on future net internal migration"
13849,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
Climate change is likely to lead to substantial migration flows (for a recent review of the evidence to-date, see Foresight 2011)"
13850,WB-2014-6.txt," Jakobeit and Methmann (2007) suggested some years back that there may be up to 150­200 million environmental refuges in 30 years, but this estimate was considered as conservative by the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (2006) and the Foresight report notes that 42 million people were displaced by natural hazards just in 2010"
13851,WB-2014-6.txt," It is also clear that the impact of climate change may be very different on different types of households depending on their coping mechanisms (see Meze-Hausken 2004, on Ethiopia) and that the magnitude of migration flows will depend on country conditions"
13852,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, fast onset disasters such as hurricanes and floods, as well as droughts or decreasing agricultural yields may lead to only temporary displacement (for country case studies, see Findley 1994; Haug 2002; Henry, Schoumaker, and Beauchemin 2004; Paul 2005; Shuaizhang

et al"
13853,WB-2014-6.txt," forthcoming; see also Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl 2006), while slow onset events such as desertification or rising sea levels may take longer to occur but may also have longer lasting effects on net migration flows"
13854,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is likely to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, both due to a number of cities threatened by rising sea levels and the vulnerability of agricultural production given water scarcity which is expected to increase further"
13855,WB-2014-6.txt," Average temperatures in many MENA countries may increase by two degrees Celsius by the end of the century, including in the Republic of Yemen, a country where the depletion of groundwater resources is likely to reduce agricultural output by 40 percent (World Bank 2010; for a review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
13856,WB-2014-6.txt, [2014] and chapter 2 on the focus countries for this work by Burger et al
13857,WB-2014-6.txt, [2014] in this study)
13858,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In a country like the Republic of Yemen, climate change is likely lead to higher migration principally due to the need for households to improve their livelihoods"
13859,WB-2014-6.txt," But many households also tend to be fairly attached to their area of origin, and when they move, this is typically driven more by socioeconomic factors than climate variables, as shown by Joseph and Wodon (2013) using a gravity-type model with census data on internal migration rates combined with data on weather patterns at the district level"
13860,WB-2014-6.txt," Building on Joseph and Wodon (2013), we consider in this chapter net migration rates (as opposed to bi-directional flows) and predict to what extent changes in climate are likely to affect such net internal migration flows"
13861,WB-2014-6.txt," We focus on net migration rates because from a policy point of view, these are likely to be more important than overall bi-directional flows"
13862,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The results suggest that controlling for other factors that may affect net internal migration rates, these rates tend to be lower toward areas with higher temperatures, but the impact of temperature on net migration rates, while statistically significant, is small"
13863,WB-2014-6.txt," Using predicted values for future temperatures under alternative climate change scenarios, out-of-sample predictions of expected net international migration rates suggest limited changes in patterns of migration due to rising temperatures"
13864,WB-2014-6.txt," It should be emphasized however that because we rely on past patterns of migration and climate, our results can only be considered as suggesting (in an imperfect and indicative way) that slowly changing climate patterns may affect migration in the not too distant future in a limited way only, but they should not be relied upon to assess how structural breaks such as dramatic changes in climate patterns may affect long-term migration"
13865,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The chapter is organized as follows"
13866,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two presents our data and methodology
13867,WB-2014-6.txt, Section three describes our results
13868,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
13869,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Data and Methodology
Net internal migration rates are obtained at the district level from the latest the Republic of Yemen census implemented in 2004"
13870,WB-2014-6.txt," The census has information on 2,752,629 households with 19,708,760 individuals living in 333 districts"
13871,WB-2014-6.txt," It provides information on the current residence, previous residence and place of birth
of all individuals living in the Republic of Yemen at the time of the census"
13872,WB-2014-6.txt," Information is also available on the number of years each individual has been living in the current residence, which along with age enables us to compute net internal migration rates for different age cohorts"
13873,WB-2014-6.txt," For each cohort, we have 333 observations corresponding to the 333 districts in the Republic of Yemen (as of the administrative structure in 2004)"
13874,WB-2014-6.txt," Considering seven cohorts corresponding to age groups defined at five years of interval for the population aged 20­54, this provides us with 2,331 observations"
13875,WB-2014-6.txt," The census also provides demographic and socioeconomic information including the level of education of the population, its occupation and employment characteristics, and the extent of urbanization"
13876,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, we also have at our disposal poverty estimates at the district level that were obtained through the combination of household and survey data through the poverty mapping technique (see Elbers et al"
13877,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In addition, information on the distance between major cities in each district is calculated from the highest population center in each district to all other districts using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9"
13878,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 software, and the same procedure is used for distance to the coast"
13879,WB-2014-6.txt," Travel time to the nearest city with 100,000 populations uses a methodology developed from Nelson (2008) with regionally specific information (World Bank 2011)"
13880,WB-2014-6.txt, The road data provide kilometers of asphalt roads
13881,WB-2014-6.txt, The mean slope of district land is derived from a global dataset by Verdin et al
13882,WB-2014-6.txt, The percentage of irrigated land is taken from Global Map of Irrigated Areas version 4 (Siebert et al
13883,WB-2014-6.txt," 2005; Siebert, Hoogeveen, and Frenken 2006)"
13884,WB-2014-6.txt, Weather data on annual mean temperature and rainfall and their variability are collected from BIOCLIM (Busby 1991)
13885,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Denoting by Yi the net internal migration rate to district to as a proportion of the population of the district, and by Xi the characteristics of the district, we estimate a standard regression using a fractional logit model:

Normalized weights pk are obtained by dividing sk by R2 so that each weight is expressed as fraction of the percentage of total explained variance and the
weights sum to 100"
13886,WB-2014-6.txt," Five slightly different specifications are used to test for the

robustness of the coefficient estimates"
13887,WB-2014-6.txt," The first model or baseline specification does not include dummy variables for the governorates (the administrative level immediately above the district), and it includes the climate variables in both levels and squared values"
13888,WB-2014-6.txt," In the second model, governorate dummy variables are added (although not shown in the regression table--these estimates are available upon request)"
13889,WB-2014-6.txt," Next, in the third specification we keep the governorate dummies, but do not include the quadratic terms for the climate variables"
13890,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In the last two specifications, we also keep the governorate dummies, but we replace the climate variables that measure seasonality by three intervals each including one third of the districts, with the ""low"" interval (in terms of temperature or rainfall) being the excluded reference category in the regression, and the other two intervals being included as dummy variables"
13891,WB-2014-6.txt," The reason to do so is that for the predictive analysis, while we do have estimates of future temperature and rainfall from climate change models, we do not have estimates of future seasonality in temperature and rainfall that are as reliable"
13892,WB-2014-6.txt," At the same time, it is unlikely that for most districts changes in seasonality would be so dramatic as to shift the interval of seasonality to which a district belongs"
13893,WB-2014-6.txt, Then the last two models can then be considered as the best models for out-of-sample predictions of the potential impact of higher temperatures and lower rainfall on future net internal migration rates
13894,WB-2014-6.txt," The difference between the last two models is that one includes squared values for mean temperature and rainfall, while the other does not"
13895,WB-2014-6.txt,"
For the predictions of future migration under likely future climate patterns, we rely on data from Strzepek and Schlosser (2010)"
13896,WB-2014-6.txt, These data provide expected percent changes in temperature and precipitation for the years 2030 (defined as the average for the period 2026­35) and 2050 (defined as the average for the period 2046­55) on a monthly basis in comparison to the model baseline (1961­ 90) which are historical data from the CRU TS 2
13897,WB-2014-6.txt,1 (Mitchell and Jones 2005)
13898,WB-2014-6.txt," Strzepek and Schlosser define three scenarios (Wet, Mid, and Dry) using a Climate Moisture Index (CMI), which is an indicator of the aridity of a region"
13899,WB-2014-6.txt, The CMI depends on the average annual precipitation and average annual potential evapotranspiration (PET)
13900,WB-2014-6.txt," The Wet scenario is defined as the global climate model (GCM) that has the largest increase in average CMI over the baseline period, while the Dry scenario is defined as the GCM that has the largest decrease in average CMI over the baseline period"
13901,WB-2014-6.txt, The Mid scenario is defined as the GCM closest to the mid-point between the Wet and Dry scenarios
13902,WB-2014-6.txt," Since GCMs vary in spatial resolution, the results are coerced to the CRU half degree by half degree resolution and then summarized by district"
13903,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Results
Table 9"
13904,WB-2014-6.txt,1 provides basic statistics on the main variables of interest
13905,WB-2014-6.txt, Net internal migration rates are not very large
13906,WB-2014-6.txt, They range from -2
13907,WB-2014-6.txt,86 percent to 0
13908,WB-2014-6.txt,37 percent
13909,WB-2014-6.txt," The fact that the rates are larger in negative values suggest that net internal migration on average tends to take place from districts with smaller populations to districts with larger populations, as expected"
13910,WB-2014-6.txt, Table 9
13911,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 also provides summary
statistics for the independent variables used in the regression"
13912,WB-2014-6.txt, The summary statistics show that the Republic of Yemen's population still lives predominantly in rural areas with an average urban population across districts of about 20 percent
13913,WB-2014-6.txt, Trade and services provide employment to 42 percent of the employed
13914,WB-2014-6.txt," Education levels tend to be low, with 17 percent of the population above 40 years of age being literate"
13915,WB-2014-6.txt," The share of irrigated land is also low, at only 4 percent"
13916,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Mean temperatures are relatively high, but not excessive at 22 degrees Celsius"
13917,WB-2014-6.txt," Precipitations are low, at 200 millimeters per year on average"
13918,WB-2014-6.txt, Temperature and precipitation seasonality are high

CHAPTER 10
Extreme Weather Events and Migration: The Case of Morocco
Minh Cong Nguyen and Quentin Wodon

Do extreme weather events such as droughts or floods lead to migration away from the areas affected by these events? This chapter aims to provide an answer to that question for Morocco using a new nationally representative household survey implemented in 2009/10"
13954,WB-2014-6.txt, The data suggest that around one in four households have been affected by weather shocks in the five years preceding the survey implementation
13955,WB-2014-6.txt," Droughts and floods are not directly identified by households as major reasons for migration, but insufficient agricultural revenue and a lack of agricultural employment as well as better employment opportunities at the place of destination are mentioned as reasons to migrate, and these are affected by adverse weather shocks"
13956,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, in regression analysis, after controlling for a wide range of individual and household characteristics, the probability of both temporary and permanent migration increases if the household has been affected by an adverse weather shock or the consequences thereof"
13957,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, while adverse weather events may not be the main driver of migration, they do contribute to it"
13958,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
The frequency of droughts has increased in Morocco over the last few decades, with negative impact on farmers and the economy as a whole (Azzam and Sekkat 2005; Barakat and Handoufe 1998; Skees 2001)"
13959,WB-2014-6.txt," Most agricultural land is not irrigated, which means that affected households often have limited ways to reduce the impact of droughts on their livelihood (Skees 2001; Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000)"
13960,WB-2014-6.txt," In chapter 5 of this study, a recent national household survey for Morocco was used to document the extent to which Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, are confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts"
13961,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis suggested that most households working in agriculture were affected by weather shocks, often seriously"
13962,WB-2014-6.txt," In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected was about one fourth, simply because households not in agriculture were not likely
to be affected"
13963,WB-2014-6.txt, Many households affected declared not being able to recover from these shocks
13964,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Given the high level of vulnerability of households to weather shocks and their limited means to cope with the shocks and adapt to climate change, one might expect that weather shocks would contribute to out-migration in the affected areas"
13965,WB-2014-6.txt," It would make sense that some household members would leave the areas most affected by drought, and there is indeed some evidence to this effect"
13966,WB-2014-6.txt," After a severe drought in 2007, two thirds of the illegal migrants arrested in Spain were from the farming and mining region of Khouribga (EACH-FOR 2008)"
13967,WB-2014-6.txt," Another study by Hamza, El Faskaoui, and Fermin (2009) found that environmental degradation was one of the reasons leading to past or intended migration"
13968,WB-2014-6.txt," Yet these studies have been fairly localized and based on small samples, so that it is difficult to generalize from them--for example the study by Hamza, El Faskaoui and Fermin has a sample size of 30, so that it is unclear at the national level whether climate shocks are a major or relatively small factor affecting migration"
13969,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The objective of this chapter is to test whether these weather shocks indeed contribute to migration, both temporary and permanent, by using a broader sample (for a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al"
13970,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014) and chapter 2 on the focus countries for this work by Burger et al
13971,WB-2014-6.txt, (2014) in this study
13972,WB-2014-6.txt, The analysis is based on a nationally representative household survey? the Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented between December 2009 and March 2010
13973,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the questionnaire of that survey focuses on issues critical to youth, such as the obstacles they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation"
13974,WB-2014-6.txt, But the questionnaire also included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks
13975,WB-2014-6.txt, One of the shocks is that of adverse weather events (such as droughts and floods)
13976,WB-2014-6.txt, It is thus feasible using econometric techniques to assess whether households who were affected by extreme weather events experienced higher migration rates among their members after controlling for a range of other household and individual characteristics
13977,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The chapter is organized as follows"
13978,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two introduces the data used for the analysis
13979,WB-2014-6.txt," Section three provides basic statistics on the extent to which households are affected by weather and other shocks, and on the extent of both temporary and permanent migration among household members"
13980,WB-2014-6.txt, Section four then provides the multivariate analysis of the correlates of temporary and permanent migration among household members
13981,WB-2014-6.txt, A brief conclusion follows
13982,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Data
As was the case for chapter 5 of this study, this chapter is based on data from MHYS implemented in 2009/10"
13983,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey is nationally representative (even if it does not include the scarcely populated Western Sahara southern part of the country) and it includes data on 2,000 households (1,216 in urban areas and 784

in rural areas)"
13985,WB-2014-6.txt, The survey was implemented with funding from the World Bank between December 2009 and March 2010
13986,WB-2014-6.txt," Much of the questionnaire focused on issues critical to youth, and especially the obstacles that they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation"
13987,WB-2014-6.txt, Questions were also asked about young people's intentions to emigrate
13988,WB-2014-6.txt, Other more traditional modules deal with standard questions on household member demographics and education as well as employment information
13989,WB-2014-6.txt," The questionnaire also focused on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks, including weather shocks"
13990,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to be able to use the survey for this work on migration in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, additional questions as well as more options within existing questions were added to the questionnaire on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions"
13991,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Apart from a range of household and individual characteristics which are used as controls in the regression analysis, a few central questions are used for the analysis presented in this chapter"
13992,WB-2014-6.txt," In section 6A about the incidence of shocks and household responses, households are asked whether since November 2004, the respondent or a member of the household experienced various shocks"
13993,WB-2014-6.txt," The shocks listed are: (1) Weather shocks (Droughts; floods; Pest infestation, crop and livestock diseases); (2) Unexpected increase in prices of food or other essential commodities consumed; (3) Unexpected loss of job; (4) Involuntary reduction in employment or the number of hours worked; (5) Unexpected decline in prices or demand for products that you sell; (6) Unexpected increase in prices or shortages of inputs or products needed for your activity; (7) Loss of asset or of livestock due to theft, death, or accident; (8) Cut-off or decrease in remittances to household; (9) Death of main earner for the household; (10) Death of another member of the family; (11) Serious injury or illness that kept any member from doing normal activities; (12) Divorce or abandonment by husband; (13) Big amount of dowry for daughter's marriage; (14) Other (specify)"
13994,WB-2014-6.txt, This is the information used in the regression analysis to assess the impact of weather shocks on migration controlling for a range of other independent variables
13995,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Data on migration is available for all household members, both those who remain today members of the households, and those who used to be members but have left permanently"
13996,WB-2014-6.txt, We can thus measure both temporary and permanent migration by household members
13997,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, we only record the migration of household members, as opposed to that of whole households, but this should not be too much of a problem given that most migration is typically undertaken by household members, instead of entire households"
13998,WB-2014-6.txt," It must also be recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate shortterm versus long-term household responses"
13999,WB-2014-6.txt," What the questionnaire provides us with is information on whether households declare having been affected by a weather shock--but the decision to migrate is probably based on repeated shocks or changing conditions, as opposed to a single shock, and we cannot verify to what extent the declarations of households correspond closely to actual weather data for their area"
14000,WB-2014-6.txt," But on the other hand one could argue that decisions such as
that of migrating are influenced at least as much by perceptions of households of weather patterns as by the weather patterns themselves"
14001,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While all households respond to the question of whether they suffered from a weather shock, in a separate part of the questionnaire households working in agriculture are asked whether they were faced with a number problems in the last five years"
14002,WB-2014-6.txt," The list of problems identified was as follows: (1) Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (periodic and recurrent water scarcity due to droughts); (2) Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (too much rain or flooding); (3) Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields; (4) Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (that is, too hot, too cold, too rainy, too dry); (5) Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields; (6) Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector; (7) Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions; (8) Reduction in the stock of livestock since the availability of grazing land is becoming less due to droughts and floods"
14003,WB-2014-6.txt," Next households were asked: ""How serious was the financial loss to the household due to these climate related factors listed above?"" The potential answers were very serious, moderate, serious, and negligible"
14004,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally households were asked ""Was (the household) forced to change the economic activity after the shock?"" This information will also be used in the regression analysis as some problems encountered by agricultural households-- who tend to be more exposed to climate shocks--may lead to migration and the problems identified in the questionnaire may potentially better capture changes in structural environmental conditions than a weather shock would"
14005,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Basic Statistics
Table 10"
14006,WB-2014-6.txt,1 provides summary statistics on the main variables of interest
14007,WB-2014-6.txt, The first two columns of the table give the migration rates observed for the various groups of households or individuals
14008,WB-2014-6.txt," The last two tables provide the summary statistics for the same variables as they are used in the regression analysis--note that in a number of cases the summary statistics are missing and replaced by the symbol ""--"" because these are the excluded reference categories in the regressions (the shares of those with that dummy variable can be readily computed from the other shares for the corresponding category of variables)"
14009,WB-2014-6.txt," In what follows, we focus the discussion of the basic statistics on the migration rates, while the summary statistics are provided simply for the sake of completeness in information and standard practice"
14010,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The temporary migration rate is at 5"
14011,WB-2014-6.txt,"71 percent for the sample as a whole, and is a bit higher than the permanent migration rate, at 4"
14012,WB-2014-6.txt,00 percent
14013,WB-2014-6.txt," The temporary migration rate is at its highest level among individuals aged 25­34, while for permanent migration, the rate is highest among those aged 15­24"
14014,WB-2014-6.txt," The older an individual gets, the less likely it is that s/he will migrate"
14015,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration rates are much higher for women than for men, and this is confirmed when looking at the position of the individual in terms of being a head of household or a spouse (rates for spouses are much higher), or at the interaction effects between gender and marital status"
14016,WB-2014-6.txt,"
In general, and especially in the case of permanent migration, migration rates are higher among the better educated"
14017,WB-2014-6.txt," This is observed whether one looks at the education level of the individuals, or at that of the household heads"
14018,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration rates also tend to be higher among households whose heads is self-employed, which would include small business owners"
14019,WB-2014-6.txt," There are also higher among individuals belonging to a household with little hand, possibly because there is less pressure to stay at the place of origin in order to work the land"
14020,WB-2014-6.txt," Temporary migration is especially high among poorer households as measured through an index of wealth, while permanent migration is slightly higher among both the bottom and the top quintiles"
14021,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Migration rates are higher among household located in urban areas, which may indicate substantial migration from smaller to larger areas as well as international migration from urban centers"
14022,WB-2014-6.txt, There are also large differences in migration rates depending of the regions where households live
14023,WB-2014-6.txt," The highest temporary migration rate is observed in Souss-Massa-Draâ,, followed by Marrakech-TensiftAl Haouz, Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate, Doukala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, and Gharb-Cherarda-Béni Hssen"
14024,WB-2014-6.txt," For permanent migration, the highest rates are observed from Tadla-Azilal, Méknès-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa-Draâ,, and GuélmimEs Semara"
14025,WB-2014-6.txt,"
When looking at migration rates according to whether households have been exposed to weather and other types of shocks, it is remarkable to note that migration rates are essentially always higher among households who were not affected by negative shocks"
14026,WB-2014-6.txt," This does not mean that shocks, including weather shocks, may not be correlated with migration in a multivariate setting, but it does suggest that overall, in the country as a whole, much of the migration that is taking place may not be primarily related to weather shocks"
14027,WB-2014-6.txt,"
A similar message emerges from the data provided in table 10"
14028,WB-2014-6.txt,2 on the reasons declared by households for the migration of household members
14029,WB-2014-6.txt," For temporary migration, the main motivation by far is the fact that better offers of agriculture employment are available at the place of destination-this is the rationale for half of all temporary migrants"
14030,WB-2014-6.txt," The same reason is mentioned for permanent migration, although in that case marriage is mentioned more often"
14031,WB-2014-6.txt," The lack of jobs at the place of origin is mentioned, and it could be related to adverse weather conditions"
14032,WB-2014-6.txt, It could also be that the availability of better agricultural employment at the place of destination is related to the effect of climate change and droughts at the place of origin
14033,WB-2014-6.txt," But this cannot simply be assumed given that being a victim of a drought or a flood is explicitly listed among the potential reasons to migrate in the questionnaire, and that very few households declare that these were the main reasons for the migration decisions of their members"
14034,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Correlates of the Probability of Migration The basic statistics presented in the previous section appear to suggest that migration rates are lower in areas affected by extreme weather shocks"
14035,WB-2014-6.txt, This does not mean however that weather shocks have a negative impact on migration
14036,WB-2014-6.txt," For
xample, a positive association was found between education and the likelihood of migration"
14037,WB-2014-6.txt," If migration is lower among households affected by weather and other shocks, this might simply reflect the fact that these households tend to live in rural areas, work in agriculture, and be less well educated"
14038,WB-2014-6.txt," Controlling for education, it could very well be that weather shocks could have a positive effect on migration"
14039,WB-2014-6.txt," In order to assess the marginal impact of weather and other shocks on migration after controlling for a range of individual and household characteristics, this section provides a regression analysis of the likelihood of temporary and permanent migration in a multivariate setting"
14040,WB-2014-6.txt," The analysis is still descriptive, but it enables us to assess whether controlling for individual and household characteristics as well as broad levels of geographic location, adverse weather shocks have a statistically significant effect on migration, whether positive or negative"
14041,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Table 10"
14042,WB-2014-6.txt,3 provides the results of probit regressions (with robust standard errors) for the correlates of the probability of migrating either temporarily or permanently
14043,WB-2014-6.txt," Note that in the case of permanent migration, only migration for reasons not related to marriage is considered"
14044,WB-2014-6.txt," Two different specifications for the model are provided-- the second specification includes a series of additional household level variables which are not included in the first because of the risk of endogeneity with those variables in that, for example, migration may affect who is considered as the household head, or the education level of the household head"
14045,WB-2014-6.txt," This risk of endogeneity is much larger in the case of permanent migration, but for comparison purposes the two models are estimated for both regressions"
14046,WB-2014-6.txt," Marginal effects are provided (dF/dX), so that a value of 0"
14047,WB-2014-6.txt,02 would represent an increase in the likelihood of migration of two percentage points
14048,WB-2014-6.txt,"

The main variables of interest are at the bottom of table 10"
14049,WB-2014-6.txt,"3, and we start the discussion with those"
14050,WB-2014-6.txt," Being subject to an adverse weather shock appears to increase the probability of temporary migration depending on the specification, but not the probability of permanent migration"
14051,WB-2014-6.txt," It looks like household members are coping with weather shocks (which might be one-time events) by looking for work elsewhere, but that these conditions do not yet lead to permanent departures"
14052,WB-2014-6.txt," However, a reduction in agricultural yields due to less water increases permanent migration, suggesting that when the changes in environmental conditions are perceived to be more permanent, some household members do feel the need to migrate permanently"
14053,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, a reduction in agricultural yields du
to excess water (probably through floods) reduces the likelihood of migrating temporarily, possibly because the shocks may reduce the resources available to household members to migrate, and such shocks are not as likely to be perceived as permanent changes in conditions that affect long-term livelihood"
14054,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Unexpected increases in prices of food and others basic commodities also lead to more temporary migration, but the effect is only marginally significant in one of the two specifications, so one could argue that there is no clear effect"
14055,WB-2014-6.txt," Finally, the largest effect on both temporary and permanent migration comes from being affected by a cut-off or decrease in remittances from previous household members who had migrated"
14056,WB-2014-6.txt," This decrease in remittances leads to a large increase in both types of migration, suggesting a certain level of dependence on remittances among the households receiving them since they send other members away when this is the case (note that the ability to send new members away may be facilitated by network effects that having other members who migrated before entail)"
14057,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Apart from shocks, a number of individual level characteristics affect the probability of migration"
14058,WB-2014-6.txt," Younger individuals are more likely to migrate permanently, given that they have often not yet created a household at the place of origin, but age does not affect the probability of temporary migration in the same way"
14059,WB-2014-6.txt," Better educated individuals appear to be more likely to migrate temporarily, but not permanently"
14060,WB-2014-6.txt," Those who are married are more likely to migrate temporarily, but this is essentially the case for men who are heads of households, while married head are less likely to migrate permanently"
14061,WB-2014-6.txt," As to household level characteristics, temporary migration is more frequent among members for the poorest households (bottom quintile of wealth), but the differences are less systematic for permanent migration"
14062,WB-2014-6.txt, Whether households own more than one acre of land or not does not make much difference after controlling for other variables
14063,WB-2014-6.txt, Households where the head does not have work are more likely to have temporary migrants
14064,WB-2014-6.txt,"
While the urban versus rural location of the household does not have a statistically significant impact on the probability to migrate, there are geographic effects at work after controlling for individual and household characteristics"
14065,WB-2014-6.txt," The reference geographic location in the regression model is the prefecture of TangerTéÈtouhan, which is located in the tip of the northern part of the country toward Spain"
14066,WB-2014-6.txt," In comparison to that region, temporary migration is lower in Oriental, Grand-Casablanca, Méknès-Tafilalet, and Fès-Boulemane, and higher in SoussMassa-Draâ,"
14067,WB-2014-6.txt," Again in comparison to Tanger-Tétouhan, permanent migration is lower in Chaouia-Ouardigha, Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz, and Fès-Boulemane, and higher in Tadla-Azilal"

Conclusion
Do extreme weather events such as droughts or floods lead to migration away from the areas affected by these events in Morocco? The analysis presented in this chapter suggests that this is the case"
14069,WB-2014-6.txt," While droughts and floods are not directly identified by households as major reasons for migration, the characteris-
tics of areas affected by droughts, such as insufficient agricultural revenue and employment are mentioned as reasons for migration by households"
14070,WB-2014-6.txt," Furthermore, in regression analysis, being subject to an adverse weather shock appears to increase the probability of temporary migration, and a reduction in agricultural yields due to less water (droughts) increases permanent migration"
14071,WB-2014-6.txt," Other factors do have a larger effect on the probability of migration, so that climate and environment related variables may not be the main drivers of temporary and permanent migration"
14072,WB-2014-6.txt, But they do appear to contribute to migration

CHAPTER 11
Do Remittances Reach Households Living in Unfavorable Climate Areas? Evidence from the Republic of Yemen
George Joseph, Quentin Wodon, and Brian Blankespoor

There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms"
14074,WB-2014-6.txt, It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks
14075,WB-2014-6.txt," This chapter uses a nationally representative household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received"
14076,WB-2014-6.txt," We are interested in testing whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances"
14077,WB-2014-6.txt, The results suggest that this does not seem to be the case in the Republic of Yemen
14078,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Introduction
Cross-country and country studies suggest that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate and other shocks, with remittances helping households to cope with the effect of the shocks (World Bank 2006)"
14079,WB-2014-6.txt," While private international capital flows tend to dry up after such shocks, remittance flows tend to increase or at least remain stable after natural disasters, as well as macroeconomic or financial crises and armed conflicts (for example, Clarke and Wallsten 2004; Weiss, Fagen and Bump 2005; World Bank 2006)"
14080,WB-2014-6.txt," Yang (2007) provides cross-country evidence on the response of international financial flows to hurricanes, and concludes that for poorer countries, increased hurricane exposure is associated with greater remittance flows"
14081,WB-2014-6.txt," In the Caribbean, a 1 percent decrease in real gross domestic product may be associated with a 3 percent increase in migrant remittances with a two-year lag (Mishra 2005)"
14082,WB-2014-6.txt,"


Do Remittances Reach Households Living in Unfavorable Climate Areas?

Evidence from household surveys also indicates that households use both migration and remittances as coping strategies in response to climate shocks"
14083,WB-2014-6.txt," Migration flows increased in the aftermath of disasters in Jamaica in 1989, after hurricane Gilbert and in Central America in 1998, and after hurricane Mitch (Wisner 2003)"
14084,WB-2014-6.txt," In El Salvador, an agricultural shock increases the probability of migration of a household member to the United States by 24"
14085,WB-2014-6.txt,3 percent (Halliday 2006)
14086,WB-2014-6.txt, Studies using household survey data also confirm the consumption smoothing role played by remittances in recipient households (Quartey and Blankson 2004)
14087,WB-2014-6.txt, Yang and Choi (2007) show for the Philippines that remittances help to compensate for nearly 65 percent of the loss in income due to rainfall shocks
14088,WB-2014-6.txt, Increased remittances helped to smooth household consumption and compensate for the loss of assets after an earthquake in El Salvador in 2001 (Halliday 2006)
14089,WB-2014-6.txt, A survey of households in four villages in Pakistan after the devastating earthquake in 2005 reveals that migrant remittances were important factors in disaster recovery and reconstruction (Suleri and Savage 2006)
14090,WB-2014-6.txt," Remittance-receiving households in the Aceh region of Indonesia were found to have recovered faster from the 2004 Tsunami because of immediate relief provided by migrant remittances, although remittance transfers were adversely affected due to the disruption of financial services and informal remittance transfer channels (Wu 2006)"
14091,WB-2014-6.txt, Konseiga (2007) finds evidence of migration to Cote d'Ivoire and resulting remittances used as a survival strategy in drought prone areas in North Eastern Burkina Faso
14092,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Despite the emerging consensus in the literature that migration and remittances are indeed part of an overall livelihood strategy by which households try to insure against shocks in disaster prone regions, there is less evidence on whether households use migration and receive remittances as part of a livelihood strategy in regions prone to slow onset disasters, or more generally adverse weather conditions as opposed to specific climate shocks"
14093,WB-2014-6.txt," Said differently, it is not clear whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of specific major climate shocks"
14094,WB-2014-6.txt," On the one hand, households in such areas often are poorer and thus need support, which may be an incentive for migrants to remit"
14095,WB-2014-6.txt," But such households also have limited means to send migrants away, especially internationally, and thus may not benefit from as large flows of remittances than households living in regions with better climate"
14096,WB-2014-6.txt," In addition, migrants from unfavorable climate regions are also less likely to be well educated and may thus have lower earning potential, which may in turn limit their ability to remit"
14097,WB-2014-6.txt,"
By combining a nationally representative household survey with climate and geographic data, this chapter tests whether in the Republic of Yemen remittance flows, both domestic and international, benefit more those households located in areas with unfavorable climate than households living in better climate areas"
14098,WB-2014-6.txt," This is done both with and without controls for household characteristics that may affect remittances, but may also be endogenous--a fact that is often brushed aside in empirical work on remittances"
14099,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The Republic of Yemen is an interesting case study for such work, given that it is highly vulnerable to the vagaries of weather"
14100,WB-2014-6.txt," This is suggested not only by
historical patterns of climatic variability, but also by extreme levels of water scarcity and high economic reliance on water dependent sectors such as agriculture and fisheries"
14101,WB-2014-6.txt," The topography of the country is highly diverse, with coastal plains where the population is concentrated, a mountainous interior, and upland deserts to the north toward the Saudi Arabia border"
14102,WB-2014-6.txt," Annual precipitation in many parts of the country is low, although much higher in the western mountainous highland region"
14103,WB-2014-6.txt," Temperatures are high, with more than occasional extreme values, but they also vary a lot across areas and over the year"
14104,WB-2014-6.txt," While climate models do not all agree on how the Republic of Yemen's climate is expected to change, there is agreement that temperatures are likely to rise, while rainfall will fall"
14105,WB-2014-6.txt," Due to near complete depletion of groundwater resources, agricultural output is projected to decrease by 4 percent in the next two decades (World Bank 2010)"
14106,WB-2014-6.txt," For households who will remain in areas with unfavorable climate, the ability to rely on remittances may well therefore be crucial for their livelihoods"
14107,WB-2014-6.txt," Looking at current patterns of remittances is one way to assess whether the hope of steady and substantial remittances flows for households living in ""climate-poor"" areas is realistic"
14108,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The chapter is structured as follows"
14109,WB-2014-6.txt, Section two presents the data and methodology
14110,WB-2014-6.txt," Section three presents the estimation of models for the likelihood of receiving remittances and the amounts received, both for domestic and international remittances"
14111,WB-2014-6.txt, A conclusion follows
14112,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Data and Methodology
We use the most recently available nationally representative household budget survey implemented in the Republic of Yemen, whose data were collected in 2005/06"
14113,WB-2014-6.txt," The survey includes 13,136 households (98,941 individuals) living in 309 of the country's 333 districts"
14114,WB-2014-6.txt," Apart from the location of households, the survey provides information on a wide range of socioeconomic characteristics including among others demographics, education, health and anthropometrics, employment and occupation, consumption and assets, and income including remittances"
14115,WB-2014-6.txt, Data are available on both domestic and international remittances
14116,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Beyond the household survey, and based on the location of households proxied through the most populous city in the district in which the household lives, we also use information on the distance between the household/district location and the coast, as well as the distance to the nearest airport"
14117,WB-2014-6.txt, These distances are calculated using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9
14118,WB-2014-6.txt,3 software
14119,WB-2014-6.txt," We also use measures of travel time to the nearest city with a population of at least 100,000 using a methodology developed from Nelson (2008) with regionally specific information (World Bank 2011)"
14120,WB-2014-6.txt, The percentage of irrigated land is taken from Global Map of Irrigated Areas version 4 (Siebert et al
14121,WB-2014-6.txt," 2005; Siebert, Hoogeveen, and Frenken 2006)"
14122,WB-2014-6.txt, Weather district-level data on annual mean temperature and rainfall and their variability/seasonality are collected from BIOCLIM (Busby 1991)
14123,WB-2014-6.txt, All weather variables are computed on observations for the period 1990­2000
14124,WB-2014-6.txt," We also include in some specifications governorate
dummy variables to control for additional geographic effects operating at a higher level of aggregation than the district"
14125,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The estimation method-a standard Heckman (1979) selection model-- enables us to look at both the likelihood of receiving remittances, and the amount of remittances received"
14126,WB-2014-6.txt, Estimations are provided for domestic and international remittances separately
14127,WB-2014-6.txt, The Heckman specification allows to control for potential selectivity in who receives remittances
14128,WB-2014-6.txt, It is however not easy find a variable that affects the probability of receiving remittances and not their amount
14129,WB-2014-6.txt," One candidate could be the leave-out-mean likelihood of receiving remittances (domestic or international) in the district in which the household lives, which reflects migration networks"
14130,WB-2014-6.txt," However, while this variable certainly affects the likelihood of migrating, it may also affect the amount of remittances received by households"
14131,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, it could be that larger networks may be associated with better employment opportunities at destination, which can, in turn, influence the amounts of remittances sent by the migrants (Munshi 2003)"
14132,WB-2014-6.txt," On the other hand, it could also be that if more migrants are coming to destination areas, they may compete for the same jobs and thereby benefit from lower wages which might reduce the amounts of remittances they are able to send back home"
14133,WB-2014-6.txt," Also, even if networks only influence migration costs and not wages at destination, they might still influence the demand for remittances in migrant-sending households (Carrington, Detragiache, and Vishwanath 1996; McKenzie and Rapoport 2010)"
14134,WB-2014-6.txt," For this reason, the leave-out-mean is included in our analysis in both the probit on whether households receive remittances, and in the levels regression for the amount of remittances received by households, with the Heckman model simply identified through the nonlinearity in the probit equation"
14135,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Table 11"
14136,WB-2014-6.txt,1 provides summary statistics for the variables used in the estimations
14137,WB-2014-6.txt," Out of the total number of households (13,136), 12,987 are used for the estimation due to missing values for some variables"
14138,WB-2014-6.txt," The number of households receiving remittances is 5,334 (43"
14139,WB-2014-6.txt,"63 percent when using sample weights), of which 4,019 (33"
14140,WB-2014-6.txt,"90 percent) receive domestic remittances, and 1,920 (14"

14144,WB-2014-6.txt,37 percent) do not receive any remittances
14145,WB-2014-6.txt," The average amount of remittances received among households who receive domestic remittances is YER 46,654 (US$252 at the average exchange rate in 2004 of US$1 = YER 185), while the average amount for international remittances is as expected significantly higher, at YER 218,786 (US$1,183)"
14146,WB-2014-6.txt," Given low standards of wellbeing in the country, these are rather substantial transfers"
14147,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Based on the basic statistics provided in table 11"
14148,WB-2014-6.txt,"1, a few facts are worth pointing out"
14149,WB-2014-6.txt," First, the differences in the characteristics of households receiving domestic and international remittances are smaller than one might have expected based on experience in other low income countries (see for example Hildebrandt and McKenzie 2005)"
14150,WB-2014-6.txt," Households receiving international remittances are ""better off"" in many dimensions (such as poverty status, education of the household head, land cultivation status, and so on), but not by a whole lot"
14151,WB-2014-6.txt," For example, poverty measures are lower among households receiving
international remittances, but the differences are smaller than one might have expected"
14152,WB-2014-6.txt," In general, the fact that poverty measures are relatively high among both domestic and international migrants suggests that migration is likely for the most part to be unskilled (this is related to the relatively low skills employment opportunities that are available for international migrants in nearby oil producing countries of the Gulf region, and especially neighboring Saudi Arabia)"
14153,WB-2014-6.txt," In terms of weather variables characterizing the areas in which households live, the differences between households receiving remittances, whether domestic or international, and the national sample are also small"
14154,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Turning to the regression methodology, it is important to start by pointing out that in many papers on the determinants of remittances using household survey data, a number of household level variables are included in the correlates"
14155,WB-2014-6.txt," This is however often problematic, because most of the household level correlates are at risk of being endogenous"
14156,WB-2014-6.txt, Consider the correlates included in tables 11
14157,WB-2014-6.txt,2 and 11
14158,WB-2014-6.txt, Whether the household head has a given level of education depends on who the household head is
14159,WB-2014-6.txt," When households receive remittances, it is typically because they have one or more migrants, and this may well include the household head"
14160,WB-2014-6.txt," This is the case when the husband or father has left the family either temporarily or for a longer period of time in order to increase his earnings through better employment, and thereby help the family members back at home through remittances"
14161,WB-2014-6.txt," In that case, if the wife is then considered as the household head at home in the survey, given that her level of education is often likely to be lower, the level of education of the head depends on the decision of the husband to migrate and send remittances, and is thus endogenous"
14162,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The same problem arises, albeit probably in a more diluted way, with the shares of household members above the age of 21 that have various levels of education"
14163,WB-2014-6.txt," But more generally, the type of occupation of the household members at home, and whether they cultivate land, own livestock, or have debts, may all be endogenous"
14164,WB-2014-6.txt," If one were to include additional variables (as is often done) such as poverty status or quintiles of well-being based on consumption, this would clearly depend on the remittances received (or lack thereof)"
14165,WB-2014-6.txt," Even if this often ignored in the applied survey-based literature in the drivers of migration and remittances, it is in general difficult to find household socioeconomic characteristics that are truly exogenous to the decision of some household members to migrate and send remittances"
14166,WB-2014-6.txt," And while some of these problems are alleviated when the household survey has information on members that were part of the household but have left (see for example Binzel and Assaad 2011), this is not the case for most surveys, and such information is not available in our data"
14167,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This being said, in this chapter our main interest is less on how household level correlates affect whether they receive remittances or not, than on whether remittances reach households that are located in areas with comparatively unfavorable climate"
14168,WB-2014-6.txt," This is why we include in the correlates a large number of district-level variables that were merged with the household survey data and that account for weather (temperature and rainfall), irrigated land characteristics, and location of the districts in which households live"
14169,WB-2014-6.txt," We have quite a few

district-level variables, and much more so than is typically found in the literature, as well as higher level governorate dummies"
14170,WB-2014-6.txt," Therefore we have the possibility of estimating at least somewhat meaningful models even without household characteristics, even though it must be clear that one could argue that it is problematic to try to explain household level variations with mostly geographic variables"
14171,WB-2014-6.txt," If one considers the models without household level variables as a test for robustness of the results obtained with the model with household controls, then the procedure enables us to test whether the partial correlations observed between remittances and district-level characteristics are indeed robust to the inclusion of household controls or not"
14172,WB-2014-6.txt," To the extent that the results are robust, we can be more confident in the results obtained for the geographic effects"
14173,WB-2014-6.txt," As we will show, the fact that the sign, magnitude, and statistical significance of most of the district-level variables do not change much whether we include household level correlates or not is a good sign of the validity of the estimates for the district-level variables which are the focus of this chapter"
14174,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Results
Tables 11"
14175,WB-2014-6.txt,2 and 11
14176,WB-2014-6.txt,"3 provide the regression estimates (Heckman model) for the likelihood of receiving domestic and international remittances, respectively, as well as the amounts received"
14177,WB-2014-6.txt, This is done with and without regional (governorate) variables as additional controls
14178,WB-2014-6.txt," The coefficients of the regional dummies are not reported here to save space, but they are available upon request and many of them are statistically significant"
14179,WB-2014-6.txt, Differences in results in the specifications with and without governorate dummies tend to be small
14180,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider first the results for domestic remittances without the household level controls in order to focus on the district-level variables"
14181,WB-2014-6.txt, Districts with more irrigated land are less likely to receive remittances
14182,WB-2014-6.txt," Apart from the migration network variable which has a strong effect on the probability of receiving remittances and several regional dummies that are not shown in the table, this is the only variable for which a statistically significant effect is observed in the probit when no household controls are included"
14183,WB-2014-6.txt,"1 One explanation might be that there is less need for households to send migrants away when more land is available for cultivation, which would reduce remittances"
14184,WB-2014-6.txt," As for the amounts of domestic remittances received, the coefficients of the many of the weather variables are statistically significant either in the specifications with or without regional dummies, and in several cases in both specifications"
14185,WB-2014-6.txt, The coefficients for three of the five weather variables (and their squared values when applicable) suggest that domestic remittances are lower in districts with unfavorable climate
14186,WB-2014-6.txt," This is the case for higher temperatures (negative impact with regional dummies), higher levels of precipitation (positive impact without regional dummies), and larger differences between minimum and maximum temperatures (negative impact without regional dummies)"
14187,WB-2014-6.txt, The coefficients for precipitation seasonality are not statistically significant
14188,WB-2014-6.txt," The only weather variable which suggests more remittances in climate poor areas is temperature seasonality, for which a higher value
is associated with higher remittances"
14189,WB-2014-6.txt, But one could argue that this is counteracted to some extent through the negative correlation between the amount of domestic remittances received and the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature
14190,WB-2014-6.txt,"
This suggests that unfavorable climate is associated with lower amounts of domestic remittances"
14191,WB-2014-6.txt, We are of course not claiming that climate itself necessarily influences the amounts of remittances received
14192,WB-2014-6.txt," The mechanisms at work may be much more complex, and are likely to be related in part to the fact that households living in districts with unfavorable climate may be poorer and less educated"
14193,WB-2014-6.txt," In that case, even when households are able to afford the cost of sending migrants (the weather variables where not statistically significant in the probits), the migrants may not be able to send back as large remittances as is the case for migrants from other areas"
14194,WB-2014-6.txt," This is only a speculation, but whatever the reasons for the findings, the fact is that districts with structural disadvantages in terms of their climate receive less domestic remittances"
14195,WB-2014-6.txt," The fact that many of the effects vanish when including regional dummies is not too surprising, given that weather patterns differ between regions, so this does not invalidate the results"
14196,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Consider next international remittances"
14197,WB-2014-6.txt," The likelihood of receiving remittances is again lower in districts with a higher share of irrigated land, probably for the same reason as mentioned before"
14198,WB-2014-6.txt, Higher temperatures are also associated with a lower probability of receiving international remittances (this is observed with regional dummies and the positive sign for the quadratic term does not affect the overall sign of the effect
14199,WB-2014-6.txt,) There is a positive effect on the probability of receiving remittances for the squared value of precipitation but this is only marginally statistically significant
14200,WB-2014-6.txt," Turning to the amounts received, two of the weather variables have a negative impact: higher temperatures lead to lower amounts received in the specification without regional dummies, and more precipitation seasonality reduces the amounts of remittances in the two specifications with and without regional dummies"
14201,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of the specification with regional dummies, temperature seasonality is associated with more remittances, but this is the only case where indicators of poorer weather lead to more remittances"
14202,WB-2014-6.txt," The upshot is that overall, households in districts with less favorable climate also tend to be less likely to receive international remittances, and when they do, the amounts received tend to be lower, as observed with domestic remittances"
14203,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Do these results remain when adding household level controls? They do, and remarkably so, not only in terms of sign and magnitude, but also in terms of statistical significance"
14204,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of domestic remittances, all results for the weather variables remain virtually the same when household level controls are added"
14205,WB-2014-6.txt," In the case of international remittances, stability is also observed in most cases, with two exceptions"
14206,WB-2014-6.txt," First, the effect of temperature seasonality on the amounts received in the specification with regional dummies vanishes when household controls are added"
14207,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the effect of precipitation on the probability of receiving remittances becomes statistically significant in the specification
without regional dummies when household controls are added"
14208,WB-2014-6.txt," These two changes both go in the way of our conclusion, which is that climate poor areas are less likely to receive remittances and when they do, receive less of them"
14209,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Beyond climatic variables, the other district variables (apart from the leaveout-means) which measure isolation of the districts also have an impact on domestic remittances, but not on international remittances, and the effects are robust to the inclusion of household controls"
14210,WB-2014-6.txt," For domestic remittances, being further away from an airport increases the likelihood of receiving domestic remittances, perhaps because international travel is more difficult"
14211,WB-2014-6.txt," Being further away from an airport or a port also increases the amount of remittances received, possibly for the same reason"
14212,WB-2014-6.txt," But being away from a large city reduces domestic remittances, perhaps because of fewer well paying employment opportunities for domestic migrants in nearby districts"
14213,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Finally, for the sake of completeness, it is worth briefly discussing the results for the household controls, even if they must be treated with caution due to the risk of endogeneity"
14214,WB-2014-6.txt," Households in rural areas are as likely to receive remittances as households in urban areas in most cases, but they tend to receive lower amounts, as expected"
14215,WB-2014-6.txt," A higher level of education is associated with both a lower likelihood of receiving remittances, and a lower amount of remittances received--the effects tend to be more often statistically significant for the household head than for the share of household members above the age of 21"
14216,WB-2014-6.txt," The effect on the probability to migrate may reflect the fact that much of the Republic of Yemen's migration is unskilled, and the effects on the amounts of remittances received may be linked to the fact that households whose members have higher education levels may need remittances less"
14217,WB-2014-6.txt," Households cultivating land are less likely to receive domestic remittances, probably because there is less of a need for members to leave, but are more likely to receive international remittances, perhaps because of a higher ability to pay for the cost of international migration"
14218,WB-2014-6.txt," Households with debts are more likely to benefit from domestic remittances, but the reverse is observed for international remittances"
14219,WB-2014-6.txt," As to the correlation between indebtedness and amounts, it is negative for both forms of remittances"
14220,WB-2014-6.txt," Different rationale might be provided for such results, but again endogeneity may be an issue"
14221,WB-2014-6.txt," As for network effects, when the effects are statistically significant they tend as already mentioned to increase the probability of receiving remittances, but they are negatively correlated with the amount of remittances received for both domestic and international remittances"
14222,WB-2014-6.txt," This would be consistent with a story emphasizing the competition between a larger number of migrants for limited job opportunities (especially in a context of substantial unemployment), which would then reduce the amounts of remittances that they are able to send back home"
14223,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Conclusion The literature suggests that migrant remittance flows increase in the aftermath of natural disasters, macroeconomic or financial crises, and act as a safety net for

Does the Impact of Remittances on Poverty and Human Development Depend on the Climate of Receiving Areas?
George Joseph and Quentin Wodon

This chapter uses matching techniques and a recent nationally representative household survey for Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition)"
14232,WB-2014-6.txt, The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate
14233,WB-2014-6.txt," Remittances are found to have a statistically significant impact on many of the indicators, and this is especially the case for international remittances which tend to provide more resources to their beneficiaries"
14234,WB-2014-6.txt," The impact of remittances on measures of poverty and malnutrition is also found to be stronger in districts that are affected by unfavorable climate (as measured through higher temperatures or lower levels of rainfall), while the impact of remittances on school enrollment is found to be stronger in areas with better climate"
14235,WB-2014-6.txt," The results are consistent with households in the least favorable areas using their remittances to meet basic needs first, while households in better areas can use remittances flows for education investments"
14236,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Introduction
Migration of household members and the potential resulting remittances are part of livelihood strategies used by households to insure against shocks in regions which are prone to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions"
14237,WB-2014-6.txt, There is ample evidence that migration and especially remittances may reduce poverty and improve human development outcomes for receiving households
14238,WB-2014-6.txt," According to Mansuri (2007), school enrollment rates increase by 54 percent for girls in migrant households in rural Pakistan (the increase is lower for boys at seven percent)"
14239,WB-2014-6.txt," Frank and Hummer (2002) find that infants born into Mexico-to-US migrant households have better birth outcomes: while nine percent of infants in

international migrant households have low birth weights, 11 percent of those in nonmigrant households have this condition"
14240,WB-2014-6.txt, Hildebrandt and McKenzie (2005) and McKenzie (2006) suggest that international migration has positive effects on both infant mortality and child weight among Mexican households
14241,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Remittance-receiving households typically have better asset ownership and are more entrepreneurial"
14242,WB-2014-6.txt, Taylor and Mora (2006) suggest that international migrant households have the largest marginal budget share for investments in rural Mexico
14243,WB-2014-6.txt, Makdissi and Wodon (2004) suggest that households with migrants have better housing
14244,WB-2014-6.txt," Osili (2004) shows that in Nigeria, a ten percent increase in migrants' income increases the probability of investing in housing by three percentage points in the country of origin"
14245,WB-2014-6.txt, Remittances also help to smooth consumption during adverse shocks--both through ex ante preparedness and ex post adaptation
14246,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Controlling for the endogeneity of the remittance-receiving status of households, remittances help to smooth consumption after floods in Bangladesh and build disaster resilient housing in Ghana and Burkina Faso and ensure sufficient liquidity during food shortage in Ethiopia (Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha 2011)"
14247,WB-2014-6.txt," Gubert (2007) finds that households in rural Mali use remittances to insure themselves against adverse shocks, with a 500 kilogram drop in grain output leading to a 48 percent increase in remittances; if that drop in grain output is coupled with a death in the family, remittances rise by 124 percent"
14248,WB-2014-6.txt,"
There is also evidence that migration and remittances reduce poverty"
14249,WB-2014-6.txt," Lokshin, Bontch-Osmolovski, and Glinskaya (2007) show that in Nepal almost 20 percent of the decline in poverty between 1995 and 2004 was linked to migration"
14250,WB-2014-6.txt, Adams and Page (2005) suggest that a ten percent increase in per capita international remittances leads to a 3
14251,WB-2014-6.txt,5 percent decline in the share of people in poverty
14252,WB-2014-6.txt, International remittances reduce poverty in Latin America by 0
14253,WB-2014-6.txt,4 percent for each percentage point increase in the remittances to GDP ratio (Acosta et al
14254,WB-2014-6.txt," Conversely, a drop in international remittances may lead to higher poverty, as observed in Burkina Faso after the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire reduced the ability of migrants to remit (Siaens and Wodon 2011)"
14255,WB-2014-6.txt,"
The question investigated in this chapter is somewhat different"
14256,WB-2014-6.txt, We are interested in assessing whether the impact of remittances on poverty and human development indicators depends on the areas in which households live
14257,WB-2014-6.txt, Our hypothesis is that remittances may have a larger impact in areas affected by unfavorable climate because it is in those areas that households tend to be most vulnerable
14258,WB-2014-6.txt," By combining climate and household survey data from Yemen, we test whether domestic and international remittances reduce poverty and improve education and malnutrition indicators more in areas with high temperatures and low rainfalls"
14259,WB-2014-6.txt,"
Yemen is an interesting case study for this work"
14260,WB-2014-6.txt," First, it has high levels of migration, both domestic and international, and as a result many households do benefit from remittances"
14261,WB-2014-6.txt," In the nationally representative household survey for 2006 that we use for the analysis, 43"

14266,WB-2014-6.txt,") Yemen's topography is diverse, with a mountainous core at the center, coastal plains in the east, west, and south, and upland deserts to the north, toward the Saudi Arabia border"
14267,WB-2014-6.txt, The country suffers from a relatively harsh climate in many areas
14268,WB-2014-6.txt, Rainfall is limited and the population must deal with high levels of water scarcity as well as persisting economic reliance on water dependent sectors such as rainfed agriculture
14269,WB-2014-6.txt," The average annual mean temperature is 22 degrees Celsius in our data from BIOCLIM, but there are large differences between various parts of the country as well as over the year, and temperatures have peaked to well above 50 degrees"
14270,WB-2014-6.txt, Climate change is likely to progressively bring in even higher temperatures and lower rainfalls in the future
14271,WB-2014-6.txt," Climate is not only likely to play an important role in decisions by household members to migrate and remit, but it is also likely to affect poverty and human development outcomes both directly and indirectly through its impact on livelihoods"
14272,WB-2014-6.txt," In turn, as a coping mechanism, the impact of remittances may differ between areas"
14273,WB-2014-6.txt,"

14284,WB-2014-6.txt,")
Beyond the household survey, and based on the location of households proxied through the most populous city in the district in which the household lives, we also use information on the distance between the household/district location and the coast, as well as the distance to the nearest airport; these distances are calculated using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9"

Results
In principle, we would expect remittances to have a potentially large impact on poverty and human development indicators"

14309,WB-2014-6.txt," For our purpose, the interesting comparison is between districts with high or low temperatures, as well as between districts with high and low levels of rainfall"
14310,WB-2014-6.txt," Specifically, we will consider the top 20 percent districts with high temperature and the bottom 20 percent districts in terms of rainfall, and compare these groups with respectively the bottom 20 percent districts in terms of temperatures and the top 20 percent districts in terms of rainfall"

14313,WB-2014-6.txt," In districts with low rainfall, the effects of remittances are statistically significant for the same five measures as observed in the case of high temperatures"
14314,WB-2014-6.txt," By contrast, in districts with high rainfall, the effect of remittances is statistically significant for none of these indicators, but it is for male and female school enrollment"
14315,WB-2014-6.txt," Taking both statistical significance and the magnitude of the effects when they are statistically significant, the results suggest that remittances have a larger impact on poverty and especially nutrition measures in areas affected by more difficult climate, while in areas with better climate (especially higher rainfall), education gains tend to be larger"

Similar results tend to be observed in tables 12"

14319,WB-2014-6.txt," One would expect that for households benefitting from remittances, the impacts on the various indicators would be larger in the case of international remittances simply because the average level of international remittances among beneficiaries is much higher than the average level of domestic remittances among beneficiaries"
14320,WB-2014-6.txt," This is indeed observed through the fact that at the national level, for example, impacts are statistically significant for only three indicators with domestic remittances (the three poverty measures), while impacts are statistically significant for seven indicators in the case of international remittances (the three poverty measures, as well as school enrollment for both boys and girls, and stunting and wasting)"
14321,WB-2014-6.txt,"
But what about the comparison between districts in terms of climate? Consider first domestic remittances"
14322,WB-2014-6.txt," When looking at temperatures, apart from the results for the poverty measures which tend to be similar in both sets of districts, we see that for domestic remittances, there is a statistically significant impact of remittances on stunting in districts with high temperatures, while this is not the case for districts with low temperatures"
14323,WB-2014-6.txt," (There is also a curious reduction in male immunization with remittances in high temperatures districts-but
this is the only case of unexpected result, and the only time that the effect is statistically significant for immunization, so one can probably discount that observation)"
14324,WB-2014-6.txt," When looking at rainfall, we see that the effects on poverty are statistically significant for two of the poverty measures in low rainfall areas, while this is not the case in high rainfall areas"

This is also observed for international remittances, especially when comparing districts with low and high temperatures"
14328,WB-2014-6.txt," In districts with low temperatures, the impact of international remittances is statistically significant for school enrollment only, while in districts with high temperatures, the impacts are statistically significant for the poverty measures, school enrollment for boys, and the three measures of malnutrition"
14329,WB-2014-6.txt," The differences in impact are lower when comparing districts with high and low levels of rainfall--there the impacts are similar in terms of statistical significance and often as well magnitude for the poverty measures, but school enrollment gains tend to be statistically significant in areas with high rainfall (both types of districts in terms of rainfall levels exhibit some gains in nutrition measures from international remittances, with one of the three impacts being statistically significant, albeit not the same one in the two types of districts)"
14330,WB-2014-6.txt,"

Conclusion
Is the impact of remittances on poverty and human development different in various areas depending on their climate? By combining nationally representative household survey data with climate data, we have tried to answer this question in the case of Yemen"
14331,WB-2014-6.txt, Our main results can be summarized in four main points
14332,WB-2014-6.txt," First, remittances--which are substantial in Yemen--tend to have positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition"
14333,WB-2014-6.txt," Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances"
14334,WB-2014-6.txt," Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable"
14335,WB-2014-6.txt," Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment"
14336,WB-2014-6.txt," Thus, the results suggest, as might be expected, that in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances can be used by households for investments, such as investments in the education of children"

Foreword

Ending poverty and addressing climate change are the two defining issues of our time"
15207,WB-2016-9.txt, Both are essential to achieving sustainable global development
15208,WB-2016-9.txt, But they cannot be considered in isolation
15209,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This report brings together these two overarching objectives and explores how they can be more easily achieved if considered together"
15210,WB-2016-9.txt, It demonstrates the urgency of efforts to reduce poverty and the vulnerability of poor people in the face of climate change
15211,WB-2016-9.txt, It also provides guidance on how to ensure that climate change policies contribute to poverty reduction and poverty reduction policies contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building
15212,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Our studies show that without action, climate change would likely spark higher agricultural prices and could threaten food security in poorer regions such as SubSaharan Africa and South Asia"
15213,WB-2016-9.txt," And in most countries where we have data, poor urban households are more exposed to floods than the average urban population"
15214,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Climate change also will magnify many threats to health, as poor people are more susceptible to climate-related diseases such as malaria and diarrhea"
15215,WB-2016-9.txt," As the report points out, poverty reduction is not a one-way street"
15216,WB-2016-9.txt," Many people exit or fall back into poverty

each year"
15217,WB-2016-9.txt," The poor live in uncertainty, just one natural disaster away from losing everything they have"
15218,WB-2016-9.txt,"
We need good, climate-informed development to reduce the impacts of climate change on the poor"
15219,WB-2016-9.txt," This means, in part, providing poor people with social safety nets and universal health care"
15220,WB-2016-9.txt," These efforts will need to be coupled with targeted climate resilience measures, such as the introduction of heatresistant crops and disaster preparedness systems"
15221,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The report shows that without this type of development, climate change could force more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030"
15222,WB-2016-9.txt," But with rapid, inclusive development that is adapted to changing climate conditions, most of these impacts can be prevented"
15223,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Over the longer term, we will face the limits of what good development and risk management can achieve"
15224,WB-2016-9.txt, Only immediate emissions-reduction policies can limit the long-term impacts of climate change on the poor
15225,WB-2016-9.txt," This report shows that these policies need not burden, and can actually benefit, the poor, through the use of proven mechanisms such as social safety nets to mitigate the impact of higher energy prices"
15226,WB-2016-9.txt," The international community must also support poor
countries that cannot provide such protection"
15227,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The report combines the findings from household surveys in 92 countries that describe demographic structures and income sources with the most recent modeling results on the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and food prices; natural hazards such as heat waves, floods, and droughts; and climate-sensitive diseases and other health consequences"
15228,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Based on these findings and results, the report gives a renewed urgency to the objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 while tackling climate change"
15229,WB-2016-9.txt, Development and poverty alleviation reduce people's vulnerability to the effects of a changing climate
15230,WB-2016-9.txt,"

And ending extreme poverty will be more achievable now--with limited climate change impacts--than later, when impacts are likely to be larger"
15231,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The report shows us that the best way forward is to design and implement solutions to end extreme poverty and stabilize climate change as an integrated strategy"
15232,WB-2016-9.txt," Such concerted action, implemented quickly and inclusively, can help ensure that millions of people are not pushed back into poverty by the multifaceted impacts of climate change"
15233,WB-2016-9.txt,"


Introduction
Climate change threatens the objective of sustainably eradicating poverty"
15234,WB-2016-9.txt," Poor people and poor countries are exposed and vulnerable to all types of climate-related shocks-- natural disasters that destroy assets and livelihoods; waterborne diseases and pests that become more prevalent during heat waves, floods, or droughts; crop failure from reduced rainfall; and spikes in food prices that follow extreme weather events"
15235,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate-related shocks also affect those who are not poor but remain vulnerable and can drag them into poverty--for example, when a flood destroys a micro-enterprise, a drought decimates a herd, or contaminated water makes a child sick"
15236,WB-2016-9.txt, Such events can erase decades of hard work and asset accumulation and leave people with irreversible health consequences
15237,WB-2016-9.txt, Changes in climate conditions caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere can worsen these shocks and slow down poverty reduction
15238,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Ending poverty will not be possible if climate change and its effects on poor people are not accounted for and managed in development and poverty-reduction policies"
15239,WB-2016-9.txt," But neither can the climate be stabilized without

acknowledging that ending poverty is an utmost priority"
15240,WB-2016-9.txt, The goal of maintaining climate change below a 2°C increase in global temperature above preindustrial levels--the very goal the international community has committed to--will require deep structural changes in the world economy
15241,WB-2016-9.txt, These changes will affect the conditions under which poor people succeed or fail to escape poverty
15242,WB-2016-9.txt," Emissions-reduction policies can increase energy and food prices, which represent a large share of poor people's expenditures"
15243,WB-2016-9.txt," But these same policies can be designed to protect, and even benefit, poor people--for instance, by using fiscal resources from environmental taxes to improve social protection"
15244,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Ending poverty and stabilizing climate change will be two unprecedented global achievements and two major steps toward sustainable development--that is, development that balances the economic, social, and environmental considerations"
15245,WB-2016-9.txt, But these two objectives cannot be considered in isolation: they need to be jointly tackled through an integrated strategy
15246,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This report brings together these two objectives--ending poverty and stabilizing climate change--and explores how they can more easily be achieved if considered together"
15247,WB-2016-9.txt," It examines the potential impact of climate

change and climate policies on poverty reduction"
15248,WB-2016-9.txt," It also provides guidance on how to create a ""win-win"" situation so that climate change policies contribute to poverty reduction and poverty-reduction policies contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building"
15249,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The key finding of the report is that climate change represents a significant obstacle to the sustained eradication of poverty, but future impacts on poverty are determined by policy choices: rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most short-term impacts whereas immediate propoor, emissions-reduction policies can drastically limit long-term ones:
· Climate-related shocks and stresses, already a major obstacle to poverty reduction, will worsen with climate change"
15250,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate is involved in most of the shocks that keep or bring households into poverty--notably, natural disasters (such as floods that cause asset loss and disability); health shocks (such as malaria that results in health expenditures and lost labor income); and crop losses and food price shocks (due to drought or crop disease)"
15251,WB-2016-9.txt," Poor people are disproportionately affected--not only because they are often more exposed and invariably more vulnerable to climate-related shocks but also because they have fewer resources and receive less support from family, community, the financial system, and even social safety nets to prevent, cope, and adapt"
15252,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate change will worsen these shocks and stresses, contributing to a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction, thereby making it even harder to eradicate poverty in a sustainable manner"
15253,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· In the short run, rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most (but not all) consequences of climate change on poverty"
15254,WB-2016-9.txt," Absent such good development, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030"
15255,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Between now and 2030, climate policies can do little to alter the amount of global warming that will take place"
15256,WB-2016-9.txt," The only option, therefore, is to reduce vulnerability through both targeted adaptation investments and improved socioeconomic conditions (higher incomes and lower poverty and inequality)"
15257,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Although development and adaptation cannot prevent all negative impacts from climate change, by 2030 they can prevent or offset most of its effects on poverty"
15258,WB-2016-9.txt, But development must be rapid and inclusive to reduce poverty and provide poor people with social safety nets and universal health coverage
15259,WB-2016-9.txt, It also needs to be climate informed--meaning that investments and development patterns do not create new vulnerabilities and account for what we know about future climate conditions
15260,WB-2016-9.txt, And it needs to be accompanied by targeted adaptation (like upgrades in flood defenses or more heat-tolerant crops)
15261,WB-2016-9.txt, · Immediate mitigation is required to remove the long-term threat that climate change creates for poverty eradication
15262,WB-2016-9.txt, Mitigation need not threaten short-term progress on poverty reduction provided policies are well designed and international support is available
15263,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Our ability to manage increasing climate change impacts is limited"
15264,WB-2016-9.txt," To keep long-term impacts on poverty in check, global temperatures need to be stabilized at a safe level--which implies that net global carbon emissions be brought down to zero before the end of the century"
15265,WB-2016-9.txt, Such an ambitious goal requires that all governments act now to implement emissions-reduction policies
15266,WB-2016-9.txt," These policies will unambiguously benefit poor people over the long term, thanks to reduced climate change impacts, and they can be designed not to slow down poverty reduction over the short term"
15267,WB-2016-9.txt,"
All countries should pursue options that provide local and immediate benefits (like less pollution, better health, improved energy access and efficiency, reduced energy expenditures, and higher

agricultural productivity)"
15268,WB-2016-9.txt," Governments can protect the poor from the consequences of those mitigation policies that could impose net costs and create trade-offs--notably by strengthening social protection and cash transfers or reducing taxes, possibly using revenues from energy or carbon taxes or fossil fuel subsidy removal"
15269,WB-2016-9.txt," In poor countries where domestic resources are insufficient to protect poor people, support from the international community is essential"
15270,WB-2016-9.txt," This is particularly true for investments with high upfront costs that are critical to prevent lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (such as for urban transport, energy infrastructure, or deforestation)"
15271,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Climate change is a threat to
poverty eradication
Poverty reduction is not a one-way transition out of poverty: many people exit or fall back into poverty every year"
15272,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, over a 25-year period, every year an average of 14 percent of households in 36 communities in Andhra Pradesh, India, escaped poverty and 12 percent of nonpoor households became poor--resulting in a net 2 percent annual decrease in poverty (figure O"
15273,WB-2016-9.txt," The fact that, in practice, the net flow out of poverty is much smaller than the gross flows in and out of poverty means that a relatively small change in the gross flows in and out of poverty can significantly affect net flows and overall poverty dynamics"
15274,WB-2016-9.txt," In the India example, if the flow into poverty increased from 12 to 13 percent per year or the flow out of poverty slowed from 14 to 13 percent per year, the pace of poverty reduction would be reduced by half"
15275,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Today, climate conditions or climate events are already involved in many cases where households fall into poverty"
15276,WB-2016-9.txt," They include price shocks that can be linked to lower agricultural production (as occurred after the Russian droughts in 2010); natural disasters that destroy poor people's assets and affect health and education; and health shocks (such

as death and illness) that are influenced by climate and environmental conditions (like higher rainfall and more malaria outbreaks, or higher temperatures and more frequent diarrhea)"
15277,WB-2016-9.txt," In addition, climate risks affect the behavior of people, who may reduce investments and asset accumulation because of the possibility of losses and select lower-risk but lower-return activities--a rational strategy to avoid catastrophic outcomes, but one that can keep them in poverty"
15278,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The key question then is: How much will climate change influence the flows in and out of poverty and affect poverty over time? This report reviews the evidence and provides new quantification on the issue"
15279,WB-2016-9.txt," It does this by examining the impact of climate change on three interacting channels that are already affecting the ability of the poor to escape poverty--agricultural and ecosystem impacts, natural disasters, and health shocks--and then deriving policy implications"
15280,WB-2016-9.txt," Here we should note that climate change will have other impacts (for example on tourism or energy prices) that are not reviewed and assessed in this report, and a comprehensive estimate of all climate change impacts remains out of reach"
15281,WB-2016-9.txt," However, even a subset of all possible impacts reveals worrying patterns on how changes in climate conditions would threaten the objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030"
15282,WB-2016-9.txt,"



We find that climate change already worsens--and will further exacerbate-- climate-sensitive shocks and negative trends in the three sectors that we consider, consistent with recent reports from the World Bank (2014a) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014; Olsson et al"
15283,WB-2016-9.txt," We also show that there will be an impact on poverty and inequality because poor people (i) are more often affected by these negative shocks or trends (they are more exposed); (ii) lose more when affected, relative to their income or wealth (they are more vulnerable); and (iii) receive less support from family, friends, and community, and have less access to financial tools or social safety nets to help prevent, prepare for, and manage impacts"
15284,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Poor people are more vulnerable to spikes in food prices and more dependent on agricultural and ecosystem-related income
Impacts on agricultural production and prices--triggered by either gradual changes in long-term climate trends or more frequent and severe natural disasters--will affect poor

people through food production impacts, higher consumption prices, and changes in rural incomes"
15285,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Lower crop yields and higher food prices"
15286,WB-2016-9.txt," Modeling studies suggest that climate change could result in global crop yield losses as large as 5 percent in 2030 and 30 percent in 2080, even accounting for adaptive behaviors such as changed agricultural practices and crops, more irrigation, and innovation in higher yield crops (Biewald et al"

More generally, the impacts of climate mitigation policies on inequality can be corrected

using policies specifically designed to redistribute income in the economy--such as using income or consumption taxes to fund cash transfers or social safety net programs (Borenstein and Davis 2015; Gahvari and Mattos 2007; Lindert, Skoufias, and Shapiro 2006)"
15596,WB-2016-9.txt," A World Bank study based on household surveys reveals that countries with GDP per capita above $4,000 (in purchasing power parity) have sufficient internal resources to redistribute poverty away, and thus can protect poor people against the possible negative effects of climate mitigation (Ravallion 2010)"
15597,WB-2016-9.txt, This is important because around 70 percent of people in extreme poverty live in these countries that are able to protect them
15598,WB-2016-9.txt,"
But in very poor countries, it may be difficult for economic, political, or institutional reasons to accomplish this"
15599,WB-2016-9.txt," In particular, the same World Bank study shows that countries with a GDP per capita below $4,000 (in purchasing power parity) would find it nearly impossible to rely on internal resources for redistribution"
15600,WB-2016-9.txt," In these countries, even if most of the cost of climate mitigation is paid for by the wealthier quintiles of the population,

climate mitigation could still worsen poverty, because the top quintiles are still in, or close to, poverty"

15602,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This is especially the case for investments that involve high immediate costs--and therefore large trade-offs with other investments-- but are urgently needed to prevent irreversibility and lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns"

15604,WB-2016-9.txt," While transit-oriented development may require higher upfront costs than road-based low- density urbanization, there is now a unique window of opportunity to build efficient transit-oriented cities, because of high urbanization rates in many developing countries and the extended lifetime of urban forms and transit infrastructure"

15611,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· The net impact of climate change on poverty and well-being will be mediated by socioeconomic trends (like demography, growth, and inequality) and non-climate change policies (like skills development and redistribution)"
15612,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Over the medium to long term, the impact of climate change on poverty will also depend on greenhouse gas emissions and thus on emissions-reduction policies"
15613,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
Despite substantial progress in reducing poverty rates, around 700 million people still live in extreme poverty (World Bank 2015a)"
15614,WB-2016-9.txt,"1 In addition, hundreds of millions hover close above the poverty line, vulnerable to shocks that could send them into poverty, or suffer from other dimensions of poverty-- such as exclusion, powerlessness, and poor health--even if their consumption is above the poverty threshold (Bourguignon and Chakravarty 2003; Ferreira and Lugo 2013)"
15615,WB-2016-9.txt,"

At the same time, the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda--which builds on the 2015 Millennium Development Goals--has reaffirmed the goal of ending extreme poverty or, as framed by the World Bank, bringing the number of people living on less than $1"
15616,WB-2016-9.txt,90 per day to under 3 percent by 2030
15617,WB-2016-9.txt," Moreover, the agreed goal is not simply to eliminate poverty by 2030, but to eliminate it for good and ensure gains are not reversed after 2030"
15618,WB-2016-9.txt,"
How does climate change fit into this picture? We know that climate change affects the

population, including the poorest, through changes in environmental conditions and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (O'Brien and Leichenko 2000; Olsson et al"
15619,WB-2016-9.txt," While the magnitude of climate change is likely to be relatively limited between now and 2030, compared with what can be expected over the long term, its impacts may still be important in certain locations (like semi-arid areas where precipitation will decrease in response to climate change) or for certain people (like those already living close to subsistence levels)"
15620,WB-2016-9.txt," Moreover, anticipated warming by 2030 cannot be reduced much, as any action taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions takes several decades to significantly affect climate change"
15621,WB-2016-9.txt,"
As we approach the end of this century, in the absence of ambitious climate-mitigation policies, global warming may exceed 4°C, and impacts are likely to become ""severe, widespread and irreversible,"" threatening poverty reduction and development (IPCC 2014a; World Bank 2015b)"
15622,WB-2016-9.txt," But the good news is that we still have a window of opportunity to adopt and implement emissionsreduction policies that could slow down and stabilize long-term climate change, and in the process, usher in a more prosperous world"
15623,WB-2016-9.txt,"
One more wrinkle in this story is that the climate change­poverty link is actually twoway"
15624,WB-2016-9.txt," Expected progress in poverty reduction and access to basic services has the potential to reduce vulnerability to climate change and reduce its impacts (Hallegatte, Przyluski, and Vogt-Schilb 2011; Wilbanks and Ebi 2013)"
15625,WB-2016-9.txt, But the future of poverty also matters for climate change
15626,WB-2016-9.txt," Development and economic growth, critical elements for reducing poverty, directly affect energy consumption and access to technologies--which, in turn, affect greenhouse gas emissions and the long-term pace and magnitude of climate change"
15627,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Against this backdrop--and the limited research done so far on this two-way relationship--this report sets out to explore the potential impact of climate change and climate policies on poverty reduction, and investigate whether climate change can represent a significant obstacle to the objective of

ending extreme poverty"
15628,WB-2016-9.txt, It also provides guidance on how to design climate policies such that they contribute to poverty reduction as well as on how to design poverty-reduction policies such that they contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building
15629,WB-2016-9.txt, And it contributes to a series of reports that explore the complex relationship between development and climate change (box 1
15630,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The report aims to answer the following questions:
· Will the changing climate be a threat to ending poverty, at what time horizon, and under which conditions? Would climate change make it impossible to end poverty only in the most pessimistic scenarios, or would it be a threat even in more moderate or optimistic cases? Will this impact be concentrated in highly vulnerable locations, or more broadly distributed globally? Is it a long-term trend, or is it also relevant over the shorter term?
· What emissions-reduction policies and adaptation actions can reduce this threat? In particular, how can we balance short-term actions (like reducing vulnerability to floods and droughts) with longterm goals such as stabilizing the climate? How should adaptation actions navigate across different options to reduce vulnerability--from poverty reduction and increased income to targeted adaptation policies and social protection? How can adaptation policies prevent lock-ins into activities and locations that will become increasingly unable to sustain rising standards of living?
· How should poverty concerns be factored into mitigation and adaptation policies? Are there trade-offs between mitigation and poverty goals, and if so how can these be managed? Can complementary policies cancel out potential negative effects on the poor? How can we design adaptation policies so that they benefit poor people and contribute to poverty reduction?
· How should the existence of climate change modify poverty reduction strategies?

Recognizing that poor people are more vulnerable, does climate change influence what should be the priority for poverty reduction? Is there a risk of a ""global poverty trap"" if people who are still in extreme poverty are unable to adapt to climate change and thus escape poverty? And how can we ensure that the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is not achieved in a way that creates greater vulnerability post-2030?

15654,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Climate change is an obstacle for people to escape poverty
Given that economic growth plays a critical role in reducing poverty, a key concern for poverty eradication is the impact of climate change on growth"
15655,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, in the past, the income of the bottom 20 percent of the population has increased much more as a result of increases in the average income than from increases in the share of the income that goes to the bottom quintiles (Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay 2013;

Dollar and Kraay 2002)"
15656,WB-2016-9.txt, This relationship could of course change in the future if governments implement substantial redistributive policies (Ferreira and Ravallion 2009; Robalino and Warr 2006)
15657,WB-2016-9.txt," But substantial redistribution is not easy politically, and the poorest countries simply lack the resources to eradicate poverty through redistribution"
15658,WB-2016-9.txt, Economic growth will thus be needed to bring people out of poverty (Ravallion 2010)
15659,WB-2016-9.txt,"

15666,WB-2016-9.txt,8 percent drop in income in the long run for every 1°C warming (Horowitz 2009)
15667,WB-2016-9.txt,"
But what should countries expect from global warming in the future? Here, the evidence is inconclusive, with estimates based on very simple, partial models that vary widely (Pindyck 2013; Stern 2013)"
15668,WB-2016-9.txt, Most studies find a relatively limited impact on GDP
15669,WB-2016-9.txt," The latest Synthesis Report of the IPCC states that ""incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of [about] 2"

15672,WB-2016-9.txt,"0% of income"" (figure 1"
15673,WB-2016-9.txt,"1), but adds that these estimates are likely to underestimate actual impacts"
15674,WB-2016-9.txt," In particular, existing estimates have focused on limited warming (below 3°C) and do not include many sources of impacts that may prove consequential--such as the impact of ecosystems on economic activity, or the risk from surprises and tipping points"
15675,WB-2016-9.txt," Studies including these elements, even in a simplistic manner, have found much larger potential impacts (Stern 2006; Weitzman 2014)"
15676,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, the confidence in these estimates is limited, especially for warming that exceeds 2°C (IPCC 2014a)"
15677,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Based on these macroeconomic estimates of future aggregate impacts of climate change, the impacts on poverty via the GDP channel are small--possibly less than 1 percent by 2050 (Skoufias, Rabassa, and Olivieri 2011)"
15678,WB-2016-9.txt,"
But of course, climate change does not only affect poor people via economic aggregates, it also can affect them directly"
15679,WB-2016-9.txt," In fact, its direct impacts will likely be more significant than the growth-mediated one, and may not significantly affect aggregate GDP, since poor people represent a very small share of global income"
15680,WB-2016-9.txt," This is because climate change can affect household consumption (and thus consumption-related poverty) through four channels almost independently of aggregate growth:
· Prices"
15681,WB-2016-9.txt," Consumption in real terms is driven by price levels and relative prices, which can be affected by multiple trends, shocks, and policies"
15682,WB-2016-9.txt," Spikes in prices of basic goods can have large impacts on poverty numbers (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012), and climate change may increase the level and volatility of food prices and thus hurt poor people who usually spend a large share of their income on food (chapter 2)"
15683,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Assets"
15684,WB-2016-9.txt, Households escape poverty by accumulating assets (Moser 2008)
15685,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, they acquire education or information, improve their health, and invest in productive assets such as livestock or manufacturing equipment"
15686,WB-2016-9.txt," Assets usually include the financial, physical, human, social, and natural capital that households own"
15687,WB-2016-9.txt," They also include public goods, infrastructure, and institutions that households have access to"
15688,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate change can affect asset accumulation and poverty reduction by destroying assets during disasters or affecting people's incentive and ability to invest in new assets (chapter 3), or by affecting people's health (chapter 4)"
15689,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· Productivity"
15690,WB-2016-9.txt," Households can increase the return on their assets (including labor) by being more efficient and improving production processes, although returns are often limited by economic inefficiencies (such as corruption, market failures, and inappropriate regulations)"
15691,WB-2016-9.txt, Returns are also affected by changes in the price of what households produce
15692,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate change can decrease these returns through lower agricultural yields (chapter 2) and labor productivity (chapter 4), or increase them through higher agricultural prices (chapter 2)"
15693,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Opportunities"
15694,WB-2016-9.txt," Households can also increase their income by expanding their range of activities or migrating, typically to cities (Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014)"
15695,WB-2016-9.txt, This is possible thanks to new opportunities in new sectors and activities
15696,WB-2016-9.txt," But those opportunities are often limited by exclusion (for example, based on gender or ethnicity) and constraints on mobility"

change can worsen the situation through more conflicts, increased competition for resources, higher risk aversion, or poorly designed adaptation policies (such as greater reliance on nonportable safety nets; chapter 5)"
15698,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Of course, these channels interact closely"
15699,WB-2016-9.txt," Lower agricultural productivity could lead to higher food prices, which can make it impossible for some households to continue saving and build their asset stock"
15700,WB-2016-9.txt," Capturing new opportunities requires investments and sometimes migration, activities that are possible only with an appropriate asset base"
15701,WB-2016-9.txt, And price changes will affect consumption (for net buyers) and income (for net sellers) simultaneously
15702,WB-2016-9.txt,"
If poor people are disproportionally affected by climate change impacts through these channels, the impact of climate change on poverty will be larger than what is suggested by the macro impact on GDP--and climate change can lead to a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction"

15712,WB-2016-9.txt,2 The fact that the net flow out of poverty is much smaller than the gross flows in and out of poverty means that a relatively small change in the gross flows can have a significant effect on the net flows and thus overall poverty dynamics

15797,WB-2016-9.txt," In Bangladesh, of nearly 400 households falling into poverty, 15 percent cite natural disasters and 18 percent the loss of natural assets as the main reasons (Sen 2003)"
15798,WB-2016-9.txt, Changed weather patterns and modified rainfall may increase or decrease the frequency and intensity of such weather shocks and therefore change the flow of households into poverty

Climatic and environmental conditions affect the ability of households to escape poverty"
15800,WB-2016-9.txt," Climate change may make it more difficult for poor people to increase their income and accumulate assets, or may even lead in extreme cases to ""poverty traps"" (that is, when people own so little that they cannot invest to increase their income)"

15807,WB-2016-9.txt," Next, households consume more durable goods and diversify their asset base by investing in productive assets (like children's education and financial capital) to better cope with negative shocks such as illness or natural

disasters"
15808,WB-2016-9.txt," In Bangladesh, a recent study tells a similar story"
15809,WB-2016-9.txt," Households that receive assets (such as livestock or a sewing machine, complete with income support and training) build and diversify their asset portfolio to increase their income and reduce vulnerability to negative shocks (Barrett et al"
15810,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Households also escape poverty because they have access to jobs with better wages, and in developing countries these jobs are largely created by private micro-, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), often in the informal sector"
15811,WB-2016-9.txt," These firms therefore play a key role in reducing poverty, especially where many young people enter the job market (World Bank 2012)"
15812,WB-2016-9.txt, But recent studies show that these firms are particularly ill-equipped to anticipate and adapt to environmental change and prepare for natural disasters
15813,WB-2016-9.txt," In Turkey, more than 60 percent of the MSMEs interviewed in a recent study reported that they did not have enough understanding of climate risks and access to resources and financial and insurance instruments to manage climate-related risks (IFC and EBRD 2013)"

· Following weather shocks in SubSaharan Africa, asset-poor households typically provide children with lowerquality nutrition (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006; Dercon and Porter 2014; Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005) and are less likely to take sick children for medical consultations (Jensen 2000)"
15826,WB-2016-9.txt," These behaviors have short- and long-term impacts, especially for children under the age of two--like stunted growth (Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005) and a greater tendency to get sick (Dercon and Porter 2014)"

15843,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Risk exposure also reduces credit market willingness to lend--in other words, those with uninsured weather risk have limited access to credit and investments"

Poverty reduction, socioeconomic trends, and non-climate policies affect climate risk
So we know that climate events and environmental degradation affect poverty reduction today"
15860,WB-2016-9.txt," But the future impacts of climate change will depend on future conditions, including not only the magnitude and patterns of the change in climate but also the speed and direction of poverty reduction and future socioeconomic changes (Hallegatte, Przyluski, and Vogt-Schilb 2011)"
15861,WB-2016-9.txt," It is not hard to imagine that, in a world where everyone has access to water and sanitation, the impacts of climate change on waterborne diseases will be smaller than in a world where uncontrolled urbanization has led to widespread underserved settlements located in flood zones"
15862,WB-2016-9.txt," Similarly, in a country whose workers mostly work outside or live and work without air conditioning, the impact of hotter weather on labor productivity and income will be stronger than in an industrialized economy"
15863,WB-2016-9.txt, And a poorer household with a large share of its consumption dedicated to food will be more vulnerable to climate-related food price fluctuations than a wealthier household
15864,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The impacts of--and risks from--climate change depend on the following three factors:
· Hazard: The physical event or trend (like a windstorm, a flood, or a trend in temperature), which is measured using physical metrics (like the maximum wind speed, the water level, or the temperature change over a decade) and is independent of any socioeconomic characteristics or human presence"
15865,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Exposure: The population and the amount of assets that are located where the hazard can occur (like the population and houses located in a flood plain) or more generally that are potentially

F rom C limate C hange to P overt y and B ack : A F ramework 4 1

affected by a hazard (like the population working in the agricultural sector and thus exposed to reduction in yields)"
15866,WB-2016-9.txt," · Vulnerability: The expected amount of loss, if a hazard occurs"
15867,WB-2016-9.txt, This depends on the physical strength of exposed assets (a mud house tends to be more vulnerable to flood than a brick house); the technologies used (some agricultural techniques are more vulnerable to a decrease in precipitation); and the role of exposed assets for the community's well-being (the loss of a critical bridge typically results in higher losses than the reconstruction value)
15868,WB-2016-9.txt,"
How these three factors evolve is uncertain, given our lack of full understanding about the climate system and impacts of climate change (for instance, on ecosystems)-- as well as how socioeconomic systems evolve"
15869,WB-2016-9.txt, But it is also uncertain because they can be affected by policies and therefore by our current and future choices
15870,WB-2016-9.txt," These two sources of uncertainty have very different implications: while the scientific uncertainty (for instance on how local climates will change and how physical and biological systems will respond) is a bad thing, because it impairs decision making and creates risks, the uncertainty due to our choices is good news, because it shows that our decisions can shape the future of climate change and its impacts"
15871,WB-2016-9.txt,"
These two sources of uncertainty also influence these factors differently at different time horizons"
15872,WB-2016-9.txt," Emissions-reduction policies, even those implemented today, cannot significantly affect the rate and magnitude of climate change by 2030, so that the uncertainty about the hazard comes only from the scientific uncertainty: at this time horizon, reducing climate change impacts can be done only by reducing exposure and vulnerability"
15873,WB-2016-9.txt," But for 2050 and beyond, greenhouse gas emissions and climate policies have a large impact on the climate change hazard: the scientific uncertainty and the policy uncertainty matter for the long-term climate change hazard"
15874,WB-2016-9.txt," To account for these differences, this report uses

different scenarios for the analyses at different time horizons:
· Short-term hazard"
15875,WB-2016-9.txt," In our analyses of the short-term impacts of climate change, by 2030, we use two scenarios for the magnitude of climate change impacts (lowimpact and high-impact scenarios) to represent the scientific uncertainty on how local climates will change in response to global climate change, and how physical and biological systems will respond (such as the effects of higher temperatures on ecosystems)"
15876,WB-2016-9.txt, These scenarios do not depend on emissions and extend to 2030
15877,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Long-term hazard"
15878,WB-2016-9.txt," When analyzing the longer-term, beyond 2050, we use two scenarios for the future of global greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (low-emissions and high-emissions scenarios), which are driven by development trends and climate policies"

15884,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Socioeconomic scenarios"
15885,WB-2016-9.txt," To represent the uncertainty on the exposure and vulnerability, linked to development and adaptation policies, we also introduce two socioeconomic scenarios, the poverty and prosperity scenarios, which describe different possible evolutions of the world until the end of the century, in the absence of climate change"
15886,WB-2016-9.txt," The prosperity scenario is optimistic, assuming that the World Bank's twin goals of extreme poverty eradication and

shared prosperity are met by 2030, that popu lation g row th is slow i n developing countries, education levels and labor productivity increase rapidly, and the productivity gap between developing and developed countries decreases quickly"

15916,WB-2016-9.txt," Encouragingly, it finds that, if socioeconomic trends and policies manage to minimize the exposure and vulnerability of poor people to climate change by 2030, a large fraction of the negative impact of climate change on poor people can be prevented"

In this report, we do not present a detailed discussion of mitigation policies, but chapter 2 touches on the impact of land-based mitigation policies (like fighting deforestation) on poverty, and chapter 6 explores how to design mitigation policies that do not slow down poverty reduction-- in particular by combining mitigation policies with measures to protect poor and vulnerable people against potential negative impacts"

15926,WB-2016-9.txt,"2 A call for zero net CO2 emissions by 2100

The scientific reality is that as long as human societies release CO2 in quantities greater than natural carbon sinks (such as forests and other vegetation) can absorb, the climate will continue changing, with corresponding risks for well-being, development, and poverty reduction (IPCC 2014a)"
15927,WB-2016-9.txt," This is why the international community committed to the goal of keeping global temperature increases below 2°C, and thus to the full decarbonization of the global economy (UNFCCC 2010; G7 2015)"

Because energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves, maintaining global warming below 2°C, or even 3°C, requires immediate action"
15929,WB-2016-9.txt, This requires a radical change in development patterns
15930,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, a background study for this report finds that it will be very difficult to remain below a 2°C warming if the carbon intensity of new development exceeds 73 gCO2/$ (grams of carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of GDP) on average at the global level

(Rozenberg et al"
15931,WB-2016-9.txt," As a reference, the carbon intensity of global GDP today is around 360 gCO2/$"
15932,WB-2016-9.txt," There is no country--except those that outsource emissions (like Singapore or Hong Kong SAR, China)--whose carbon intensity of GDP today approaches 100 gCO2/$"
15933,WB-2016-9.txt, This is true even of countries that produce most of their electricity from nonfossil energy sources (such as Brazil and France)
15934,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Moreover, delaying action locks the global economy into a carbon-intensive pathway--where it becomes increasingly more difficult and expensive to reduce CO2 emissions sufficiently to stay within a low budget of cumulative emissions--because of the long lifetime and relatively high capital cost of energy infrastructure"
15935,WB-2016-9.txt," Each year that additional mitigation efforts are delayed (that is, we continue along the current path), the required carbon intensity of new production decreases by 20 to 50 gCO2/$ for a 2°C budget"

16515,WB-2016-9.txt, Land-based mitigation can also bring risks for food production and prices
16516,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Production and price impacts--whether triggered by climate change or climate policies--significantly affect poor people"
16517,WB-2016-9.txt," Net-consumers of food products will be harmed, while those who depend on agricultural wages and profits will experience mixed impacts"
16518,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· Climate change adds to the stress on ecosystems and makes them even more fragile"
16519,WB-2016-9.txt, Impacts for poor communities dependent on ecosystem-based livelihoods can be large-- cutting their subsistence production and removing one of their safety nets--but are still impossible to quantify
16520,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· In the shorter term, food stocks, better access of poor farmers to markets, improved technologies, and climate-smart production practices can reduce climate impacts"
16521,WB-2016-9.txt," Over the longer term, negative impacts can be avoided only through mitigation actions, including in agriculture, forestry, and other land uses"
16522,WB-2016-9.txt, These actions can be designed to avoid negative impacts or even to benefit local production and incomes
16523,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
What are the key obstacles hindering poor people from escaping poverty and making them vulnerable to falling back into poverty? Household surveys investigating this question reveal that changes in prices, employment shocks, or death of livestock and crop

failures are among the chief culprits"
16524,WB-2016-9.txt," And we know that many of these shocks can be triggered by climate-related events, whose frequency and severity will increase with climate change"
16525,WB-2016-9.txt," In particular, the pace of poverty reduction could be affected by climate change impacts on agriculture and ecosystems"
16526,WB-2016-9.txt,"

This chain of events is expected to occur because climate change will seriously affect land and water productivity"
16527,WB-2016-9.txt," This, in turn, will increase food prices and affect wages and incomes, especially in the agriculture sector"
16528,WB-2016-9.txt, The impact of such changes in prices and earnings on households depends on their consumption basket and income sources
16529,WB-2016-9.txt," Food dominates the consumption basket of poor households, whose livelihoods--particularly in poor countries--are often derived from agriculture and other environmental goods and services"
16530,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This chapter explores how climate change and climate policies could affect poor people through these channels"
16531,WB-2016-9.txt," Importantly, these effects can be triggered either by short-lived natural disasters or by more gradual, longterm changes in climate conditions"
16532,WB-2016-9.txt," While natural disasters are discussed at length in chapter 3, this chapter focuses on long-term changes and trends that threaten poor people"
16533,WB-2016-9.txt," But the line is often blurred between shocks and trends, and the two interact closely"
16534,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, tight agricultural markets--due notably to limited food stocks--make it more likely that a relatively small event in one region (such as a drought in a major exporting country) translates into a food price crisis, as illustrated by the consequences of the 2010 Russian drought"
16535,WB-2016-9.txt,"
We begin by reviewing the possible impacts of climate change and mitigation policies on food security--in terms of agricultural yields, food prices, and food availability--and the consequences for poor households of such changes and the associated impacts on ecosystems the poor depend on"
16536,WB-2016-9.txt," We then examine how socioeconomic development, improved technologies, better infrastructure and market access, and well-designed land mitigation policies could help"
16537,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Our main message is that climate change can have significant impacts on agricultural yields and food prices, as well as ecosystembased livelihoods, which will particularly affect poor consumers and rural people"
16538,WB-2016-9.txt," However, impacts will remain globally limited (but locally significant) until 2030 and can be largely managed through good policies during this period"
16539,WB-2016-9.txt," Beyond 2030, impacts can become

large and well-designed mitigation policies are the only way to reduce longer-term risks"
16540,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Climate change and climate policies will impact food security
Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in many poor countries"
16541,WB-2016-9.txt, It is also directly critical to households' food security
16542,WB-2016-9.txt," Unfortunately, it is also one of the most sensitive to climate change given its dependence on weather conditions, both directly and through climate-dependent stressors (pests, epidemics, and sea level rise)"
16543,WB-2016-9.txt," In fact, some of the most severe poverty impacts of climate change are expected to be channeled through agriculture"
16544,WB-2016-9.txt,"
In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that there is high confidence that all aspects of food security will be negatively affected by climate change (IPCC 2014)"
16545,WB-2016-9.txt," However, the extent to which yields and prices will be affected is hard to predict"
16546,WB-2016-9.txt, Uncertainty about future precipitation and temperature change are compounded by uncertainties regarding the likely response of crop growth to changes in climate conditions
16547,WB-2016-9.txt," Further, the magnitude of CO2 fertilization (that is, the process through which higher CO2 concentrations directly accelerate plant growth) is still unknown"
16548,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, climate change impacts on crop yields and prices are highly uncertain and vary across regions, crops, and adaptation scenarios, depending on crop models, economic models, and underlying assumptions (Nelson et al"

This chapter adds to the rapidly growing knowledge on climate change and agriculture by presenting the results of new modeling exercises undertaken for this report--one on hunger vulnerability (Biewald et al"

Accordingly, Havlík et al"
16562,WB-2016-9.txt, (Forthcoming) show that climate change is likely to have a detrimental impact although impacts remain limited in the shorter term
16563,WB-2016-9.txt, As figure 2
16564,WB-2016-9.txt,"1 shows, in a high-emissions scenario, declines in average crop yields remain limited in 2030 once the positive effect of CO2 fertilization is accounted for, and do not exceed 10 percent even without CO2 fertilization"
16565,WB-2016-9.txt," Beyond 2030, the severity of the damage will depend on the actions countries take to decrease their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions"
16566,WB-2016-9.txt," In a low- emissions scenario, overall crop yield losses could be stabilized at less than 8 percent by 2080 compared to a situation without climate change (and with CO2 fertilization, net gains are even possible)"
16567,WB-2016-9.txt," But if GHG emissions continue to increase on an uncontrolled path (high-emissions scenario), yields could decrease by up to 20 percent (on average 14 percent across climate models) in 2080 even with CO2 fertilization--and up to more than 30 percent without CO2 fertilization"

16596,WB-2016-9.txt,"
What happens to agricultural prices is particularly critical for poverty given their impact on poor households' budget and income"
16597,WB-2016-9.txt," According to the IPCC, changes in temperature and precipitation are likely to result in higher food prices by 2050, but the magnitude remains highly uncertain with increases ranging from 3 to 84 percent without CO2 fertilization effects, and between decreases of 30 percent and increases of 45 percent with CO2 fertilization (IPCC 2014)"

Main Messages

· Natural disasters push people into poverty and prevent poor people from escaping poverty"
17789,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· An increase in natural hazards is already observed and will worsen in the next decades"
17790,WB-2016-9.txt," Some events considered exceptional today will become frequent in the long term, threatening current living conditions"
17791,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· These changes in hazards will affect poor people and our ability to eradicate poverty"
17792,WB-2016-9.txt," Because poor people are often more exposed to natural hazards than the rest of the population, and almost always lose a greater

share of their assets and income when hit by a disaster, natural disasters increase inequality and may contribute toward a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction"
17793,WB-2016-9.txt," · There are many options to reduce risks for poor people; and, although none are easy to implement, they do help reduce poverty and make the population more resilient to climate change"
17794,WB-2016-9.txt," Examples include risk-sensitive land use regulation, more and better infrastructure, better housing quality and formal land tenure, air-conditioning, financial inclusion, and early warning and evacuation"
17795,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
Across the globe, on top of stresses on agriculture and ecosystems, shocks from natural hazards--from droughts to floods and storms--are a major reason why people become and stay poor"
17796,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, evidence suggests that disasters increase poverty (Karim and Noy 2014)"
17797,WB-2016-9.txt," Consider the following examples:

· In Peru over the 2003 to 2008 period, one extra disaster per year increased poverty rates by 16 to 23 percent at the provincial level (Glave, Fort, and Rosemberg 2008)"
17798,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· At the municipal level in Mexico, floods and droughts increased poverty levels by 1"
17799,WB-2016-9.txt,5 to 3
17800,WB-2016-9.txt,7 percent between 2000 and 2005 (Rodriguez-Oreggia et al
17801,WB-2016-9.txt,"

8 0  S H O C K W A V E S

· In Bolivia, the poverty incidence rose 12 percent in Trinidad following the 2006 floods (Perez-De-Rada and Paz 2008)"
17802,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· For coastal communities in the subdistrict of Shyamnagar in the southwest of Bangladesh, after Cyclone Aila hit in 2009, unemployment skyrocketed (from 11 to 60 percent between 2009 and 2010) and per capita income decreased sharply (from $15,000 before the storm to $10,000 after)"
17803,WB-2016-9.txt, The poverty headcount rate increased from 41 to 63 percent between 2009 and 2010 (Akter and Mallick 2013)
17804,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Moreover, recovery is not straightforward for poor people"
17805,WB-2016-9.txt," After Ethiopia's 1984­85 famine, it took a decade on average for asset-poor households to bring livestock holdings back to prefamine levels (Dercon 2004)"
17806,WB-2016-9.txt," While a prolonged shock such as a drought can have longterm impacts, so too can temporary shocks on human capital and poverty (Rentschler 2013)"
17807,WB-2016-9.txt," In Mexico, once children have been taken out of school, even just for a temporary shock such as a flood, they are 30 percent less likely to proceed with their education compared to children who remain in school (de Janvry et al"
17808,WB-2016-9.txt, Temporary spending adjustments by lowincome households can result in permanent shifts--at the expense of the child's human capital and future productivity
17809,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Further, poor households exposed to uninsured weather risk have been shown to reduce investment in productive assets and select lowrisk, low-return activities, perpetuating poverty (Cole et al"
17810,WB-2016-9.txt," 2013; Elbers, Gunning, and Kinsey 2007; Shenoy 2013)"
17811,WB-2016-9.txt," In terms of the impact of disaster risk on poverty, these ex ante impacts can dominate ex post impacts, that is, the losses caused by a disaster (Elbers, Gunning and Kinsey 2007)"
17812,WB-2016-9.txt," This link from natural hazard exposure to poverty may create a negative feedback loop, in which poor households have no choice but to settle in at-risk zones (with cheaper rents) and as a result face increased challenges to escaping poverty"
17813,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Natural disasters are thus one of the critical channels through which climate-sensitive events already affect, and can increasingly affect, the ability of poor people to escape

poverty"
17814,WB-2016-9.txt, An increase in the frequency or intensity of natural disasters is expected because of climate change--which is likely to push more people into poverty and increase poverty headcounts
17815,WB-2016-9.txt," Another key channel, agriculture and ecosystems, was covered in chapter 2, and a third, health, will be explored in chapter 4"
17816,WB-2016-9.txt,"
How can we explain the specific impacts of natural hazards on poor people? And what policy options are available to reduce this vulnerability of poor people, especially in light of climate change? Keep in mind that we are referring to all climate-related natural disasters, regardless of whether they are caused by natural climate variability or man-made emissions, as the two are closely linked and call for integrated risk management strategies that account for climate change"
17817,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This chapter tries to shed light on these questions"
17818,WB-2016-9.txt," It begins with a short review of how climate change will affect natural hazards globally, then explores how these changes will impact poor people and affect the evolution of poverty"
17819,WB-2016-9.txt," It draws on results from original studies that investigate--for the first time at the global level--the exposure differential between poor and nonpoor people, looking at droughts, floods, and high temperature"
17820,WB-2016-9.txt," It also reviews several case studies on past disasters, deriving insights on the greater exposure and vulnerability of poor people, along with policy options to reduce this vulnerability"
17821,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Our main message is that the measures and policies that could be mobilized to help poor people manage natural risks in a changing climate amount to ""good development,"" which would make sense even in the absence of climate change--with the important caveat that the design of such measures and policies needs to take into account climate change and the uncertainty it creates"
17822,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Climate change will worsen natural hazards in most regions of the world
The large-scale changes in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological variables that models project as a result of

17823,WB-2016-9.txt," These impacts have been reviewed in many studies recently, including in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013) and in the three volumes of the Turn Down the Heat reports (World Bank 2015a)"
17824,WB-2016-9.txt, This section briefly reviews the changes in hazards to be expected

Heat waves and cold spells"
17826,WB-2016-9.txt, Climate change will not make all extremes worse in the future
17827,WB-2016-9.txt, Cold spells have serious consequences and are expected to decrease both in frequency and in intensity
17828,WB-2016-9.txt," However, it is almost certain that heat waves will become more frequent and intense in the future in most regions of the world"
17829,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, in North Africa, temperatures considered exceptional today (and that have significant harmful effects on ecosystem function and people's well-being) will become a new normal under a high-emissions (4°C) scenario (World Bank 2014) (map 3"
17830,WB-2016-9.txt," In Europe, the summer 2003 heat wave, which led to more than 70,000 deaths, would become an ""average"" summer at the end of this century under a high-emissions scenario--meaning that by 2100, every other summer would be warmer than the 2003 one"
17831,WB-2016-9.txt,"
In many regions, such massive changes would threaten everyday living conditions-- like the ability to work outside or

in non-air-conditioned facilities during the summer"
17832,WB-2016-9.txt," While no single heat wave or extreme event is ""caused"" by climate change, the effect of climate change on heat waves' frequency and intensity is already detectable and is growing over time (box 3"
17833,WB-2016-9.txt," Water availability depends on more than just precipitation--seasonal cycles, snow packs, and evaporation rates also matter"
17834,WB-2016-9.txt," Because of the variability in local changes in climate, the evolution of droughts will vary depending on location"
17835,WB-2016-9.txt," Overall, however, droughts are likely to become more common-- and it is likely that in many locations where droughts already are an issue the situation will worsen (like the Mediterranean basin, Southeast Europe, North Africa, Southern Africa, Australia, South America, and Central America)"
17836,WB-2016-9.txt," A background paper for this report estimates that under a high-emissions scenario, the number of people exposed to droughts could increase by 9 to 17 percent in 2030 and 50 to 90 percent in 2080 (Winsemius et al"
17837,WB-2016-9.txt,", forthcoming)"

Granted, individual events can never be fully attributed to climate change--even the most dramatic events of recent years would have been possible in a climate with no human influence, simply due to the natural variability of the climate (Hulme 2014)"
17846,WB-2016-9.txt, But recent trends in extreme temperature and precipitation can now be linked with climate change

could improve the resilience of poor people"

Risk-sensitive land use regulations: Critical but challenging to implement
A major reason why poor people often live in riskier areas is cheaper housing"
18172,WB-2016-9.txt," In Ho Chi Minh City, qualitative surveys suggest flooded areas can be much cheaper than nonflooded areas for the same quality of accommodation (World Bank and Australian AID 2014)"
18173,WB-2016-9.txt," In addition, recent experience of a flood can reduce housing prices by around 9 percent (Husby and Hofkes 2015)"
18174,WB-2016-9.txt,"1
In developing countries with informal markets, land scarcity can be particularly acute and land markets function poorly (DurandLasserve, Selod, and Durand-Lasserve 2013)"
18175,WB-2016-9.txt," In these places, it may not be the prices that push poor people into risky places, but simply the availability of land with appropriate access to jobs and services"
18176,WB-2016-9.txt," Informal settlements are often located in hazard-prone locations, such as on hill slopes, close to riverbanks, or near open drains and sewers, as in Pune, Dhaka, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, and Mumbai (Lall and Deichmann 2012; Lall, Lundberg, and Shalizi 2008; World Bank 2007)"
18177,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Land use regulations can help by ensuring that new development occurs in places that are safe or easy and cheap to protect"
18178,WB-2016-9.txt, They can also avoid unchecked urban development that leaves too little porous green space and further increases runoff and flood risk (Lall and Deichmann 2012)
18179,WB-2016-9.txt, But doing so remains challenging for a number of reasons
18180,WB-2016-9.txt,"
First, countries need appropriate data on risk and hazard to identify places that are too risky to develop, or where development is possible provided that buildings and

9 8  S H O C K W A V E S

infrastructure are built following strict rules"
18181,WB-2016-9.txt," Unfortunately, access to risk information still varies greatly and is quite limited in lowincome environments"
18182,WB-2016-9.txt," To address this issue, the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) are investing in risk information"
18183,WB-2016-9.txt," The GFDRR's Open Data for Resilience Initiative supports the creation of GeoNode, a webbased open source platform that makes it easier to develop, share, manage, and publish geospatial data (www"
18184,WB-2016-9.txt," Such initiatives can make a difference locally, by making risk information freely available not only to professionals but also to the public"
18185,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Second, countries need strong institutions that can ensure that land use plans are actually enforced"
18186,WB-2016-9.txt," In most of the world today, risk-sensitive land use plans face strong political economy obstacles, and are only rarely enforced (World Bank 2013, chapter 2)"
18187,WB-2016-9.txt, One of the main obstacles is the asymmetry between the costs and benefits of risk-s ensitive land use planning
18188,WB-2016-9.txt," The costs of flood zoning are immediate, visible, and concentrated, in the form of reduced land values for landowners and higher housing costs for tenants (Viguie and Hallegatte 2012)"
18189,WB-2016-9.txt," In contrast, the benefits occur through avoided losses--which nobody can see--sometimes in the future, and go to unknown people"
18190,WB-2016-9.txt," In such a context, the opponents to flood zoning are usually vocal and well organized while beneficiaries are absent, making the policies difficult to pass and enforce"
18191,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Third, countries need to design land use plans in a way that accounts for the reasons why people decide to live in risky places-- primarily, access to jobs and services"
18192,WB-2016-9.txt," When asked what it would take to consider relocating to a safer, less flood-prone area, 44 percent of households in Mumbai cited transport, along with the availability of health services, schools, and social networks (Patankar, forthcoming)"
18193,WB-2016-9.txt," In Ho Chi Minh City, local and migrant households do not have any plans to move despite high flood risk and health impacts (World Bank and Australian AID 2014)"
18194,WB-2016-9.txt," The reasons, according to most of the 246 survey respondents,

In conclusion
The fact that disasters are often followed by a measurable increase in poverty is not a surprise, considering the findings of this chapter:
· Poor people are often highly exposed to natural hazards, and at the local level they are often more exposed than their wealthier neighbors"
18365,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Poor people lose relatively more from disasters because their livelihood and asset portfolio is more vulnerable"
18366,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· The measures and policies that could be mobilized to help poor people manage natural risks in a changing climate amount to ""good development,"" with the important caveat that the design of such measures and policies needs to take into account climate change and the uncertainty it creates"
18367,WB-2016-9.txt," All of these measures also face significant implementation challenges--but with climate change expected to increase risk in many places, it will become even more urgent to make meaningful progress with these measures"
18368,WB-2016-9.txt,"
One important implication of these findings is that the differential in risk levels between poor and nonpoor people may create a decoupling between aggregate growth and poverty reduction, meaning that the poverty reduction impacts of growth may decrease"
18369,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, where the wealthier can protect themselves against disasters, natural hazards are unlikely to lead to a visible shock on GDP"
18370,WB-2016-9.txt," However, the impact on poorer households, which does not appear in aggregate statistics, may nonetheless lock them into poverty traps, creating or magnifying regional pockets of poverty"
18371,WB-2016-9.txt,"
One of the most striking results is the vulnerability of children to natural disasters"
18372,WB-2016-9.txt, This calls for targeted efforts to protect children in poor families from disasters and avoid irreversible consequences for their lifelong prospects
18373,WB-2016-9.txt," The next chapter expands this discussion to look at health shocks that poor people, and especially children, are exposed to, along with measures that could play a big

role in mitigating the consequences of natural disasters--namely the provision of better health services and care, and universal health coverage"

Main Messages

· Climate change will magnify some threats to health, especially for poor and vulnerable people such as children and the elderly, but large uncertainties remain in what is still an emerging research field"
19129,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Health shocks and poor health contribute to poverty through loss of income, health expenses, and caring responsibilities, so that climate change impacts on health will represent an additional obstacle to poverty reduction and will increase inequality"
19130,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· Development--notably better access to health care and to services such as water and sanitation infrastructure--has the potential to reduce, but not eliminate, the risks climate change poses for health"
19131,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Universal health coverage would contribute greatly to climate change adaptation-- and monitoring and surveillance systems (both in the health and environmental sectors) will be critical to deal with emerging health issues"
19132,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
One reason why people fall into poverty, or cannot leave it permanently, is that they are sometimes affected by health shocks and diseases, or by a death in their household"
19133,WB-2016-9.txt," Illness can reduce human capital through permanent health consequences and disability, which makes it difficult or impossible to

work and reduces productivity"
19134,WB-2016-9.txt," It can also diminish financial assets through medical expenditures, especially in the presence of high borrowing costs (Krishna 2006)"
19135,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Poor people are more vulnerable to health shocks because they have fewer resources with which to maintain good health, have less access to improved water and health care,

and are more likely to depend on labor- intensive livelihoods that require good health such as agriculture or construction"
19136,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, they incur a more severe burden of disease than nonpoor people, and this burden hampers their ability to accumulate and retain assets and improve living conditions"
19137,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Chapters 2 and 3 explored two key channels of poverty--agriculture and ecosystems, and natural disasters--noting that climate change impacts on agriculture and ecosystems and that natural disasters affect health in many different direct and indirect ways, such as through undernutrition due to lower crop productivity, or via the spread of diseases after a disaster"
19138,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This chapter explores how health, the third key channel of poverty in this report, will be affected by climate change"
19139,WB-2016-9.txt," A changing climate can reduce the quantity and quality of water resources, along with altering the susceptibility to, and spatial distribution of, climate-sensitive diseases"
19140,WB-2016-9.txt," And climate change is likely to amplify many of the diseases that already threaten poor households--for instance, by allowing malaria-bearing mosquitoes to spread in new places, or accelerating the replication of pathogens in water"
19141,WB-2016-9.txt, Even climate change adaptation measures can contribute to worsening health conditions
19142,WB-2016-9.txt," Irrigation dams, water storage receptacles, and other land use and water management practices can create suitable conditions for vectors and pathogens to reproduce, thereby worsening the incidence of disease (AsensoOkyere et al"
19143,WB-2016-9.txt, 2011; Keiser et al
19144,WB-2016-9.txt, 2005; Medlock and Vaux 2011)
19145,WB-2016-9.txt,"
These potential impacts of climate change on health are important in and of themselves, as they could directly cause a massive reduction in well-being"
19146,WB-2016-9.txt," But they could also affect households in economic terms, magnifying the initial impact on welfare"
19147,WB-2016-9.txt, This chapter begins by reviewing the evidence on the impact of health shocks and poor health on poverty
19148,WB-2016-9.txt," It then summarizes what we know about the health impacts of climate change and concludes with options to minimize these impacts, including better health infrastructure and universal health coverage"
19149,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Our main message is that economic development--notably better access to health care and to services such as water and sanitation infrastructure--has the potential to reduce, but not eliminate, the enhanced risks that climate change poses for health"
19150,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Disease and poor health contribute to poverty
The impact of poor health on low-income households is already large"
19151,WB-2016-9.txt," In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the number of deaths in children under five is much higher than in other regions, as shown in figure 4"
19152,WB-2016-9.txt," Diarrheal and respiratory diseases, and malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, contribute significantly to this gap"
19153,WB-2016-9.txt," For adults, there is a striking difference in the diseases that affect rich and poor countries"
19154,WB-2016-9.txt," In particular, communicable diseases--including HIV--represent almost half of the cause of mortality for adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, while in richer regions non-communicable diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, dominate (WHO 2015)"
19155,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Over 40 percent of the global burden of disease attributed to environmental factors falls on children under five years of age, most of them living in developing countries"
19156,WB-2016-9.txt," An estimated 800,000 out of the annual 2 million deaths among children under the age of five caused by respiratory infections is due to indoor air pollution; another 760,000 children die as a result of diarrhea (WHO 2013a)"
19157,WB-2016-9.txt," These deaths could be prevented with minimal health care and better hygiene, shifting toward cleaner fuels, and by better access to safe water and improved sanitation"
19158,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Diseases--and more generally poor health--increase poverty for several reasons"
19159,WB-2016-9.txt, Health expenditures can absorb a large share of a household's income
19160,WB-2016-9.txt," Diseases reduce productivity because of missed work and school days, caregiving responsibilities, or reduced productivity"
19161,WB-2016-9.txt," And in the long term, they can impair children's development and reduce their ability to learn, which can affect earnings"

Health care costs are regressive and have large impacts on poor households
Health expenditures absorb a large share of poor households' budget, especially in developing countries"
19165,WB-2016-9.txt," Whereas higher-income countries tend to have more sophisticated social insurance systems to support access to health care, financial risk protection is largely absent in lower-income countries, where about half of health costs borne by households are out of pocket (figure 4"

Support Systems, Safety Nets, and Inclusion

Main Messages

· Poor people struggle more than others to cope with and adapt to climate change and natural hazards: not only are they more exposed and vulnerable to shocks but the support they receive from families, communities, financial system, and government is also weaker, and they are often not granted a voice in decision-making processes"
20888,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Financial inclusion, insurance, social safety nets, and remittances complement each other in protecting different populations against different types of shocks"
20889,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· Given the limits to how much protection the financial system can offer, especially to the poorest, social safety nets are needed to provide effective protection to poor households"
20890,WB-2016-9.txt," To be effective, safety nets must be rapidly scalable, even if speed of delivery may come at the cost of targeting"
20891,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· An adaptive social protection system creates a formal liability for the government, which may need to draw on instruments such as reserve funds, contingent finance, reinsurance products, or even international aid"
20892,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
Poor people are particularly exposed and vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change, such as reduced crop yields, more intense floods, or lower productivity due to extreme temperature, making climate change and disasters a magnifier of existing inequalities"
20893,WB-2016-9.txt," However, these direct impacts tell only part of the story"
20894,WB-2016-9.txt," When people are affected by

a shock or a change in economic conditions (like higher food or energy prices), they may adapt to reduce the losses or even benefit from the changes"
20895,WB-2016-9.txt," Hence, the overall impact on welfare and quality of life also depends on how well people cope and adapt"
20896,WB-2016-9.txt,"
One reason why poor people struggle to adapt to changes in environmental and economic conditions is limited resources--for instance, limited financial resources can push

poor people to live in the most flood-prone areas of cities, even if they are aware of the risk (chapter 3)"
20897,WB-2016-9.txt," In addition, as discussed in the World Bank's World Development Report 2014: Risk and Opportunity, the ability to manage risk also depends on the ""support systems"" available to them: the household, the community, the enterprise and financial sectors, and the state"
20898,WB-2016-9.txt," These support systems are also critical to help individuals and firms adapt to the effects of climate change, cope with the impacts that cannot be avoided, and deal with the potential adverse side effects from emissions-reduction policies"
20899,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This chapter investigates how these systems support people in the face of natural hazards, environmental changes, and economic and policy transitions"
20900,WB-2016-9.txt, It assesses the obstacles that prevent effective risk management and adaptation to environmental and economic changes--and then suggests available policies to help poor people adapt to climate change and cope with its consequences
20901,WB-2016-9.txt," It follows by reviewing the role of financial instruments, social protection systems and safety nets, and migrations and remittances, closing with thoughts on governance and the poor"
20902,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The chapter finds that poor people's disproportionate suffering from climate

change and shocks arises not just from the fact that they are more exposed and vulnerable but also because they receive less support from financial instruments, social protection schemes, and private remittances"
20904,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, in response to flooding and landslides in communities in Nepal in 2011, only 6 percent of the very poor sought government support, compared to almost 90 percent of the well-off (Gentle et al"

20906,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The key message of this chapter is the need for a holistic and flexible risk management strategy--with a range of policy instruments appropriate for different disasters and affected populations (figure 5"
20907,WB-2016-9.txt," Revenue diversification and basic social protection, where it exists, can help households at all income levels cope with small shocks"
20908,WB-2016-9.txt," But, when a shock is larger, these instruments will not be sufficient, and additional tools are needed"
20909,WB-2016-9.txt," For relatively wealthier households, savings will help; and market insurance can provide them with efficient protection for larger losses"
20910,WB-2016-9.txt," However, for the poorest households, savings are often not an option; and high transaction costs make private insurance unattainable"
20911,WB-2016-9.txt,"
For the poorest households--and to cover the largest shocks--well-targeted and easily scalable social safety nets are needed"
20912,WB-2016-9.txt, These systems need to be designed so as to maintain incentives to invest in long-term adaptation to economic and environmental changes
20913,WB-2016-9.txt," Such an adaptive social protection system creates a liability for the government, which may need to rely on financial instruments such as reserve funds (for small-scale events), contingent finance, reinsurance products, or even international aid if its capacity is exhausted"
20914,WB-2016-9.txt," Social protection systems and financial protection have always been needed to help people cope with individual and systemic shocks, including disease and natural disasters, but this

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 4 3

need has been intensified and made more urgent by climate change"
20915,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Saving, borrowing, and insurance help people adapt to changes and cope with shocks, but are not always accessible for poor people
People use financial instruments--notably their savings and assets--to smooth consumption and limit the effects of income shocks"
20916,WB-2016-9.txt," While evidence suggests that this smoothing is significant, it is also far from complete (Kinnan and Townsend 2012; Morduch 1995)"
20917,WB-2016-9.txt," In extreme cases, households have even been found to reduce consumption to protect their assets, thus exacerbating consumption shocks (Zimmerman and Carter 2003)"
20918,WB-2016-9.txt," In general however, financial instruments (such as bank accounts and insurance contracts) can complement informal risk-sharing mechanisms and play a critical role in helping households and firms adapt to climate change, prepare for natural shocks, and recover when affected (World Bank 2013a, chapters 4 and 6)"
20919,WB-2016-9.txt,"
We know that savings at financial institutions tend to be less vulnerable to natural disasters than in-kind savings (chapter 3)"
20920,WB-2016-9.txt," Livestock and housing can be washed away by a flood, while savings accounts are far less likely to be affected"
20921,WB-2016-9.txt," Financial inclusion makes it possible for households to protect their savings and lower the vulnerability of their asset portfolio, so they can cope with income losses while maintaining consumption and avoiding radical coping measures, such as reduced food intake"
20922,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Financial inclusion also enables people and firms to reduce risk in the first place"
20923,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, if changes in rainfall patterns call for adapting farming activities, farmers will need to invest in new machines and seeds, or possibly learn new techniques"
20924,WB-2016-9.txt," Without access to credit, these measures may be unaffordable, thus locking them into activities with declining productivity and income"
20925,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Poor people lack access to savings and credit, but policies can enhance financial inclusion
Unfortunately poor people often lack access to formal financial instruments--possibly because of the cost of bank accounts, large distance and time to access a financial agent, or lack of documentation and mistrust in banks"
20926,WB-2016-9.txt," Some people also prefer to stay in the informal sector, or are not fully aware of the benefits of using financial tools for risk management (Allen et al"
20927,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, in Indonesia, more than 20 percent of households in the top 60 percent of the income distribution saved at a financial institution in 2011, compared to less than 8 percent from the bottom 40 percent"
20928,WB-2016-9.txt, Poor people also have less access to credit when affected by a shock or worsening environmental conditions
20929,WB-2016-9.txt,"
What can governments do? The 2014 World Development Report (World Bank 2013a, chapter 6) discusses the actions that governments can take to help households at all income levels gain access to financial instruments for risk management"
20930,WB-2016-9.txt, Two categories emerge
20931,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Financial infrastructure"
20932,WB-2016-9.txt," To reduce costs and improve trust in the banking system, governments can strengthen the financial infrastructure (including payment and security settlement systems and public credit registries)"
20933,WB-2016-9.txt," Physical access to financial instruments can be improved by using the postal network, and improving infrastructure for hosting financial agents and facilitating transport (roads and public transit)"
20934,WB-2016-9.txt," Wide coverage by mobile phone networks can make financial instruments accessible virtually, by using cellular banking and electronic payment technologies (Gupta 2013)"
20935,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Competition, protection, and flexibility"
20936,WB-2016-9.txt," Governments can help keep service costs low by ensuring fair competition and consumer protection, or by requiring the introduction of low-cost bank accounts for vulnerable populations"
20937,WB-2016-9.txt," Moreover, ensuring convenience and flexibility is critical for accommodating

1 4 4  S H O C K W A V E S

the relatively high frequency at which poor people tend to make deposits and withdrawals, or take out and repay loans"
20938,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, poor households benefit greatly from flexible loan schedules that can be readily renegotiated or forborne in ""hungry months,"" or paid in advance when the household enjoys extra liquidity"
20939,WB-2016-9.txt, Experience from microcredit also demonstrates the benefits from schemes that create self-discipline--like using planned saving schedules (Banerjee and Duflo 2012)
20940,WB-2016-9.txt," Poor people are also less able to protect themselves against fraud and abuse, underscoring the need for adequate and accessible consumer protection schemes"
20941,WB-2016-9.txt," In Mexico and South Africa, the government has established financial ombudsmen to resolve disputes in consumer finance (Brix and McKee 2010)"
20942,WB-2016-9.txt,"
While borrowing can help maintain consumption in the short term, it can also create a debt trap from which poor households have trouble escaping"
20943,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, health shocks are more likely to push people into poverty in the presence of high borrowing costs, precisely because of such trap effects (Krishna 2006)"
20944,WB-2016-9.txt, Stringent borrowing conditions paired with postdisaster destitution mean that poor households affected by disasters are likely to quickly incur high levels of debt
20945,WB-2016-9.txt,"
In Bangladesh after the 1998 floods, borrowing was by far the most common coping mechanism chosen by a sample of 757 households in a postdisaster survey (del Ninno et al"
20946,WB-2016-9.txt," Almost 60 percent of these households were in debt in the months immediately following the floods, with average debt rising to almost 1"
20947,WB-2016-9.txt,5 months of average consumption
20948,WB-2016-9.txt," Furthermore, 57 percent of floodaffected households in the bottom three quintiles resorted to purchasing food on credit"
20949,WB-2016-9.txt," This borrowing mitigated the shock, but higher prices meant that poor floodaffected households consumed less"
20950,WB-2016-9.txt," The financial cost of borrowing was found to vary widely, with interest rates from zero (for many loans from family and neighbors) to an average of 50 percent for loans from banks and cooperatives"
20951,WB-2016-9.txt, Better access to finance ex ante and lower interest rates could have reduced the debt trap and improved recovery
20952,WB-2016-9.txt,"

The development of insurance markets in low-income economies faces many obstacles
To cope with large shocks that affect many people, savings or borrowing may not be adequate"
20953,WB-2016-9.txt," Instead, insurance products can provide protection at a lower cost"
20954,WB-2016-9.txt," However, insurance markets are complex, and behaviors often deviate from what theory suggests, making it challenging to provide appropriate insurance products to poor households or small firms in developing countries, which are often exposed to many risks (Kunreuther, Pauly, and McMorrow 2013)"
20955,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The classical indemnity insurance products are commonplace in high-income countries and are based on the observation of losses, with insurance payments triggered once losses occur"
20956,WB-2016-9.txt, Classical indemnity insurance requires that robust data be available for the insurer to assess risks ex ante--something that is often lacking in developing countries (Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013)
20957,WB-2016-9.txt, And loss assessment may be costly if it requires that an expert visit every victim
20958,WB-2016-9.txt,"
One problem with indemnity insurance is that asymmetric information results in adverse selection and moral hazard"
20959,WB-2016-9.txt," Adverse selection refers to the fact that if the price of insurance cannot be adjusted to the level of risk that clients face-- because the information is unavailable or too costly to collect--then those clients facing more risk will demand more insurance, threatening the sustainability of the insurance scheme"
20960,WB-2016-9.txt," But this problem can be solved by making insurance mandatory, although it will be tough to do in countries with little capacity or where premiums would be particularly high"
20961,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Moral hazard refers to the fact that people protected against the negative impact of a shock could choose to do less to prevent the shock or reduce associated losses"
20962,WB-2016-9.txt," In the case of insurance against natural hazards, moral hazard is mitigated by the fact that households suffer from significant nonmonetary uninsured losses (such as the hassle of relocation and loss of personal property if one's

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 4 5

house is flooded)"
20963,WB-2016-9.txt," In most contracts, it is mitigated further by deductibles, which ensure that the insured face a portion of the losses in case of a shock"
20964,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Even in developed countries, penetration of indemnity insurance against natural hazards remains low, albeit with some exceptions: (i) when insurance is subsidized, as with floods in the United States with the National Flood Insurance Program; (ii) when insurance is mandatory and backed by the g overnment-- such as the Turkish insurance against earthquakes and fires, which is an excellent example of how insurance access can be increased in middle-income countries (box 5"
20965,WB-2016-9.txt,"1); or (iii) when insurance is mandatory, cross-subsidized, and backed by the

government, the case of France's Cat-Nat storm and drought insurance (Paudel 2012)"
20966,WB-2016-9.txt," However, subsidizing insurance can be prohibitively expensive, and the penetration of indemnity insurance is very low in developing countries"
20967,WB-2016-9.txt,"
These problems have led to the development of index-based insurance products, in which insurance payments are not made based on observed losses, but when a physical variable--such as a rainfall deficit or wind speed--exceeds a predetermined threshold (regardless of the existence of losses)"
20968,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, a farmer will receive a predefined insurance payment if rainfall is below a minimum threshold over a onemonth period"

Few countries in the world are more exposed to earthquakes than Turkey"
20971,WB-2016-9.txt, Around 70 percent of its population and 75 percent of its industrial facilities are exposed to large-scale earthquakes
20972,WB-2016-9.txt," Since 1984, direct property and infrastructure losses due to earthquake episodes in Turkey have frequently exceeded $5 billion (in current US$ terms)"
20973,WB-2016-9.txt," The last major earthquake in the Marmara region in 1999 resulted in the loss of 15,000 lives and placed an enormous financial burden on the economy and the government"
20974,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Before 1999, earthquake insurance uptake had traditionally been low in Turkey (at around 3 percent of residential buildings) because households traditionally relied on the government to finance the reconstruction of private property after major natural disasters"
20975,WB-2016-9.txt, This presented massive challenges to government budgets
20976,WB-2016-9.txt," But, in the aftermath of the Marmara earthquake, the government decided to develop a catastrophe risk insurance mechanism to reduce its fiscal exposure to natural hazards--arising from publicly funded reconstruction of private property"

20978,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The World Bank provided financial and technical assistance for creating the Turkish Catastrophe

Insurance Pool (TCIP)--the first national catastrophe insurance pool in World Bank partner countries that provides a stand-alone earthquake insurance coverage to homeowners and small and medium enterprises"

20980,WB-2016-9.txt," Premium rates are actuarially sound, not subsidized, and vary with construction type and property location"
20981,WB-2016-9.txt, Covered risks include earthquakes and fire
20982,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The catastrophe risk financing strategy of the TCIP relies on both risk retention and reinsurance"
20983,WB-2016-9.txt, The TCIP absorbs the first $80 million of losses through its reserves (initially complemented by a $100 million World Bank contingent loan facility) and transfers excess losses to the international reinsurance markets
20984,WB-2016-9.txt," The government covers losses that would exceed the overall claims-paying capacity of the TCIP, which is estimated to be able to withstand a 1-in-350 year earthquake"

schemes have major advantages compared with traditional contracts: (i) transaction costs are reduced because losses do not need to be measured; (ii) individuals are still encouraged to take preventive measures since the payout does not depend on the losses or the actions taken to reduce risks (in other words, there is no moral hazard with index-based insurance); and (iii) the payment decision is simple and objective, making it easier to enforce contracts"
20989,WB-2016-9.txt,"
However, index-based insurance suffers from basis risk (that is, the difference between the payment received by contract holders and the actual losses they suffer)"
20990,WB-2016-9.txt," If the index is well correlated with actual losses, contract holders will receive an adequate insurance payment when (and only when) they have losses"
20991,WB-2016-9.txt," But, in practice, the correlation between losses and payout can be low, because of wide variations in impacts from natural hazards and limitations of hydrometeorological observation systems"
20992,WB-2016-9.txt," This means that people may receive a payment in the absence of losses, or receive nothing even in the presence of large losses--which would be catastrophic for those close to the subsistence level"

20996,WB-2016-9.txt, 2012; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013)
20997,WB-2016-9.txt," Another is that index insurance typically covers only one type of risk, while producers may be exposed to many (like price risk or supply chain risk)"
20998,WB-2016-9.txt," Other reasons include a general distrust in the insurance policy, limited financial literacy, and insufficient understanding of the product"
20999,WB-2016-9.txt, The decision to purchase an insurance contract may hinge on whether the individual has had prior experience with it (especially having received a p ayout) (Karlan et al
21000,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Overall, evidence suggests that the take-up of index-based insurance requires large subsidies, although, as with indemnity insurance, subsidies can make the schemes unsustainable (Brown, Zelenska, and Mobarak 2013; Cole et al"
21001,WB-2016-9.txt, 2012; Cole et al
21002,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Some of these obstacles can be removed by improving technology, policy design, and adopting best practices--for example, modernizing observation systems and improving index designs may reduce the basis risk and strengthen index-based instruments (Barnett, Barrett, and Skees 2008; Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013)"

Social protection schemes are critical for helping people adapt and cope with shocks, but must be flexible and easily scalable

The three main types of social protection are (i) social safety nets (also known as social assistance), which include conditional and unconditional cash transfers, public work programs, subsidies, and food stamps; (ii) social insurance, which consists of contributory pensions and contributory health insurance; and (iii) labor market measures, which include instruments such as unemployment compensation (table 5"

Poor people often lack coverage, or amounts are too small to make a difference
Unfortunately, poorer households often have limited access to social protection and safety nets"
21049,WB-2016-9.txt, One reason is limited coverage
21050,WB-2016-9.txt, Social assistance consistently reaches more poor than nonpoor people (figure 5
21051,WB-2016-9.txt,"2, left panel)-- conditional and unconditional cash transfers specifically target poor households and are increasingly associated with good coverage among households in the bottom quintile (World Bank 2015b)"
21052,WB-2016-9.txt, But the two other types of transfers (social insurance and labor market policies) reach poor and nonpoor households in about the same proportion
21053,WB-2016-9.txt," This does not necessarily mean that those schemes are poorly designed; some programs, such as contributory pensions, are designed for those who can afford to contribute"

21057,WB-2016-9.txt," And conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs that have revolutionized social protection over the last decade are much easier to deploy in rural than in urban areas, given the challenge of targeting the poor in cities, where they often live next door to the wealthier (Gentilini, forthcoming)"
21058,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, even social assistance shows a large range of coverage for poor people: in many countries, coverage does not exceed 50 percent, meaning that half of poor people within a country do not receive any social assistance, and even below 10 percent in many lowincome countries (figure 5"

21136,WB-2016-9.txt, This rapid increase is due to irreversible impacts on children and distress sales of assets (especially livestock)
21137,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Thus, most postdisaster responses have multiple stages, with initial (survival-related) support delivered quickly even at the expense of targeting and accuracy, and reconstruction support provided later with more effort to target support appropriately (de Nicola 2015)"
21138,WB-2016-9.txt," In Pakistan after the 2010 floods, the government implemented the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), a rapid response cash grant program that included two phases to better

balance the urgency of postdisaster support and the need to carefully target the larger transfers supporting reconstruction (see annex 5A)"
21139,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Postcrisis responses need to balance timeliness with targeting accuracy
In the aftermath of a crisis or a disaster, it can be tough to identify those affected and at risk of being pushed into poverty"
21140,WB-2016-9.txt," There are several approaches to targeting beneficiaries, all of which face challenges (table 5"
21141,WB-2016-9.txt," Economic shocks or disaster consequences are often heterogeneous, making geographic or demographic targeting approaches difficult (Alderman and Haque 2006; Grosh et al"
21142,WB-2016-9.txt," Registries with socioeconomic information and precise location are seldom available--and, as in Nepal, there may not even be a reliable street address system"
21143,WB-2016-9.txt, Usual targeting methods (like proxy-mean testing) are based on slowly changing household characteristics (like assets) and are slow and expensive to implement--meaning that they cannot capture sudden changes in income and consumption
21144,WB-2016-9.txt," And affected populations are often displaced in camps or with family or friends, and thus hard to reach"
21145,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Because these approaches will always have inclusion and exclusion errors, grievance appeal mechanisms are critical"
21146,WB-2016-9.txt," In Pakistan, the grievance redress system in the second phase of the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program cut exclusion errors from an initial 61 percent to 32 percent (see annex 5A)"
21147,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Options to manage this challenge include developing--before a crisis occurs--large and flexible social registries that include both potential and existing beneficiaries, the use of self-targeting methods, and the use of subsidies"
21148,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Social registries"
21149,WB-2016-9.txt, These are crucial because they facilitate quickly identifying households that are vulnerable to being pushed into poverty by a disaster

21152,WB-2016-9.txt,"2 Methods for targeting beneficiaries with social safety nets are more or less appropriate during a crisis or after a disaster

Principle

Advantage

Limitation

Means testing and damage assessments

Benefits are allocated conditional on income and the presence or magnitude of losses

High level of accuracy and therefore appropriate in heterogeneous situations Can be adjusted after a shock, taking into account the specificity of the shock and the varying impacts at the household level

Costly (thus only appropriate for large benefits) and requires high administrative capacity It takes a long time to collect the data, so it cannot be applied for rapid response

Proxy-mean testing and damage assessments

Income and losses from the shock are proxied by quantifiable and easily measurable characteristics, such as ownership of a house made of bricks, or visible damages

Verifiable and objective, cheap because based on available data Able to capture heterogeneous situations, if proxies are well selected Captures asset losses from disasters

Focuses on slow-changing household characteristics (for example, assets) that may ignore income shocks Ignores large shocks that may change the statistical relationship between poverty and the selected proxies It takes a long time to collect the data, so data cannot be applied for rapid response

Community targeting

Communities eligible for support are selected, and distribution of benefits is then delegated to the head of a formal or informal community

Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster, based on low-resolution estimates of the impact (leaving local decision makers to identify small-scale needs) Makes best use of local knowledge on needs and priorities Can include nonmonetary dimensions of poverty and nonmonetary impacts of the shock

Works only in sufficiently cohesive communities, and may exacerbate social exclusion and affect authority of local actors Requires an estimate of communitylevel needs, often based on proxy-mean testing at the community level (leading to the same issues as above)

Demographic targeting

Benefits are given based on characteristics such as age or gender

Simple and cheap to administer, and usually popular Appropriate for supporting highly vulnerable groups such as children

Requires good demographic data Inaccurate when impacts are imperfectly correlated with demographics

Geographical targeting

The program covers only inhabitants of specific regions

Simple and cheap to administer Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster, based on low-resolution estimates of the impact

Appropriate only for large-scale shocks with relatively homogeneous impacts Unable to account for household-level vulnerability and heterogeneous impacts Performs poorly where poverty is not concentrated (for example, in urban areas) Can be politically controversial and limit migration and its benefits

Self-targeting

Mainly cash and foodfor-work programs

Simple and cheap to administer, as no registry of beneficiaries is needed Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster Can be used to reduce risks (for example, public work programs that improve drainage) or to reconstruct after a disaster

Cannot be used to deliver large benefits and may stigmatize the affected population Inaccurate or inadequate if the demand for work exceeds supply, as the poorest and most in need are typically excluded Requires the availability of good projects, appropriate for the beneficiaries' skill set

In Brazil, the Cadastro Unico registry includes households with a per capita income below half the national minimum wage, a threshold that is higher than the income eligibility threshold of existing social programs"
21154,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, the registry includes households that are not currently beneficiaries of social protection but are considered to be vulnerable to economic shocks or disasters"
21155,WB-2016-9.txt," Moreover, individuals can register at any time based on self-reported income, thereby reducing transaction costs (Bastagli 2009)"
21156,WB-2016-9.txt," Such a design ensures that the Bolsa Familia cash transfer scheme can be rapidly adjusted when shocks occur, thus acting as an insurance facility for vulnerable households"
21157,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Large social registries make it possible to introduce dynamic targeting, in which potential beneficiaries are segmented--before a disaster or a crisis--into multiple categories, based on their income, assets, location, or occupation (like farmers and fishermen)"
21158,WB-2016-9.txt," Then, the different categories receive a varying level of support depending on the situation"
21159,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, potential beneficiaries can be ranked starting from the poorest, and the number of people provided with support (""how far you go down the list"") can depend on the situation, for instance to provide more people with support during a drought"
21160,WB-2016-9.txt, The level of support in each category can even be based on an objective rule or a weather index (like using cumulative rainfall or a trigger based on wind speed)
21161,WB-2016-9.txt,"
When social registries are not available, an alternative is combining geographical targeting (to concentrate resources in the most affected municipalities or communities) with community targeting (to use local knowledge to concentrate resources on the most affected households)"
21162,WB-2016-9.txt," Pakistan used this approach in the first phase of the CDCP after the 2010 floods, when timeliness was a priority and there was no reliable data on the distribution of losses"
21163,WB-2016-9.txt," The second phase--less urgent but with larger transfers--put a stronger emphasis on targeting, using housing damages as a proxy for livelihood losses (see annex 5A)"
21164,WB-2016-9.txt," This approach, which does not necessitate much institutional capacity, can be done via work programs--which provide jobs and income by putting in place public projects (like road construction, maintenance, irrigation infrastructure, reforestation, soil conservation) or, especially in postdisaster situations, reconstruction tasks"
21165,WB-2016-9.txt," It usually works by offering a below-market wage; people join only if alternative income sources are lacking (Cazes, Verick, and Heuer 2009)"
21166,WB-2016-9.txt," In Côte d'Ivoire, the Highly Labour Intensive Works Program was created to support and rehabilitate 35,000 former combatants via road building and reconstruction work"
21167,WB-2016-9.txt," The key drawback is that works programs fail to reach those who face constraints that prevent them from working (like those facing disabilities, sickness, and exclusion) and who are often the poorest (McCord 2013)"
21168,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The use of works programs as a social protection measure in postdisaster situations requires that cost-effective and socially beneficial projects be readily identified before a crisis strikes"
21169,WB-2016-9.txt," In practice, however, extreme natural events, such as storms or floods, are typically associated with obvious and significant labor needs"
21170,WB-2016-9.txt," Reconstruction of public infrastructure and buildings and the clearing of rubble are examples of needs that can be met by works programs, which can benefit affected poor and vulnerable people (even those with low skills), as well as the wider community"
21171,WB-2016-9.txt," These are widely used to help poor people, especially in the absence of other social protection programs, and not least because they can be simple and quick to implement"
21172,WB-2016-9.txt, The Egyptian food subsidy program was expanded in 2008 to include 15 million additional beneficiaries (Jones et al
21173,WB-2016-9.txt, 2009)--thereby avoiding an increase in the poverty rate from 22 percent to 31 percent due to food price increases
21174,WB-2016-9.txt, Indonesia used a system of generalized subsidies as a safety net during the 1997 financial crisis
21175,WB-2016-9.txt,"
But the drawbacks of subsidies are many"
21176,WB-2016-9.txt, They can lead to waste and corruption
21177,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, analyses of India's Public Food

1 5 6  S H O C K W A V E S

Distribution Program, which provides subsidized food and fuel, found a number of operational challenges--including underprovided entitlements as a result of ""leakages"" of food through the supply chain, commodities being diverted, food getting underweighted, beneficiaries being overcharged, shops being closed, and food falsely being declared out of stock (Drèze and Khera 2015; Government of India 2011; World Bank 2011)"
21178,WB-2016-9.txt,"
In addition, subsidies are often difficult to remove when the crisis is over, and they are an expensive and inefficient tool for supporting poor people because in many cases a large fraction of the funds go to those who do not need them the most"
21179,WB-2016-9.txt," Fossil fuel subsidies, for instance, are typically implemented and publicly justified with the rationale of helping poor people gain access to energy and energy services"
21180,WB-2016-9.txt," But while low energy prices indeed reduce poverty by reducing the cost of energy services, they do so in an extremely inefficient way, since energy is overwhelmingly consumed by the wealthier"
21181,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Thus, it is strongly in the poor's interest to reallocate resources used to subsidize basic goods in order to implement better-targeted and more efficient support measures instead"
21182,WB-2016-9.txt," Ghana's 2005 fossil fuel subsidy reform increased the price of transport fuels by 50 percent, but also included in-kind benefits for the poor--an e xpansion of primary health care and electrification in poor and rural areas, large-scale d istribution of efficient light bulbs, public transport improvements, and immediate elimination of school fees at government-run primary and secondary schools (IMF 2013; Vagliasindi 2012)"
21183,WB-2016-9.txt," Indonesia has introduced programs to mitigate the effects of higher energy prices through subsidized rice, free health care, cash assistance to poor students, and a one-year conditional cash transfer scheme targeting poor households with pregnant women or school-age children (Perdana 2014)"
21184,WB-2016-9.txt, Iran implemented a quasiuniversal cash transfer (about $45 per month per capita) when it reformed its energy subsidies (IMF 2013)
21185,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Building solid social protection systems requires resources but is affordable even for the poorest countries
Governments in poor countries face many competing needs and have limited resources, so the development of social protection and safety net programs needs to be justified carefully"
21186,WB-2016-9.txt," Overall, however, costs are moderate, even in low-income countries--and instruments are available to help governments face the liability created by social protection programs"
21187,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Experience suggests the cost of social protection can be managed"
21188,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, a recent study assesses how much social protection would be needed to support vulnerable people in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel in 2030 (accounting for population growth and socioeconomic and climatic change) (del Ninno and Coll-Black 2015)"
21189,WB-2016-9.txt," It finds that-- assuming that vulnerable people can be protected against the worst effects of droughts with an annual social protection package of $300 per capita (the typical size of such support systems in the region)--1 percent of the region's GDP would be sufficient to cover this population, although more is needed in some countries (figure 5"
21190,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This would be a moderate cost compared with the cost of some short-term coping strategies, such as reduced food intake or suspension of schooling, which can have irreversible, life-long effects, especially on children"
21191,WB-2016-9.txt," While such a social protection package can by no means prevent all negative impacts of droughts, it reduces the need for expensive humanitarian relief"
21192,WB-2016-9.txt," In fact, the total cost of providing this protection to disaster victims in Africa during the period from 2010 to 2013 is lower than what was spent on humanitarian relief measures (del Ninno and Coll-Black 2015)"
21193,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The government's ability to provide social protection to poor households will be greater if the middle class has access to instruments to manage risks, such as private insurance (box 5"

The different instruments for managing risk and coping with crises--from private insurance to unconditional cash transfers--are not substitutes: they are part of the toolbox available to governments, individuals, and firms, and can be used together, depending on the context and the considered risks"
21203,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, some tools can be more appropriate and efficient than others, depending on the probability with which a natural hazard turns into disaster"
21204,WB-2016-9.txt," It is widely accepted that risk-reduction investments--such as physical protection against floods--are more efficient at dealing with frequent events than risk-sharing

mechanisms: one cannot insure against regularly recurring events"

21211,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Well-established private insurance markets can be beneficial for poor populations, even if they lack

direct access: if higher-income households are covered by private insurance schemes, public funds for postdisaster relief can be better focused on supporting poorer households"
21212,WB-2016-9.txt," In Turkey, the fact that all dwellers in urban areas are covered by an insurance product (the TCIP) makes it easier for the government to focus public resources on rural areas, which are poorer and where market insurance would be challenging to introduce"

21229,WB-2016-9.txt," In the Philippines, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund finances a range of disaster-related expenditures but is not able to disburse rapidly in the case of crisis; this is why the government created the Quick Response Fund, which focuses on emergency response (see annex 5A)"

21264,WB-2016-9.txt," Foreign aid includes essential in-kind support (including emergency equipment such as emergency water treatment stations, reconstruction material, equipment and machinery, and emergency relief goods like food, blankets, and clothes), as well as financial aid for social protection and reconstruction costs"
21265,WB-2016-9.txt,"
However, in the past, increases in foreign aid have been low, averaging only a small percent of total economic losses stemming from the disaster (Becerra, Cavallo, and Noy 2013)"
21266,WB-2016-9.txt," Generally, studies have found that increases in financial aid are larger for more severe disasters and for particularly poor countries with limited disaster management capacities"
21267,WB-2016-9.txt," This suggests that these resources are relatively well targeted and not politically biased (Becerra, Cavallo, and Noy 2013)"
21268,WB-2016-9.txt," Nevertheless, increases in foreign aid in response to disasters remain sensitive to media coverage, are hardly predictable, and can be slow to arrive--all of which make it ever more difficult to prepare contingency plans based on available resources"

Climate-Informed Development and Pro-Poor Climate Policies

Main Messages

· In a pessimistic development scenario, climate change could drag more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030"
22259,WB-2016-9.txt," This number can be reduced to fewer than 20 million, if rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development is combined with targeted adaptation actions"
22260,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· The impacts of climate change on poverty by 2030 mostly depend on development policy choices"
22261,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Immediate emissions-reduction policies are needed to reduce the longer-term threat of climate change to poverty and avoid the post-2030 impacts on poverty that development policy alone cannot manage"
22262,WB-2016-9.txt,"

· To ensure that emissions-reduction policies do not slow down poverty reduction, countries need to focus on options that yield local (health or economic) cobenefits and protect poor people from the negative consequences of mitigation policies"
22263,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· In poor countries where domestic resources are insufficient to protect poor people, support from the international community is essential"
22264,WB-2016-9.txt," This is particularly true for investments with high upfront costs that are critical to prevent lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (such as for urban transport, energy infrastructure, or deforestation)"
22265,WB-2016-9.txt,"

Introduction
So far, this report has presented plenty of evidence that unmitigated climate change could become a significant obstacle to development and poverty eradication and-- maybe even more important in a risk-based

framework--that the uncertainty around the potential impacts on poverty, development, and welfare are extremely large"
22266,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Our analysis has been centered on the three channels through which climate-related events already affect the ability of poor people

179

1 8 0  S H O C K W A V E S

to escape poverty: (i) agricultural production, ecosystems, and food security; (ii) natural disasters; and (iii) health"
22267,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Chapter 2 shows that losses in the agricultural sector and spikes in food prices pushed people into poverty in the past, as exemplified by the 2010­2011 episode that increased poverty by 44 million people--and that climate change will likely magnify this threat"
22268,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Chapter 3 discusses how natural disasters are already preventing many households from escaping poverty, with the poor more vulnerable to these events--and how climate change is likely to worsen the situation"
22269,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Chapter 4 shows that climate change will magnify the type of health shocks that are already a serious burden for poor people and poor countries--such as malaria, diarrhea, and stunting"
22270,WB-2016-9.txt,"
These chapters also identify many options to reduce the impact of climate change, especially on the poor and vulnerable--from dikes and irrigation systems to early warning systems, better connection to markets, and universal health coverage"
22271,WB-2016-9.txt," In addition, chapter 5 presents instruments to make the population more resilient to shocks at an affordable cost for public finances--for example, financial inclusion and social safety nets that are scalable and can target people hit by a health shock or a flood"
22272,WB-2016-9.txt,"
The message that emerges from these sectoral and thematic chapters is that poverty is one of the key markers of vulnerability and that much of what is recommended as measures to make people and societies more resilient is simply good development policy"
22273,WB-2016-9.txt," And, given that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsreduction policies have limited impacts on climate change between now and 2030, it is development progress that will be the key determinant of the impacts of climate change on poverty in the short to medium term"
22274,WB-2016-9.txt,"
How much of a difference could good development make to the resilience of individuals and societies? This chapter tries to answer this question--and for the first time,

to give a sense of the magnitude of the impact of development on the vulnerability to climate change impacts"
22275,WB-2016-9.txt, But this report has also shown that there are limits to adaptation
22276,WB-2016-9.txt, The evidence is strong that climate change mitigation action is needed now to prevent much more severe impacts later this century (Fay et al
22277,WB-2016-9.txt, 2015; IPCC 2014; NCE 2014; OECD 2015)
22278,WB-2016-9.txt," This chapter provides thoughts on how mitigation policies can stabilize the climate and the risks it creates, and do so without slowing down poverty reduction"
22279,WB-2016-9.txt,"
By 2030, climate change will increase; but rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can minimize its impact on poverty
Between now and 2030, climate policies can do little to reduce the amount of global warming already under way because of the long lag between the introduction of mitigation policies, their impact on emissions, and the effect of emissions reductions on the climate system"
22280,WB-2016-9.txt," Only changes in short-lived climate pollutants (like black carbon and methane) could have a rapid impact, especially at local scale, but their potential at global scale remains relatively limited (Rogelj et al"
22281,WB-2016-9.txt, This scientific certainty means that the only way to reduce climate change impacts by 2030 is by lowering socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change--through both climate-informed development and targeted adaptation efforts
22282,WB-2016-9.txt,"
We investigate here the potential efficacy of these development policies to reduce the poverty consequences of climate change (full results and technical details of the analysis presented below can be found in a background paper for this report, Rozenberg and Hallegatte, forthcoming)"
22283,WB-2016-9.txt," To do so, we first look at what the future could look like without climate change"
22284,WB-2016-9.txt, We then use the likely impacts of climate change on the poor identified in chapters 2­4 to examine how the aggregate impact of climate change on poverty is affected by overall development progress

The results are unequivocal: the impact of climate change on poverty is conditioned by overall development progress"
22286,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Even without climate change, very different futures can be imagined for poverty and development
It is impossible to forecast future socioeconomic development"
22287,WB-2016-9.txt," Experience suggests we are simply not able to anticipate structural shifts, technical breakthroughs, and geopolitical changes (Kalra et al"
22288,WB-2016-9.txt," Here, we do not predict future socioeconomic change and we do not predict the impact of climate change on poverty"
22289,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Instead, we follow a scenario-based approach that is the basis of all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports"
22290,WB-2016-9.txt," It consists of analyzing a set

of socioeconomic scenarios and exploring how climate change would affect development in each of these scenarios"
22291,WB-2016-9.txt, These scenarios do not correspond to particularly likely futures (box 6
22292,WB-2016-9.txt," Rather, they are possible and internally consistent futures, chosen to cover a broad range of possible futures to facilitate assessing possible orders of magnitude of future climate change impacts"
22293,WB-2016-9.txt," People sometimes refer to these scenarios as ""what-if"" scenarios because they can help answer questions such as: ""What would the climate change impact be if socioeconomic development followed a given trend?"" Our goal is to better understand how the impact of climate change on poverty depends on socioeconomic development, estimate the potential impacts in ""bad"" scenarios, and explore possible policy options to minimize the risk that such a bad scenario occurs"

22297,WB-2016-9.txt," That said, they can still be an important input into decision making"
22298,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, decisions often are not based on average or expected values or on the most likely outputs, but instead on the consequences of relatively low-probability outcomes"

22305,WB-2016-9.txt," While these two scenarios are obviously possible, it is impossible to attribute probabilities to them in any reliable way"
22306,WB-2016-9.txt," The same deep uncertainty surrounds

the future of technologies and most political and socioeconomic trends"
22307,WB-2016-9.txt," In such a context, exploring scenarios without attributing probabilities to them is commonplace"
22308,WB-2016-9.txt," Since the 1990s, the IPCC and climate community have used such long-term socioeconomic scenarios--the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and now the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)--to link policy decisions to their possible outcomes (Edenhofer and Minx 2014)"

22311,WB-2016-9.txt,"
While these scenarios cannot be used to perform a full cost-benefit analysis, they make it possible to elicit trade-offs and to support decision making"
22312,WB-2016-9.txt," For instance, they help identify dangerous vulnerabilities that can be removed through short-term interventions (Kalra et al"
22313,WB-2016-9.txt," In our case here, our two scenarios help us explore and quantify how poverty reduction can reduce the vulnerability to climate change"

By 2030, climate change is not the dominant driver of global poverty but can have a large impact if development is not rapid, inclusive, and climate informed
So how do these sectoral results add up in terms of climate change's effect on future poverty trends? We definitely find that a large effect on poverty is possible, even though our analysis is partial and does not include many other possible impacts (for example through tourism, energy prices, foreign direct investment, or remittances) and looks only at the short term (during which there will be small changes in climate conditions compared with what unabated climate change could bring over the long term)"
22454,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, our overall results show that between 3 million (in the prosperity scenario with low impact) and 122 million (in the poverty scenario with high impact) additional people would be in poverty because of climate change (Table 6"

22507,WB-2016-9.txt," It is true that our analysis does not cover all climate change impacts (like those on ecosystem services) or the entire developing country population (17 percent is left out), yet we still find that more than 100 m illion people may be pushed into poverty because of climate change impacts"
22508,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Second, most of the uncertainty surrounding these impacts comes from development choices made between now and 2030, and can therefore be actively reduced by implementing the right policies"
22509,WB-2016-9.txt," The quantitative impacts of climate change on poverty are much smaller in a world where socioeconomic trends and policies ensure that

development is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed, than in a world where extreme poverty would persist without climate change"
22510,WB-2016-9.txt," Development policies thus appear to be good adaptation policies, in addition to the more targeted sectoral interventions described in previous chapters"
22511,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Pro-poor mitigation policies are needed to reduce the long-term threat of climate change
So far, we have looked only at what occurs by 2030--a period during which emissionsreduction policies have almost no impact on the magnitude of climate change (IPCC 2013)"
22512,WB-2016-9.txt," By this time, climate change impacts also remain moderate compared with what is expected in 2050 and beyond"
22513,WB-2016-9.txt," Indeed, the impacts of climate change will grow with its magnitude, which will continue increasing as long as net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are not reduced to zero"
22514,WB-2016-9.txt,"
While chapters 2 to 5 propose options to reduce these impacts, they also point to the limits of these options"
22515,WB-2016-9.txt," Land use planning faces difficult political economy obstacles, financial constraints make it tough to invest in protection infrastructure, the provision of health care in rural areas remains challenging, and targeting social assistance after a disaster and in emergency conditions will always be difficult"
22516,WB-2016-9.txt," There are clear limits to what adaptation can achieve, and these limits will be tested by climate change"
22517,WB-2016-9.txt," As summarized in IPCC (2014), ""without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally"

Moreover, the long-term impacts of climate change are highly uncertain"

uncertainty is skewed toward catastrophic outcomes: while climate change impacts might turn out to be moderate, they could escalate to extremely high levels and in that case--again--poor people would be the most affected (Pindyck 2013; Stern 2013; Weitzman 2014)"
22520,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Thus, uncertainty is not a reason to delay climate change mitigation action"
22521,WB-2016-9.txt," On the contrary, the need for climate stabilization arises from a risk management approach that takes into account threats created by long-term impacts and the fact that GHG emissions lock us into irreversible warming"
22522,WB-2016-9.txt," These risks-- that remain impossible to quantify in terms of consequences or probability--largely explain why the international community has committed to the goal of stabilizing global temperature (16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC 2010), and thus to the full decarbonization of the global economy (Fay et al"

22530,WB-2016-9.txt," But, beyond this threshold, a major factor in development has been industrialization, which comes with a tighter link between GDP growth and energy consumption growth"
22531,WB-2016-9.txt," And energy is required to fuel hospitals, schools,

transportation, and other productive activities that support development"
22532,WB-2016-9.txt," At high-income levels (above about $10,000 per capita), economies and growth diversify away from manufacturing, and energy consumption increases more slowly with income (Medlock III and Soligo 2001; van Benthem 2015)"
22533,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Looking ahead, can this relationship change through energy leapfrogging? Thanks to technological progress, the energy efficiency of lighting, vehicles, appliances, and industrial processes has improved considerably in the past decades"
22534,WB-2016-9.txt," This means that, when countries that are currently less developed reach the income per capita levels that today's developed countries had, say in the 1960s, they will have access to more energy-efficient technology than was available for developed c ountries at that time"
22535,WB-2016-9.txt," Will this reduce energy consumption associated with future development? So far, there is no evidence of leapfrogging: economic development has not been less energy intensive in follower, developing countries than past growth in leader, now-developed countries"
22536,WB-2016-9.txt, Three factors can explain this result (van Benthem 2015)
22537,WB-2016-9.txt,"
First, developing countries may not fully adopt available efficient technology because their regulations are less stringent, access to technologies remains limited by trade barriers and skill mismatch, and governments investing in infrastructure and firms investing in productive capital face strong constraints in terms of access to capital and financial markets (Fay et al"
22538,WB-2016-9.txt, 2015; World Bank 2012)
22539,WB-2016-9.txt," As a result, they typically favor technologies with lower upfront capital costs, in effect, favoring less energy-efficient technology"
22540,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Second, globalization and outsourcing mean that developing countries today are manufacturing not just for themselves, as developed countries did during their development, but also for the developed world"
22541,WB-2016-9.txt," Their economy thus relies relatively more on manufacturing for exports, which tends to increase energy consumption"
22542,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Third, more efficient technology is offset by increased use of such technology (Gertler et al"
22543,WB-2016-9.txt, 2013; Gillingham et al
22544,WB-2016-9.txt," Developing countries may use more (or larger) cars and refrigerators than developed

countries in the past at similar income levels-- this earlier access of poor people to energy services is one of the positive impacts of higher energy efficiency, but it results in more energy consumption"
22545,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Energy leapfrogging could occur in the future if (i) developing countries enact policies that favor the adoption of cleaner technologies (like performance standards on light bulbs, appliances, buildings, or private vehicles); (ii) they correct other market or government failures that prevent technology adoption (like mandating labels that inform on energy consumption, or removing energy subsidies); (iii) manufacturing patterns become more balanced (for instance if developed countries increasingly use robots to manufacture locally); or (iv) technology adoption in developing countries saturates at lower levels than in developed countries (car ownership may end up being lower in developing countries than in already developed countries if developing countries build mass transit­ oriented cities)"
22546,WB-2016-9.txt, But the evidence suggests that energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves
22547,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Policies are thus needed to make development and climate change stabilization compatible"
22548,WB-2016-9.txt," Energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves, and maintaining global warming below 2°C, or even below 3°C, will require reducing emissions to zero by 2100 (figure 6"

In conclusion
This report provides new quantification of how climate change will affect poor people and poverty through agricultural impacts (chapter 2), natural disasters (chapter 3), and health shocks (chapter 4)"
22742,WB-2016-9.txt," In each of these chapters, it also identifies opportunities for better policies or specific interventions that can reduce these impacts, sometimes even below their current levels in spite of climate change"
22743,WB-2016-9.txt, Chapter 5 builds on these sectoral solutions by exploring cross-cutting options to enhance resilience (like financial inclusion and social safety nets)
22744,WB-2016-9.txt," It also identifies options to adapt to a context of changing climate with more frequent and intense shocks and changing environmental conditions, like permanently reduced rainfall"
22745,WB-2016-9.txt, And it stresses the need for a governance system that gives a voice to poor people
22746,WB-2016-9.txt,"
This report suggests that developing countries have a window of opportunity to build resilience and reduce short-term climate change impacts on poverty through development policies that are inclusive and climate informed"
22747,WB-2016-9.txt," For governments, two implications emerge:
· Greater urgency in reducing poverty and providing poor people with opportunities, basic services, and well-designed social safety nets to reduce their vulnerability before climate change impacts become much larger"
22748,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· The critical importance of ensuring that investments and development patterns are not creating future vulnerabilities as environmental and climate conditions change"
22749,WB-2016-9.txt,"
In parallel, the international community can do much to ensure that development is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed"
22750,WB-2016-9.txt, It can offer resources for climate risk analysis and project preparation; and it can ensure that financing instruments and support are available to cover higher upfront costs
22751,WB-2016-9.txt,"
However, in the absence of mitigation policies, risks for development and poverty eradication will only grow over time"
22752,WB-2016-9.txt," This means

that countries need to act now to reduce their emissions, using two approaches:
· Focus on emissions-reduction options that create synergies with development or yield health or economic cobenefits--like using renewable power and minigrids in remote rural areas, or switching to energy- efficient light bulbs and appliances"
22753,WB-2016-9.txt,"
· Protect poor people--for instance by strengthening social protection and cash transfers, possibly financed with energy taxes or fossil fuel subsidy removal"
22754,WB-2016-9.txt,"
But the second approach will be particularly challenging for low-income countries, because they sometimes lack the capacity or simply the resources to implement substantial redistribution policies"
22755,WB-2016-9.txt," The international community should support costly emissions reduction in these countries, especially investing in long-lived low-carbon infrastructure (like urban public transit in cities), because waiting will only make low-carbon development more expensive over the long term"
22756,WB-2016-9.txt,"
Bringing together the short- and long-run view, this report overall emphasizes the negative impact of climate change on poverty eradication, and the risk that unabated climate change creates for the objective of eradicating extreme poverty"
22757,WB-2016-9.txt," In parallel, it also identifies many policy options that can be implemented and would make it possible to achieve our poverty objectives in spite of climate change"
22758,WB-2016-9.txt," Doing so implies a combination of (i) rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development and targeted adaptation interventions to cope with the short-term impacts of climate change; and (ii) pro-poor mitigation policies to limit long-term impacts and create an environment that allows for global prosperity and the sustainable eradication of poverty"

The Heat Confronting the New Climate Normal











Foreword

23411,WBG-2014-4.txt,"
   As the planet warms, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes which occur once in hundreds of years, if ever, and considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the “new climate normal” as we approach 4°C—a frightening world of increased risks and global instability"
23412,WBG-2014-4.txt,"
   The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change, diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise"

23460,WBG-2014-4.txt," The task of promoting human development, of ending poverty, increasing global prosperity, and reducing global inequality will be very challenging in a 2°C world, but in a 4°C world there is serious doubt whether this can be achieved at all"

23464,WBG-2014-4.txt," But, the time to act is now"
23465,WBG-2014-4.txt,"
 This report focuses on the risks of climate change to development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia"
23466,WBG-2014-4.txt, Building on earlier Turn Down the Heat reports this new scientific analysis examines the likely impacts of present day (0

Scope of the Report
This third report in the Turn Down the Heat series1 2 3 4 covers three World Bank regions: Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); and parts of Europe and Central Asia (ECA)"

23470,WBG-2014-4.txt," While covering a range of sectors, special attention is paid to projected impacts on food and energy systems, water resources, and ecosystem services"
23471,WBG-2014-4.txt, The report also considers the social vulnerability that could magnify or moderate the climate change repercussions for human well-being
23472,WBG-2014-4.txt, The report complements the first Turn Down the Heat report (2012) that offered a global overview of climate change and its impacts in a 4°C world6 and concluded that impacts are expected to be felt disproportionately in developing countries around the equatorial regions
23473,WBG-2014-4.txt," Also, it extends the analysis in the second report (2013) that focused on the consequences of climate change for present day, 2°C, and 4°C warming above pre-industrial levels in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South East Asia and demonstrated the potential of early onset of impacts at lower levels of warming"
23474,WBG-2014-4.txt,"
    This analysis draws on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Working Group reports released in 2013 and 2014, as well as peer-reviewed literature published after the cutoff dates for AR5"
23475,WBG-2014-4.txt, The few cases where there are significant differences in interpretation of projected impacts from the IPCC assessments (such as for sea-level rise and El Niño) are highlighted and explained
23476,WBG-2014-4.txt,"
The Global Picture
This report reaffirms earlier assessments, including the IPCC AR5 and previous Turn Down the Heat reports, that in the absence of near-term mitigation actions and further commitments to reduce emissions the likelihood of 4°C warming being reached or exceeded this century has increased"
23477,WBG-2014-4.txt, Under current policies there is about a 40 percent chance of exceeding 4°C by 2100 and a 10 percent chance of exceeding 5°C
23478,WBG-2014-4.txt,"7 However, many of the worst projected climate impacts in this report could still be avoided by holding warming below 2°C"

Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems
World Health Organization



Introduction
 This document presents the World Health Organization (WHO) Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems"
24491,WHO-2015-1.txt, The framework responds to the demand from Member States and partners for guidance on how the health sector and its operational basis in health systems can systematically and effectively address the challenges increasingly presented by climate variability and change
24492,WHO-2015-1.txt," This framework has been designed in light of the increasing evidence of climate change and its associated health risks (1); global, regional and national policy mandates to protect population health (2); and a rapidly emerging body of practical experience in building health resilience to climate change (3)"
24493,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
 Primarily intended for public health professionals and health managers, this framework would also help guide decision-makers in other health-determining sectors, such as nutrition, water and sanitation, and emergency management"
24494,WHO-2015-1.txt," International development agencies could use this framework to focus investments and country support for public health, health system strengthening and climate change adaptation"
24495,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
 The objective of this framework is to provide guidance for health systems and public health programming to increase their capacity for protecting health in an unstable and changing climate"
24496,WHO-2015-1.txt," By implementing the 10 key components laid out in this framework, health organizations, authorities and programmes will be better able to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and manage climate-related health risks"
24497,WHO-2015-1.txt, Least developed countries and countries in the process of developing the health components of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (4) may find this document particularly useful in their efforts to design a comprehensive response to the risks presented by short-term climate variability and long-term climate change
24498,WHO-2015-1.txt,"

Background
2"
24499,WHO-2015-1.txt,"1 Public health rationale
There is clear evidence that human actions, principally the burning of fossil fuels and associated release of climate pollutants, are causing significant changes in global climate"
24500,WHO-2015-1.txt, This in turn is creating observed consequences in environmental and social conditions across all continents (5)
24501,WHO-2015-1.txt," As many of the largest health concerns are strongly influenced by weather and climate conditions, this inevitably presents risks for human health that can be grouped into:
Direct impacts, such as those arising from damages and illness due to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events"
24502,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Environmental system mediated impacts, such as rising air pollution and changing patterns of vector-, food- and water-borne diseases"
24503,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Socially mediated effects that occur via effect of climate change on social and human systems, such as health effects resulting from undernutrition, occupational heat stress and mental illness, as well as potential increases in population displacement, slowing of economic growth and poverty aggravation"
24504,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Table 1 shows some of the main climate-related health risks, that have been assessed as having medium-to-strong evidence by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"
24505,WHO-2015-1.txt," In addition, the IPCC identifies a series of key reasons for concern with regard to effects of climate change which are either particularly severe or irreversible (5)"
24506,WHO-2015-1.txt," This includes the potential: (i) increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as storms and floods causing mass displacement and disruption of livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island states due to storm surges and rise in sea level; (ii) breakdown of food systems resulting in food shortages and volatile prices, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; (iii) potential increase in risk of violent conflict associated with resource scarcity and population movements; and (iv) slowing down of economic growth and exacerbation of poverty, with associated reversal of global health progress, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and the objectives of the forthcoming post-2015 development agenda"
24507,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Overall, climate change is expected to significantly increase health risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and populations"
24508,WHO-2015-1.txt," They will also disproportionately affect vulnerable groups within each country, including the poor, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions"
24509,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Despite these challenges, a lot can be done to protect deterioration of health due to climatic conditions"
24510,WHO-2015-1.txt," Over the long term, mitigation is necessary to avoid continued degradation of the environmental determinants of health"
24511,WHO-2015-1.txt, In the short-to-medium term (i
24512,WHO-2015-1.txt, up to the next 20-30 years) well-planned adaptation measures can avoid much of the projected health impacts
24513,WHO-2015-1.txt,"

2 Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems



This operational framework can be used by all health systems, but is particularly oriented to support those in low- and middle-income countries, which often already face challenges to adequately prepare for health emergencies and control disease burdens, provide coverage of basic healthcare and public health services, manage inequity, and use resources in a cost- effective way"
24514,WHO-2015-1.txt, Health systems with such challenges are at particularly high risk for future setbacks and losses in health achievements gained
24515,WHO-2015-1.txt," And, in these locations building of resilience would need to start with reducing existing health system vulnerabilities"
24516,WHO-2015-1.txt,"2 Policy context
The operational framework responds to policy mandates at global, regional and (increasingly at) national levels"
24517,WHO-2015-1.txt," It includes the World Health Assembly (WHA) and WHO regional committee resolutions on health protection from climate change, strengthening national health emergency and disaster management capacities for managing the risks of meteorological and other extreme events, health system strengthening and implementation of International Health Regulations (2,7)"
24518,WHO-2015-1.txt," It also responds to the requests by parties to the UNFCCC regarding provision of support in planning adaptation to climate change in key sectors, including health"
24519,WHO-2015-1.txt," Additionally, it responds to the post-2015 development agenda and associated Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction"
24520,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
This document therefore aims to support national ministries of health and their partners to identify the key functions that need to be strengthened in order to provide a comprehensive public health response to climate change, within an overall intersectoral NAP (4)"

The goal is to enhance the capacity of health systems to protect and improve population health in an unstable and changing climate"
24523,WHO-2015-1.txt," Ultimately, health systems should be increasingly strengthened and continue to be efficient and responsive to improve health, reduce inequities and vulnerability, and provide adequate social and financial protection, in light of the shocks and stresses they may face from climate variability and change"

24528,WHO-2015-1.txt,"2 Introducing a resilience approach

What is resilience?
IPCC defines ‘resilience’ as the “capacity of a social-ecological system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation"
24529,WHO-2015-1.txt," ” (6)

In the simplest terms, resilience refers to the holistic ability and agility of a system to change and flex - according to circumstances - and continue to function under stress, while undergoing change"
24530,WHO-2015-1.txt, Resilience is much more than just the absence of vulnerability; it is about whole system capacity
24531,WHO-2015-1.txt,"
Adaptations to climate change and climate resilience building are closely related, but not synonymous"
24532,WHO-2015-1.txt," Adaptation"" as defined by the IPCC inits Fifth assessment report, is the “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects"
24533,WHO-2015-1.txt," In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities"

Foreword



The dramatic impact of climate variability and climate change continued to be felt all over the world throughout 2013"
24893,WMO-2014-3.txt, The WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2013 provides a snapshot of global and regional trends in weather and climate over the past year and highlights some of the year's most significant extreme events
24894,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warm - est since global records began in 1350"
24895,WMO-2014-3.txt," Although the climate varies naturally from year to year, it is clear that the planet is experiencing an overall warming trend"
24896,WMO-2014-3.txt," Thirteen of the fourteen warmest years on record have all occurred in the twenty-first century, and each of the past three decades has been warmer than the last, culminating with 2001-2010 as the warmest decade on record"
24897,WMO-2014-3.txt," As highlighted by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this steady warming is caused by rising levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere"
24898,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
We now have a better understanding of hum an- induced climate change, and climate scientists can increasingly determine how large-scale pressure and temperature patterns influence the weather"
24899,WMO-2014-3.txt," The best known of these is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean, which affects weather patterns around the world through ""teleconnections"""
24900,WMO-2014-3.txt," I n addition to EN SO, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, jet streams and other recurring patterns also often explain why weather conditions are wetter, drier, warmer, cooler or stormier than average"
24901,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

Weather forecasting, including the prediction of storms and other hazards, has greatly evolved in recent years"
24902,WMO-2014-3.txt," In October 2013, the events surrounding Cyclone Phaifin, the second strongest tropical cyclone to strike India since modern records began, showed how improved forecasting, combined with government action to build national resilience and provide shelters, greatly reduces the loss of life"
24903,WMO-2014-3.txt," Nevertheless, extreme events can still cause fatalities and destroy property, so we must continue enhancing preparedness, strengthening early warning systems and implementing a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk reduction"

Preface



This Statement is based on datasets and information that were made available by WMO Members and partners for 2013 and assessed in their global and regional geographical context"
24908,WMO-2014-3.txt, Comparisons were made with climatological averages and records (historical background) whenever possible and appropriate
24909,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The global temperature assessment is based on three independent datasets that are maintained by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (HadCRU), both in the United Kingdom; the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCDC-NOAA), based in the United States; and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), also in the United States"
24910,WMO-2014-3.txt," The HadCRU dataset extends back to 1850, and the NCDC and GISS datasets (and hence the combined dataset) extend back to 1880"
24911,WMO-2014-3.txt, Other datasets have also been used for additional analysis
24912,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The content was developed and peer-reviewed by several experts affiliated with international and regional climate institutions, centres and programmes, and by the world's National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), the main providers of the underlying observations and climate information"
24913,WMO-2014-3.txt, More than 50 NMHSs provided direct input to the Statement following the WMO call for contributions
24914,WMO-2014-3.txt," Many others made their data and climate reports available on their websites, and these were accessed when necessary"
24915,WMO-2014-3.txt," When doubts arose as to facts and figures, WMO communicated with the relevant national source in order to verify the information before its inclusion in the Statement"
24916,WMO-2014-3.txt," The definition of the Regions is based on the WMO regional structure, as follows:
• Africa (Region I)
• Asia (Region II)
• South America (Region III)
• North America, Central America and the Caribbean (Region IV)
• South-West Pacific (Region V)
• Europe (Region VI)
WMO Climate System Monitoring uses Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) as defined by the Global Climate Observing System"
24917,WMO-2014-3.txt, Some 50 ECVs have been identified as fundamental for global observation
24918,WMO-2014-3.txt," This Statement incorporates assessments of the status of the global climate and observed extremes detected using ECV data and products, including air temperature, precipitation, stratospheric ozone and long-lived greenhouse gases (atmospheric ECVs); snow cover, ice sheets and soil moisture (terrestrial ECVs); as well as sea ice, sea level rise, sea surface temperature and ocean acidification (oceanographic ECVs)"
24919,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

TEMPERATURES
The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warmest since global records began in 1850"
24920,WMO-2014-3.txt, The global average surface temperature was 0
24921,WMO-2014-3.txt,50°C ±0
24922,WMO-2014-3.txt,10°C (0
24923,WMO-2014-3.txt,90°F ±0
24924,WMO-2014-3.txt,18°F) above the 1961-1990 average and 0
24925,WMO-2014-3.txt,03°C (0
24926,WMO-2014-3.txt,05°F) above the 2001-2010 average
24927,WMO-2014-3.txt," The past year was also warmer than both 2011 and 2012, which, though marked by cooling La Niña conditions, were 0"
24928,WMO-2014-3.txt,43°C and 0
24929,WMO-2014-3.txt,"46°C above average, respectively"
24930,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Warming El Niño and cooling La Niña events are major drivers of natural variability in the climate system"
24931,WMO-2014-3.txt," Neither condition was present during 2013, which was among the four warmest ENSO-neutral years on record"
24932,WMO-2014-3.txt," Thirteen of the fourteen warmest years on record, including 2013, have all occurred in the twenty-first century"
24933,WMO-2014-3.txt," The warmest on record are 2010 and 2005, followed by 1998"
24934,WMO-2014-3.txt," El Niño conditions dominated the early months of 2010 and 1998, and weak El Niño-type conditions extended from 2004 to the first half of 2005"
24935,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
To arrive at these figures, WMO takes an average of the three main global temperature datasets, which are managed separately and use different methodologies"
24936,WMO-2014-3.txt, Other datasets produce similar but slightly different results
24937,WMO-2014-3.txt," A separate temperature analysis conducted by the Japan Meteorological Agency, for example, estimates that 2013 was the second warmest year on record"
24938,WMO-2014-3.txt," According to reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2013 tied with 1998 as the fourth warmest since 1958"
24939,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Because the capacity for heat absorption differs over land and over sea, the air over the land tends to warm up faster"
24940,WMO-2014-3.txt," Across the world's land surfaces, the 2013 global air temperature was 0"
24941,WMO-2014-3.txt,85°C ±0
24942,WMO-2014-3.txt,17°C above the 1961-1990 average and 0
24943,WMO-2014-3.txt,"06°C above the 2001-2010 average, the fourth highest on record"
24944,WMO-2014-3.txt, A very warm November-December period that ranked second behind 2006 contributed to this high temperature anomaly
24945,WMO-2014-3.txt," Over the global ocean, the surface temperature for 2013 tied with 2004 and 2006 as the sixth warmest on record, at 0"
24946,WMO-2014-3.txt,35°C ±0
24947,WMO-2014-3.txt,07°C above the 1961-1990 average
24948,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The northern hemisphere's weather patterns during early 2013 were largely influenced by the Arctic Oscillation"
24949,WMO-2014-3.txt," This brought cooler- than-average spring temperatures to much of Europe, the south-eastern United States, north-western Russian Federation and parts of Japan"
24950,WMO-2014-3.txt," The Arctic region, meanwhile, was considerably warmer than average, along with much of central and northern Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, southern Russian Federation and much of China"
24951,WMO-2014-3.txt," This so-called warm Arctic, cold continents pattern is characteristic of the Arctic Oscillation's negative phase"
24952,WMO-2014-3.txt, The year 2013 saw the most negative Arctic Oscillation on record for the month of March
24953,WMO-2014-3.txt," A similar pattern with high pressure over Greenland and low pressure to the south re-emerged in late spring, once again causing cold Arctic air to surge into western and central Europe"
24954,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
In the southern hemisphere, summer was extremely warm, with monthly January temperature anomalies reaching +5°C in parts of Australia"
24955,WMO-2014-3.txt," Exceptional warm conditions were also present during the winter, with New Zealand experiencing its warmest winter on record"
24956,WMO-2014-3.txt," The beginning of austral summer 2013/2014 was very hot in parts of South America, with the December temperature reaching new record highs"
24957,WMO-2014-3.txt," As a result of the continued warmth throughout the year across parts of the southern hemisphere, 2013 was the warmest year on record in Australia, second warmest in Argentina and third warmest in New Zealand"
24958,WMO-2014-3.txt, Modelling experiments have indicated that the odds of the record Australian hot summer occurring were increased fivefold by human-induced climate change (see page 20 and accompanying figure)
24959,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

RAIN, SNOW AND ICE
Global precipitation during 2013 equalled the 1961-1990 average of 1 033 mm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (United States)"
24960,WMO-2014-3.txt," Precipitation at the regional level, however, varied significantly"
24961,WMO-2014-3.txt," For example, wetter-than-average conditions were seen across most of Greenland, the southern Arabian Peninsula, central India and western China"
24962,WMO-2014-3.txt," Drier-than-average conditions were present over the western United States, much of northern Canada, northern Siberia and the eastern inland of Australia"
24963,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Winter snow cover in North America has varied widely over the past few years"
24964,WMO-2014-3.txt," During the 2012/2013 winter, snow cover extent was 500 000 km2 above the 1931-2010 average, resulting in the fourteenth largest winter extent for the continent since records began in 1966"
24965,WMO-2014-3.txt, During the spring
24966,WMO-2014-3.txt," North Am erican snow cover was 330 000 km2 above average, making it the tenth largest spring extent for the continent and the largest since 1997"
24967,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
During the same period, snowcover extent across the Eurasian continent was 1"
24968,WMO-2014-3.txt,"71 million km2 above the 1931-2010 average, the third largest winter extent on record for this region and the largest since 2003"
24969,WMO-2014-3.txt," In the spring, the continent's snow cover contracted significantly to 430 000 km2 below average, resulting in the fourteenth smallest extent on record for the season"
24970,WMO-2014-3.txt," In May,Eurasian snow cover dipped to 7"
24971,WMO-2014-3.txt,"3 million km2, setting a new record low for that month"
24972,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
As further evidence of the rapid response of the Arctic cryosphere to increasing air temperatures, the northern hemisphere June snow cover is currently decreasing at a faster rate than Arctic summer minimum sea-ice extent, and at rates that exceed the projection of climate models"
24973,WMO-2014-3.txt," June 2013snowcover across the hemisphere was the second lowest, greater only than the record low of 2012"
24974,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Soil moisture is a key variable for monitoring the climate system because it strongly influences the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere"
24975,WMO-2014-3.txt," Very wet soil conditions resulting from hydro-meteorological events were noticeable and had an impact on floods in a number of regions including eastern parts of the Russian Federation, north-eastern China, India, the Philippines and central Europe"
24976,WMO-2014-3.txt," On the other hand, annual soil moisture anomalies indicated dryness in the southern hemisphere, where Australia, South America and southern Africa experienced severe drought conditions during the first part of the year"
24977,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

Arctic sea-ice extent reached its annual maxim um on 15 March at 15"
24978,WMO-2014-3.txt,13 million km2
24979,WMO-2014-3.txt, This was approximately 0

24982,WMO-2014-3.txt,"72 million km2, the largest seasonal increase on record; this growth can be explained by the record small sea-ice extent of September 2012"
24983,WMO-2014-3.txt, Arctic maximum sea-ice extent in March has decreased at an average rate of 2
24984,WMO-2014-3.txt,6 percent per decade
24985,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Another way to assess the state of the Arctic sea ice is to estimate the age of the ice, given that first-year ice is the thinnest and most susceptible to melting"
24986,WMO-2014-3.txt, Ice that was four years of age and older decreased from 13 per cent of the ice cover in March 1934 to 2 per cent in March 2012
24987,WMO-2014-3.txt, It increased slightly to 3 per cent in 2013
24988,WMO-2014-3.txt," In March 1934, 56 per cent of the ice pack was composed of first-year ice, while in March 2013 first-year ice comprised 73 percent of total ice cover at its peak"

24992,WMO-2014-3.txt, September Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased at an average rate of 13
24993,WMO-2014-3.txt,7 per cent per decade
24994,WMO-2014-3.txt," The total minimum sea-ice volume, which combines measures of ice extent and model simulations of ice thickness, was higher in 2013 than in 2010,2011 and 2012, but lower than in 2007 and well below the 1979-2012 average"
24995,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
February marked the end of the Antarctic sea-ice melt season in 2013"

25005,WMO-2014-3.txt,"

Scientists believe that changes in atmospheric circulation over the past three decades, which have weakened the prevailing winds that circle Antarctica, may be a factor"
25006,WMO-2014-3.txt, The increasing extent of the ice may also be linked to changing ocean circulation and a build-up of cold freshwater on the surface of the Southern Ocean due to increasing precipitation and melting land-based ice shelves
25007,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Melting at the surface of the Greenland ice sheet was much less dramatic in 2013 than in the record year of 2012"
25008,WMO-2014-3.txt," It peaked in late July, when satellites detected melting over 44 per cent of the surface"
25009,WMO-2014-3.txt, This coincided with record warmth in south-western Greenland (30 July saw a temperature of 25

OCEANS
The ocean acts as an effective buffer for the climate system by absorbing and storing a large amount of excess carbon and heat from the atmosphere"
25013,WMO-2014-3.txt, It has absorbed approximately one quarter of all the carbon dioxide <C02) released into the atmosphere by humans since the start of the industrial revolution
25014,WMO-2014-3.txt," This absorbed C02 forms a weak carbonic acid, which causes ocean acidification"
25015,WMO-2014-3.txt," As a result, the pH of the ocean has decreased by 0"
25016,WMO-2014-3.txt,"11, which corresponds approximately to a 30 per cent increase in acidity"
25017,WMO-2014-3.txt," Ocean acidification is already harming corals, shellfish and other marine life"
25018,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
While the rate at which surface air temperatures are rising has slowed in recent years, heat continues to be trapped in the Earth system, mostly as increased ocean heat content"
25019,WMO-2014-3.txt, About 93 per cent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system between 1971 and 2010 was taken up by the ocean

THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE
In 2012, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), which is sponsored by WMO, the Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Council for Science, identified six grand challenges within the climate science community"
25235,WMO-2014-3.txt, The prediction and attribution of extreme events is one of these grand challenges
25236,WMO-2014-3.txt," Extreme climate events that have large impacts on society, both physically and economically, are increasingly requiring prompt and credible scientific explanations"
25237,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Today, there is a growing ability within the climate science community to untangle the complexities of understanding the natural and human-induced factors contributing to specific extreme weather and climate events"
25238,WMO-2014-3.txt, Recent analyses of various events show that the effects of natural weather and climate fluctuations played a key role in the intensity and evolution of many extreme events
25239,WMO-2014-3.txt," However, for some events, the analyses revealed compelling evidence that human-caused climate change, due to the emission of heat-trapping gases, also contributed"
25240,WMO-2014-3.txt, Understanding the influences on such events helps us to better understand how and why extreme events are changing
25241,WMO-2014-3.txt," In addition, calculating how the odds of a particular extreme event have changed provides a way to quantify the influence of climate change on these events"
25242,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The Australia summer 2012/2013 area-averaged surface air temperature was the hottest since national records began in 1910"
25243,WMO-2014-3.txt," In addition to the summer, temperature records were also broken on daily and monthly timescales"
25244,WMO-2014-3.txt," Later in 2013, new national 12-month period temperature records were set in three consecutive months: for the period ending in August, then in September and once again in October"
25245,WMO-2014-3.txt," Lastly, a new calendar-year record was set at the end of 2013"
25246,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Contributing factors to these record 2013 Australian temperatures, including

human-induced climate change and natural variability associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), were investigated using a suite of climate model simulations"
25247,WMO-2014-3.txt," Using nine state-of-the-art global climate models that participated in the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, changes in the probability of extreme Australian summer temperatures due to human influences were investigated"
25248,WMO-2014-3.txt, These nine models simulate well the observed probability distribution of Australian average summer and 12-month average temperatures since 1910
25249,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The probability of hot Australian summers was calculated for model experiments incorporating human influences (changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and ozone in the atmosphere) and natural causes (solar radiation changes and emissions from volcanic eruptions), and this was compared with the results from a parallel set of experiments that included only natural causes"
25250,WMO-2014-3.txt," The comparison shows that human-induced climate change substantially increased the likelihood of the record-breaking Australian summer of 2013; when human influences were included in model simulations, the probability of very hot summer temperatures across Australia, such as in 2013, increased at least fivefold"
25251,WMO-2014-3.txt, These types of extreme Australian summers become even more frequent in simulations of the future under further global warming
25252,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
The recent record Australian summer was also notable because it occurred when ENSO conditions were neutral to weak La Niña; these conditions typically produce cooler temperatures across Australia"
25253,WMO-2014-3.txt," Prior to 2013, six of the eight hottest Australian summers occurred during El Niño years, but natural ENSO variations are very unlikely to explain the record 2013 Australian heat"
25254,WMO-2014-3.txt,"
Using the same modelling approach, preliminary analysis of the Australian area-average temperature record for the calendar year 2013 indicates that human-induced causes vastly increased the odds of setting a new temperature record In the model experiments, it is virtually impossible to reach such a high temperature due to natural climate variations alone In simulations with only natural causes considered, none of the 13 000 model years analysed exceed the previous hottest year in Australia, which was observed in 2005 Conversely, in simulations for the period 2006–2020 that include both natural and human-induced causes, such records occur approximately once every 10 years
In summary, comparing climate model simulations with and without human factors shows that the record hot Australian summer of 2012/2013 was about five times as likely as a result of human-induced influence on climate and that
the record hot calendar year of 2013 would have been virtually impossible without human contributions of heat-trapping gases, illustrating that some extreme events are becoming much more likely due to climate change

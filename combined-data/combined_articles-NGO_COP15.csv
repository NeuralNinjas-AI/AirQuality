Doing the Deal in Copenhagen
Negotiating a new global deal on climate change has proved to be one of the most complex international processes in recent history. There are uncertainties over what countries are willing and able to do, the ability of cost-efficient technologies to deliver the needed emissions cut and the timing and cost of the effort required. And yet the political will to secure a strong agreement in Copenhagen is clearly in place.
At the heart of the deal is the question of how collectively we put global greenhouse gas emissions on a path that minimises the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate change. We know the technologies and policies needed to achieve this and we know the reductions that are required by 2020, the first milestone along the way. Delay is not an option, as this would require much sharper cuts in emissions in the future that would be more difficult to achieve, both politically and economically.
All major countries have now made ambitious pledges to reduce their emissions over the next decade. Although these are not yet quite good enough to secure a safe climate path, they constitute a major step in the right direction. Agreement in Copenhagen should at least ensure that the most ambitious of these pledges are translated into action, while negotiations should continue to find ways to bridge the gap between these pledges and what is ultimately needed. We cannot allow the desire for a perfect deal to delay the vital opportunity we now have to move forward.
Once a start has been made in making the necessary cuts, it is likely that they will be neither as hard nor as expensive as feared. Scaling up the low-carbon technologies we already have will bring costs down, drive further innovation and improve public acceptance of the changes needed. Therefore, to enable targets to be strengthened in the coming years, governments should put in place mechanisms that will allow ambition levels to be raised. These include:
• Setting themselves longer term targets, such as for 2025 or 2030, that will create political certainty and point out the long-term path;
• Establishing are view mechanism that will be able to recommend deeper cuts, based on the latest scientific, technological and economic knowledge, with a first review in 2015;
• AgreeingtodevelopLowCarbonGrowthPlansthathelpasyetunidentifiedemissionreductionopportunitiesto be uncovered;
• Providing financial support for a ‘fast-start’ that enables immediate emissions reduction and builds the capacity for them to be scaled up.
Financing will also have to be made available, in particular to support mitigation efforts in developing countries. Here it is important that public money is used to maximise private sector investment. Deep and broad international carbon markets will play a crucial role in directing this investment towards the best opportunities. While short-term funding cannot be a substitute for more substantial flows later on, a real commitment to a fast-start, backed by new public money, will be the catalyst needed to put the agreement into action.
A deal is there to be had: now is the time to grasp it.
introDuCtion
The negotiations to secure a new global agreement that builds on and extends the achievements of the UN Framework Climate Convention on Climate Change are now entering the home straight. These negotiations cover a wide range of issues that affect almost every sector of the economy and the political system. Despite their immense complexity, at the heart of these negotiations lies one core question: how do we put global greenhouse gas emissions on a trajectory that minimizes the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate change?
To resolve this essential but broad question there are a number of more specific questions that will need to be answered by governments in Copenhagen:
• Byhowmuchmustwereduceemissionsbelowcurrentlevelsintheshort,mediumandlong-term?
• Whatdoesthismeanintermsofefforttocutemissionsfromwhattheywouldotherwisebein2020?
• Howshouldtheresponsibilityforemissionsreductionbeallocatedbetweencountries?
• Are the commitments made to date sufficient? If not, how can we obtain the additional necessary emissions reduction? • How much additional funding is needed to finance this emission reduction and how can it be provided?
• How should responsibility for this funding be shared between countries?
• Whatmechanismsareneededtobuildconfidenceintheagreementtofacilitateandguaranteeitslongevity?
Other areas being dealt with in the negotiations – adaptation, technology development and transfer, governance, measurement, reporting and verifying, and capacity building – are of course essential pieces of the climate policy jigsaw and we address some of the key institutional and governance issues later in this paper. However, if countries are unable to reach a satisfactory consensus on the crucial questions listed above, then most of these other issues become redundant. Adaptation will then be the only option and one that may already be closed down.

the emissions reDuCtion oBJeCtive: an aChievaBle safe Climate path
Heads of government around the world have already largely accepted that a safe climate path for emissions is one that keeps the average global temperature increase to no greater than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the level above which the scientific community believes the risk of irreversible and possibly runaway climate change becomes
unacceptably high. This is equal to around 1.2°C above current levels.
To have a reasonable chance of achieving this, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be stabilized at no higher than 450 parts per million (ppm), about 60% higher than that in pre-industrial times but only 15% higher than today’s.02 This, in turn, requires cutting global emissions to around 60% below the current levels
by mid-century. To achieve this, while avoiding the need for excessively abrupt and expensive reductions further
on in the future, emissions need to peak within the next ten years and then fall by an average of around 3% a year thereafter. Delaying these cuts in emissions, would mean that emissions would peak at a later date, that the starting point for the necessary cuts would be higher, and that much sharper reductions would consequently be required, estimated by some to be as much as 8% a year.03 This is not likely to be technologically feasible, nor is it likely to be acceptable economically or politically. Without action, we are likely to be closer to 750 or 800 ppm, which would result in a 4 or even 6 degree increase in average global temperatures.
It is the cumulative effect of the total emissions released into the atmosphere over the next forty years that would lead to higher global temperatures, so we can express this global emissions objective in terms of the maximum permitted annual emissions at the end of each decade through to 2050. These figures are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 below. What is evident is that there needs to be a major downward shift in the carbon intensity of economic activity if we are to sustain economic growth at the same time as keeping global emissions on a path compatible with 2°C.

Briefing paper, 7 December 2009; Stern, N (2009) Meeting the Climate Challenge: Using Public Funds to Leverage Private Investment in Developing Countries. Unpublished paper, London.
The immediate objective for 2020 is clear. Instead of allowing unconstrained emissions to rise to close to
58Gt (billion tonnes) CO2e, some 15% above current levels, we need to find and deliver 14Gt of emissions reduction.05 This is the challenge for Copenhagen.
We also know how we can obtain the emissions cut we need over the next decade. McKinsey & Company have calculated that 19Gt of emissions reduction are available around the world at a cost of less than €60/tCO2e (tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent), with the vast majority costing less than €30/tCO2e. And nearly a third of this potential can be realized through energy efficiency improvements that pay for themselves through energy cost savings. In
fact 70% of the available reductions – roughly equal to the 2020 emissions reduction challenge – can come from investing in just three areas: improved energy efficiency, low carbon energy (principally switching sources from coal to renewables, nuclear and gas) and forestry (mostly from reduced tropical deforestation).06 The policies required to achieve these reductions are well-known and have all been successfully implemented, albeit to date at a smaller scale than necessary, in various countries around the world. The challenge may be large but it is certainly manageable.
Nevertheless, meeting the 2020 challenge will certainly require some fairly major changes to how we manage our economies. It will require additional investment and will create winners and losers as old technologies and sectors are phased out and new ones appear. It will also impact different countries in different ways. Therefore an approach to sharing the responsibility for the 14GtCO2e reduction between countries needs to be found that is both fair and efficient.
There are a number of well-accepted facts and principles that can help guide this task:
• Unless all major countries and regions participate, it will be impossible to secure the emissions reduction that is needed;
• Wheretheemissionsreductionactuallytakeplaceisimmaterial.Thereforethegeographicallocationofpolicies and technology changes need not correspond to where the cost burden is felt;
• Linked to the above, an agreement that is cost-effective, i.e.which secures the needed emissions reduction at the lowest possible cost, will be more economically and politically sustainable than one that is seen to impose unnecessarily high costs;
• Fairness demands that industrialized countries – with their predominant share of historic emissions, higher current per capita emissions levels and greater wealth and technological capacity – should act first and cover at least some of the costs incurred by developing countries making emissions reductions;
• Thefairnessprinciplealsosuggeststhatcountriesinsimilarsituationsshouldmakesimilarlevelsofcommitment;
• A collaborative approach will bring greater cost - effectiveness, speed up the deployment of new technologies and
build trust between countries that each is doing its fair share;
• Investors and business require reasonable long-term certainty in order to make investments to deploy low-carbon-
technology alternatives that may not be the short-term, least-cost option.
From the above, we can identify the basic criteria for determining how the responsibility for emissions reduction should be allocated.
Firstly, industrialized countries should undertake all the mitigation options that are available at a reasonable cost. The McKinsey analysis cited above suggests that around 5Gt worth of emissions reduction can be achieved at a marginal cost of less than €60/tCO2e, with the average cost likely to be around a quarter of this amount.
Secondly, it seems reasonable to expect all countries to commit to self-financing those measures that can achieve emissions reduction at zero net cost and/or which generate co-benefits that more than outweigh the initial investment. Many efficiency improvements and some agricultural practices fall into this category, although for some less-developed countries technology and capacity support may be needed for them to be viable. For developing countries the potential abatement that falls into this category and which should therefore form part of their own contribution comes to a total of around 3Gt of emissions reduction.
Thirdly, the lowest-cost options for finding the remaining 6GtCO2e of reductions that are needed to meet the target level of 44GtCO2e in 2020 are to be found in developing countries.07 However, since realizing these options would not be economically viable in the absence of a carbon policy, the additional cost necessary to make them as attractive as the carbon-intensive, business-as-usual (BAU) alternatives should be covered by the industrialized countries.
Within these ‘net positive cost’ opportunities, there are two groups. The first group comprises those actions for which putting a price on carbon emissions would act as sufficient incentive for them to be implemented. These principally include investments in technologies that are well-known and commercially tried and tested and for which the necessary skills and institutional conditions are in place. Examples of this include switching from coal to gas for power generation or to some renewable sources of energy and the upgrading of cement production. These abatement options can be financed cost-effectively through the international carbon market, via an expanded
Clean Development Mechanism or via a new approach for crediting reductions at the sectoral level. The volume of emissions reduction that can be achieved will depend crucially on the international price of carbon; this, in turn, will be determined by the level of ambition embodied in industrialized country targets. The more ambitious these are, the greater will be the flow of financing to developing countries, and the larger the volume of emissions reduction that can be achieved.

The second group comprises of ‘net positive cost’ opportunities actions where a carbon price stimulus will be insufficient to change investment decisions, either because cost is not the main barrier to implementation or because a transparent and liquid market cannot readily be created. Much of the abatement potential from reducing tropical deforestation falls into this category and can be best supported through direct funding.
Thus we can see that to achieve the 14GtCO2e in emissions reduction needed in 2020, a reasonable division of responsibility would be for:
• Industrialized countries to cut through domestic action;
• Developing countries to contribute through measures that come at net zero or negative cost ; and
• The remaining 6Gt to take place in developing countries but be dependent on funding by industrialized countries
through a combination of private sector investments via carbon markets and direct public funding.
Reflecting the political commitment of leaders to secure a successful agreement in Copenhagen, almost all major countries have proposed significant pledges or commitments to reducing or limiting the growth of their emissions. A selection of these is shown in Table 2 below.

The range of numbers that are given for target emission levels in 2020 reflects the fact that countries have used different approaches in expressing their pledges and established conditions for meeting their more ambitious aspirations. For example, most industrialized countries have set economy-wide, absolute emissions reduction targets, but with their deeper cuts being contingent on other countries doing the same and on a global agreement being reached in Copenhagen. Most developing countries, on the other hand, have set targets relative to BAU levels, or in terms of energy or carbon intensity, meaning that the final result in absolute terms will depend on their level of economic growth over the coming decade. Moreover, in many cases, part or all of developing countries’ commitments are conditional upon sufficient financial support being made available.
If one aggregates the lower and upper bounds of the pledges across countries,08 we can identify two scenarios:
• ‘Basic Action’ scenario: comprising only unconditional national commitments, targets and policies already enshrined in law;
• ‘Ambitious Action’ scenario: comprising of pledges that allow countries to meet their highest current levels of ambition. Subject to stipulated conditions being met.
The predicted impact of both these scenarios on global emission levels in 2020 and how these compare with the 2°C path outlined earlier are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3.
 The fact that some industrialized countries assume the use of emissions reduction from developing countries as offsets, while some developing countries propose to use carbon markets to finance their contributions, means that it is not possible simply to add up all commitments. This is reflected in the difference between the figures in Table 2 on the one hand, and those in Table 3 and Figures 2, 3 and 4 on the other.

The first conclusion that can be drawn is that in both scenarios, especially that of ‘Ambitious Action’, emissions are significantly lower in 2020 than they would otherwise have been and represent a significant collective effort. The first task for leaders in Copenhagen is therefore to lock in the commitments that make up the ‘Ambitious Action’ scenario.
Nevertheless, even this scenario is not sufficient to put the world on a 2°C pathway. If no further reductions are achieved, it is likely that the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases will exceed 550ppm and that the global temperature increase will be in the order of 3.5°C. To get on the 2°C path another 5Gt of emissions reduction will need to be found.09
The aggregate impact of current pledges and the additional effort that is needed can also be broken down between industrialized and developing countries. This is shown in Figures 3 and 4. The 2°C target pathway is broken down between the two regions on the basis proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): absolute reductions by industrialized countries of between 25% and 40% and reductions by developing countries (seen in the Figure below) of between 15% and 30%.10
As in Figure 2, in both scenarios it can be seen that countries would achieve an important reduction in emissions below their BAU levels in 2020, by 4Gt and 5Gt respectively, under the ‘Ambitious Action’ scenario getting quite close to the lower end of their target range. Nevertheless, even if both groups of countries were to reach the lower end of their target range this would not be sufficient to take emissions to a level consistent with the 2°C pathway and would fill only 2GtCO2e of the 5GtCO2e gap.

Securing the extra 5Gt of emissions reduction will be no easy task, even though assessments of the 2020 mitigation potential show that further emissions reduction is available at a reasonable cost. Following the principle of achieving emissions reduction in the most cost-effective way suggests that one area where further abatement may be possible is through increased efforts to reduce deforestation in developing countries, similar to the ambitious contributions proposed by Brazil and Indonesia. However, this would be contingent on industrialized countries providing the necessary additional public funding. There may also be more low-cost abatement opportunities in developing countries in the energy and industrial sectors, which could be financed through international carbon markets. However, for this to be effective, industrialized countries would need to adopt more ambitious targets themselves, as this would generate a greater demand for international offsets.
While governments should strive to secure the necessary extra emissions reduction, it may not be possible to deal with them all in Copenhagen. This should not be seen as failure; although it is important that the gap is bridged as quickly as possible. We have already noted that the pledges under the ‘Ambitious Action’ scenario are a major first step in the right direction. It is probable that the true cost will be much lower than originally predicted, as has been the case with other environmental policies in the past, such as clean air legislation in the United States and the Montreal Protocol. The very fact that all the world’s major economies have taken on meaningful targets and enacted policies to achieve them, makes it likely that business will begin to shy away from high carbon investments, even where this is not actually mandated, in order to avoid the risk of being left with stranded assets.
What is important is that mechanisms and tools be put in place to enable increased levels of ambition to be included as soon as possible after Copenhagen. There are three immediate ways of doing this, which complement each other:
1. Establishing a review process to determine the additional abatement that is required and available.
The science of climate change and our understanding of the technological options for reducing emissions and for building resilience to climate impacts are continually evolving. Since it is this knowledge that frames the policy decisions that are made domestically and internationally, it is essential that this is used to inform the process of reviewing and setting new targets.
Therefore, governments in Copenhagen should establish a regular review mechanism that assesses the latest evidence on the abatement that is needed, the options that have emerged for achieving this abatement and any new knowledge of the costs involved. This assessment, performed under the direction of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), would lead to recommendations that would form the basis for a new round of negotiations on the collective and individual country targets required. This process would not amount to re-opening the Copenhagen agreement. Quite the opposite, it would constitute a way of enabling ambition levels to be raised without the need for full-blown negotiations.
The IPCC is due to publish its Fifth Assessment Report in 2014. The following year, 2015, which coincides with the half-way mark between now and 2020, would therefore seem an appropriate moment for the first of those reviews. Subsequent reviews could then proceed on a five-yearly basis.
2. Setting medium and longer term targets that establish the overall level of ambition, and thereby sending a clear signal to business and investors about policy directions.
While 2020 targets provide the spur to immediate action to cut emissions, goals for 2030 and beyond, which are enshrined in both international agreements and national legislation, can play an important role in influencing decisions about investment in areas such as power plants, public infrastructure and other projects whose operations are measured in decades rather than years. Similarly they can provide an important incentive for entrepreneurs and early stage investors in clean technologies, by indicating that markets will exist for their products and services. Where one country’s 2020 targets are not considered by the majority of others to be sufficient, setting a much tighter cap for the post-2020 period could be an effective way of demonstrating that an adequate level of ambition exists.

the 21st century.
As Table 2 above shows, many countries, from both the industrialized and developing world, have already done this, setting targets for both 2030 and 2050. This could be formalized in Copenhagen by agreeing on the collective long-term goal and providing a mechanism for countries to lodge their associated commitments. Key elements coming out of Copenhagen in this connection could include:
• Reaffirming the collective commitment to keep the average global temperature increase to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. As we have seen, this sets the parameter for the overall safe emissions path over the next 40 years;
• A global goal that emissions should fall to below half their 1990 levels, or less than 20GtCO2e, by mid-century. This could be accompanied by agreement that total emissions in 2030 should not exceed 35GtCO2e12;
• A commitment by industrialized countries to cut their emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels, or down
to two tonnes per capita in 2050.13 This would create a clear signal for business in these countries, while also demonstrating to developing countries that they will have the ‘space’ to grow while cutting their carbon intensity.
3. Creating Low Carbon Growth Plans (LCGPs) that allow further abatement opportunities to be identified.
While providing the means to ensure that emissions are kept to a safe trajectory, the targets discussed above will only be achieved if they are backed by solid national and regional policies and the necessary financing. To help facilitate this, all industrialized and major emerging economies should set out Low Carbon Growth Plans (LCGPs).
For industrialized countries the LCGPs should show how they plan to meet their targets, thereby providing credibility to their commitments and offering an indication of the expected level of carbon market financing that will be made available. Developing country LCGPs should also lay out how they propose to make their pledged contributions and, in addition, show what they will do on their own, what can be achieved through carbon market financing and where direct funding and other support is needed.
If designed well, LCGPs can provide a key tool for ensuring that a coherent set of actions that is consistent with national development priorities is developed, including the allocation of public finance, attracting external private sector investment into the low-carbon transformation of the economy, building confidence domestically and internationally, and the sharing of experiences. LGCPs provide the most direct means for identifying as yet undiscovered abatement opportunities, as well as enabling the raising of levels of ambition.
LCGPs will vary from country to country, depending on national circumstances and priorities. In those countries where the capacity to generate economy-wide plans does not yet exist, a set of proposed Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) could be proposed, covering those sectors where policies can be put in place and that are in need of support. Where possible, these should aim to use the same metrics to facilitate monitoring, comparison of progress and assessment of investment opportunities.
 The additional costs refer to the extra financing required to make the rate of return on low-carbon and climate-resilient investments at least equal to the least cost or most profitable option for providing the same service.
 An agreement that successfully puts the world on, or close to, the 2°C path and that drives a rapid transition to a climate resilient, low-carbon global economy will require a major mobilisation and redirection of both public and private capital. In particular, as stated above, new financing will be needed:
• To finance the additional investment costs associated with mitigation strategies in developing countries14 and make capital loans available for abatement options that generate positive returns but for which capital availability is a limiting factor;
• TosupportReducingEmissionsfromDeforestationandForestDegradationandothernaturalsinksindeveloping countries (i.e. REDD+, which we discuss later on).
In addition to that, new financing will be needed:
• To increase publicly supported Research, Development and Diffusion (RD&D) of new technologies for both mitigation and adaptation;
• To build institutional and technical capacity in developing countries, including: for the design of Low Carbon Growth Plans; monitoring, reporting and verification; needs assessment; and programme development;
• Tocoverthecostsofadaptation,particularlyinpoorer,morevulnerablecountries.
In order to drive long-term planning and investment decisions effectively, the funding in each of these areas will need to be genuinely new, additional and predictable.
volume anD sourCe of funDs
Estimates of the total quantum of financing required depend on critical assumptions about future energy prices, rates of economic growth, the cost of different abatement options, the response of the climate to increased warming and associated impacts and the speed and effectiveness of the global policy response. Nevertheless, most studies put the annual amount needed to cover the incremental costs of adaptation and mitigation in developing countries at between US$100 billion and US$200 billion by 2020, with approximately two-thirds for mitigation and the remainder for adaptation, technology and capacity building.15
Whichever numbers are used, this represents a significant increase on the current annual flows of US$9 billion for mitigation in developing countries, of which three quarters flow through the CDM, while approximately US$600 million is allocated to the Climate Investment Funds and around US$200 million is committed to adaptation through the Global Environment Facility.16 A deal in Copenhagen should therefore have at its heart a commitment to generate financing of at least US$100 billion a year by 2020. It is important that countries are committed to the right scale of finance from the outset – while small amounts of money can effect important changes, without a transformational approach, we will only be incurring higher costs for the future. Of this total, some US$10 billion needs to be deployed immediately as part of a fast-start provision in the agreement (see below).17

By no means all of this money needs to be raised from public finances, although public money will be the predominant source of funding for adaptation, technology development, capacity building and REDD+. If deployed effectively, public funds can be used to leverage significant investment from the private sector. It is worth bearing in mind that the more ambitious the emissions cap that is adopted by industrialized countries, the greater the (private sector) investments that will flow through the carbon markets and the less that will be required from public purses. Several sources of public funding have been suggested in the academic literature and through the UN negotiations.18
• US$10-15billioncouldberaisedthroughtheauctioningofemissionallowancestotheaviationandshippingsectors as part of a market-based sectoral agreement;
• Asimilaramountcouldbegeneratedbyauctioningaportionoftheemissionspermitsthatmakeupthe industrialized country cap and/or the allowances allocated to companies under national and regional emissions trading schemes;
• A levy on international emissions trading, similar to the 2% levy that currently applies to Clean Development Mechanism projects, with the total dependent on the size of the global carbon market;
• Use of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and other international financial instruments;
• Direct government support, through additional Overseas Development Assistance( ODA) and other forms of
public finance (of up to US$30 billion, including voluntary contributions from both industrialized and developing countries) and concessional debt (of US$6-10 billion), with contribution levels set using a metric like that contained in the Mexican Green Fund proposal; and
• Use of public balance sheets to leverage private investment, for example by providing risk  guarantees.
It is likely that a combination of all of the above will be needed and governments in Copenhagen should agree to both the overall level to be reached by 2020 and to targets for funding from bunker fuel allowances, and assigned amount auctions. As well as agreement on this overall target, individual countries should commit firm amounts of public funding in the immediate, short-term and should have these commitments recorded, monitored and verified as part of their broader obligations. Initially, this direct public funding will need to be the primary source to ensure a predictable flow of funds until the other mechanisms can take over; as other sources expand so the need for additional public support will be reduced.
Alongside the public funding, it is essential that private sector, low-carbon financing is mobilised. Indeed, as emissions reduction targets become more ambitious, the price of carbon (and fossil-based energy) rises, supporting policies (such as efficiency and renewable energy standards) are increasingly put in place and the capacity to develop investible emissions reduction projects and programmes improves, so it is reasonable to assume that more mitigation financing will come from the private sector.
The main source of private sector financing for emissions reduction in the developing world is likely to be the carbon market. An expanded CDM would allow investment both individual projects and programmatic approaches and have greater capacity for processing projects quickly and involving more countries. This could be complemented by new crediting systems that enable the transformation of whole sectors to be financed based on pre-established low-carbon plans. With sufficiently tight caps in industrialized countries, these carbon market mechanisms can drive large quantities of investment – possibly as much as US$50-100 billion per year by 2020 – into cost-effective greenhouse gas abatement. This is about half the additional annual investment that the International Energy Agency (IEA) says will be needed in developing countries by 2030 for low-carbon restructuring of their energy production and consumption.19
Crucially, however, carbon markets are not and cannot be the only mechanisms used to mobilise low-carbon
private finance and need to be complemented and supported by other approaches. For example, energy efficiency improvement programmes are likely to be financed more successfully through the creation of low cost debt facilities that help to cover the sometimes high, initial investment costs that are then recouped through energy bills and other methods for capturing reduced energy costs. REDD programmes are also unlikely to be best served by carbon markets in the short-term, while blended public and private finance in consolidated funds that are linked to both policies and concrete outcomes could prove very effective.
Given the importance of REDD, it is essential that early action is taken in this area. Forestry and agriculture account for more than 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and, as we have seen, provide as much as 50% of the cost-effective emissions abatement opportunities in 2020. Tropical deforestation is the largest source of land-based emissions and thus provides the most urgent and immediate opportunity for action. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, along with enhancement, conservation, and sustainable management of forests (collectively referred to as ‘REDD+’) has emerged as one of the strongest areas of consensus for multilateral agreement and action in Copenhagen. An immediate investment of €15-25 billion could reduce global deforestation rates by 25% in 2015 with a corresponding reduction in emissions of 7GtCO e.20

In the short-term at least, however, the carbon market will not be sufficient to finance the necessary scale of reductions. Specific fund structures will be needed to:
• Support the creation of the necessary technical and institutional infrastructure; • Support (smaller) governments in developing alternative development plans;
• Fund projects and programmes that reduce deforestation; and
• Finance deforestation policies at the national/ regional level.21
Catalysing a fast-start
In addition to the components above, countries should agree a fast-start mechanism, comprising initial funding and technical support to build capacity in developing countries, that will enable action to start immediately without waiting for 2013 (the likely starting point for formal commitments) or for the completion of all the legal work that remains to be finalised after Copenhagen. This fast-start funding would be used for the following:
• Help rain forest nations build capacity for REDD and deliver initial reductions in deforestation;
• Build the infrastructure necessary to expand the international carbon market;
• Support the development of Low Carbon Growth Plans and NAMAs;
• Create and strengthen institutional capacity in developing countries for: project delivery; monitoring,reporting
and verification of emissions reductions; technology development and diffusion; and adaptation planning;
• Implementation of short-term preventative adaptation measures;
• Accelerate the development and diffusion of next generation technology solutions.22
As noted above, these fast-start activities will require at least US$10 billion in funding to be made available as soon as possible. This money should be put on the table in Copenhagen and placed into an international fund (or, if not, set aside and earmarked as being from national budgets and registered as such with the UNFCCC) by industrialized countries from public budgets, over and above their existing ODA commitments, and be independent of final agreement on the legal treaty that will be constructed on the Copenhagen agreement. Beyond enabling the critical actions outlined above, the provision of these funds would represent a significant gesture of commitment towards, and help to build confidence in, the delivery of the Copenhagen agreement.
governing the finanCes
A well-designed and managed governance system that provides transparency, guarantees that funds are directed where they are most needed and is flexible enough to respond to a wide range of needs in countries at differing stages of development is the third key ingredient for a successful climate framework. Although there are disagreements about the transparency, representativeness and effectiveness of existing institutions, these should nevertheless be used wherever possible to avoid long delays in putting the architecture in place, while still dealing directly with the issues that have been raised.
Foremost amongst these issues is ensuring greater ownership of the funds by developing countries, in particular through a more balanced representation on their boards and management structures. Moreover, the funds
– especially those relying heavily on public money – should be accountable to the UNFCCC, again to ensure representative decision-making, broad geographical use of funding and to ensure that disbursement does not respond excessively to the priorities of ‘donors’. Equally important is ensuring that the respective institutions have the capacity to deal with large-scale financing – at levels far larger than existing flows of climate finance – using programmatic and strategic approaches rather than purely project-based ones, and without high levels of procedural complexity and slow decision-making.

The creation of a registry system for aggregating, measuring, reviewing and strengthening national commitments, together with agreeing institutions for inspecting and auditing emission inventories and performance reports on commitments, represent the foundations of the new agreement and will be necessary to facilitate the meeting of commitments made on emissions reductions and on finance discussed above.
These foundations will facilitate comparisons between countries’ commitments and their performance in meeting them, enable assistance to be provided in a timely manner to those having difficulty meeting their obligations, help channel necessary financial and technological support, and strengthen the expansion of international emissions trading. In the case of emissions trading, consistency on how emissions and emission reduction credits are assessed and measured is essential to promoting trust in the units being traded, ensuring full convertibility between units from different sectors and regions and thereby allowing the market to seek out and channel financing to the least cost abatement options efficiently.
There are five critical areas needing agreement:
1. Comprehensive and transparent reporting and the review of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a timely manner.
A significant amount of work was done in developing the Marrakech Accords to establish a rigorous scientifically- based system for estimating, reporting and reviewing GHG emissions from developed country Parties under an international system.23 These efforts were embodied in a series of decisions taken by governments and subsequently implemented by all developed countries. The vast majority of the provisions agreed are applicable to whatever kind of agreement is reached in Copenhagen and should serve as the core elements for reporting and reviewing GHG emissions under this new international agreement.
2. A transparent mechanism for registering countries’ commitments and actions.
The ability of countries to have confidence in the commitments and contributions of their peers is essential for building trust in the international climate policy regime. This is one of the reasons for asking all countries to prepare Low Carbon Growth Plans that detail how they will meet their commitments and that can be used as a metric for monitoring progress over time. However, it is not only LCGPs that need to be open to scrutiny, an international registry system that allows LCGPs, emissions reduction and commitments to provide climate finance to be lodged, reported, monitored and assessed and verified would enable independent assessment of the comparability of different commitments and of progress towards meeting them. This registry should be operated by the UNFCCC and supported by a cross-country panel of experts to provide independent analysis and review. Information contained in the registry would be publicly available, thereby also facilitating exchange of best practice on policies, measures and other successful approaches to addressing both mitigation and adaptation.
3. Common standards for reporting and reviewing GHG emissions resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry.
Methods for estimating emissions and emission reductions from land use, land-use change and forestry aim to allow Parties to compare the level of effort among countries, to promote linking of emission trading systems and to ensure that land use, land-use change and forestry credits that are purchased from another Party comply with national laws. Common standards would ensure that national baselines are set consistently with each other; that the same definitions are used to assess forest cover, deforestation and activities designed to maintain or increase forest cover; and that the same methodologies are used to account for natural disturbances such as fires or pestilence. Countries have already adopted rules for estimating land-use change emission inventories based on IPCC Guidelines and IPCC Good Practice Guidance and for reporting them using a common reporting format. Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries have also adopted criteria and guidelines for defining, estimating and accounting for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, along with the accounting rules for forest management, cropland management, grazing land management, and revegetation. Given the work that developing these rules has involved and the high degree of consensus around them, it makes obvious sense for countries to use them as the basis for the new agreement.

4. Common standards for national GHG registries and the transfer of units between entities in different countries.
National GHG registries are the basic infrastructure necessary for properly functioning carbon markets. By holding emissions units held by entities operating in their jurisdictions and by ensuring the emissions trades between these entities are accurately recorded and, via an International Transactions Log (ITL), consistent with pre-established rules, they underpin the integrity of emissions trading. The ITL also provides an independent check that unit holdings are being recorded accurately in registries.
It should be self-evident that internationally agreed standards for registries are essential to prevent double counting as well as possibly fraudulent transactions between entities, for facilitating access to the international offset market, for tracking the purchase of offsets by entities and countries, and for determining compliance with national laws. This should therefore be a central part of the framework agreed in Copenhagen.
5. Common standards for global carbon markets.
In order to operate effectively and efficiently, carbon markets need to have high levels of transparency, stability
and, where more than one market is linked together, common operating rules and principles. In establishing the current global carbon market, a wide range of internationally agreed methodologies and guidelines have already been developed that govern the trading and issuance in the global carbon market of carbon permits and credits and include rules for emissions reporting, basic conditions for participating in carbon markets (such as having well- managed inventories that meet global standards) and rules to allow and govern the consistency of offsets, so that one tonne of emissions reduction is the same and verified to the same standard in all countries. Maintaining these standards, and building on them where necessary through the international process rather than relying on an ad hoc process of national standards, will ensure transparent comparability of efforts and smooth the development of an efficient, global carbon market.

gloBal emissions reDuCtions – options to 2020
To put ourselves on an pathway that will give us a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 2°C above pre-industrial levels, we need to reduce global annual emissions by 14GtCO2e below Business-As-Usual (BAU) levels in 2020. Analysis by the IPCC, the IEA and McKinsey & Company suggests that some 19GtCO2e of abatement options are available at a reasonable cost a less than €60/tCO2e. Many of the options, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, destruction of industrial gases and reducing deforestation can be realised at a significantly lower cost or even no net cost at all.
The opportunities can be divided into three categories (see Figure A):
1. Energy efficiency and other process improvements 2. Low carbon energy supply
3. Terrestrial carbon

energy effiCienCy anD other proCess improvements
One third of the available low cost abatement opportunities available over the next ten years can be achieved through improvements in energy efficiency, changes in industrial processes and capture of fugitive gases. The main options include (see figure B):
• the use of efficient electrical appliances, lighting ,and air conditioning systems; • substitution of inefficient industrial motors;
• building insulation;
• efficient cars and trucks and hybrid vehicles;
• reduced leaks from gas pipelines;
• capture and destruction of industrial gases; and • improved steel and cement manufacture.

One fifth of the abatement potential by 2020 can be achieved by shifting from high to low carbon energy resources. Of these wind power and already planned nuclear make up nearly half of the total opportunity while solar (both photovoltaic and concentrating solar thermal) and biomass can also make an important contribution (see Figure C).

Nearly half the global emission reductions available by 2020 can be delivered through reduced emissions from deforestation, forest degradation and land use change – see Figures A and D. By far the biggest single portion of this can be achieved by reducing tropical deforestation with other options including reforestation of pastures, grasslands and degraded forests, low till agriculture, efficient cropland management, soil restoration and biochar.

reDuCing emissions from Deforestation anD DegraDation (reDD)
The Kyoto Protocol excludes payment for action to reduce carbon emissions from forest destruction and degradation, but ‘REDD’ is one of the more probable areas for agreement at COP 15.
Without an effective global deal for REDD, cutting global emissions to stabilise at 450ppm will be much more difficult and expensive, if not impossible, to achieve. ‘REDD+’ which includes measures to reduce peat emissions offers significant additional abatement potential.
REDD abatement potential
The greatest potential for forest carbon abatement lies in reducing forest destruction and degradation in developing countries. Very large volumes of carbon are stored in forests and forest soils in the northern hemisphere, particularly in the vast boreal forests. However, over 90% of global deforestation and associated GHG emissions (c. 13 million hectares and 5 – 7GtCO2e, every year) is estimated to occur in tropical countries, with Indonesia and Brazil, the largest forest carbon emitters.
McKinsey’s global abatement cost curve indicates that forestry related actions in developing countries have the potential to deliver up to 6GtCO2e of abatement by 2020. An additional 1GtCO2e potential exists from reduced peat emissions.
The importance of REDD’s abatement potential lies not only in its volume, but also in the possibility for relatively rapid progress over the coming decade. REDD will require a planning and start up phase, but relative to the scale-up time that some key low-carbon technology solutions will need, REDD could deliver significant abatement quickly.
The Informal Working Group on Interim Finance for REDD+ estimates that by 2015 deforestation rates and emissions could be cut by 25%, and that – with similar rates of reduction in peat emissions – a cumulative saving of 7GtCO2e could be achieved by 2015. This assumes that preparatory action gets underway early in 2010, and that funding of €15-25 billion is made available over the 2010-15 period.
Requirements of an effective international REDD agreement
A number of unilateral and bilateral commitments have already been made to reduce forest emissions. Notably, Brazil and Guyana have both developed national strategies to limit their emissions, based primarily on measures to conserve their forests.
Norway has reached significant funding agreements with both countries. In Brazil’s case payments will be dependent on achieving a sustained downward trend in deforestation against historically high rates of destruction. In the
case of Guyana, which has had minimal deforestation, payments will be conditional on developing and following a low-carbon development pathway which leaves its forests intact.
BreaKing the Climate DeaDloCK Doing the Deal: KEY ELEMENTS FOR A COPENHAGEN CLIMATE AGREEMENT 24
Individual initiatives such as these are important in their own right, but for REDD to reach its full abatement potential, a common international REDD framework is required. That framework will need to unlock adequate funding on the one hand, and the required levels of commitment and ability to protect forests on the other. An agreement that creates such a framework will need to provide for:
• Funding available to forested developing countries that is sufficient, sustainable and predictable enough to incentivise serious, sustained commitment to REDD action by developing. Funds are needed to:
- build capacity and develop adequate strategies;
- begin to implement those strategies; and
- pay developing countries for verified forest emissions reductions.
The funding requirement is estimated variously at between US$15 and 40 billion per annum, with in the order of 90% used for payments for verified forest emissions reductions.
• Afundingarrangementthatissufficientlyflexibletoincentivisedevelopingcountrieswithhistoricallyhigh deforestation rates to cut their emissions, and to incentivise those with historically low deforestation not to start deforesting.
• REDD results-based payments made on the basis of reliable transparent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions against agreed baselines, such that confidence in the system is maintained.
• Proper provisions and safeguards for the rights and interests of indigenous people and other local communities.
• Safe guards against perverse carbon outcomes, including protecting peat soils. Key negotiating challenges
The main challenges facing negotiators include:
• Funding commitments;
• REDD commitments by developing countries (national commitments, and commitments conditional on external funding);
• The extent to which developed economies should be allowed to offset their emissions through ‘REDD’;
• How finance, and particularly payments for emissions should be raised– whether through market mechanisms or
an international fund, or both;
• Whether existing international institutions/ organisations should be responsible for the management and
international distribution of funds, or if a new institution is required;
• Monitoring Report and Verification requirements;
• How biodiversity conservation should be addressed within the framework;
• How the rights and interests of indigenous people and local communities should be addressed within the framework;
• How to avoid perverse carbon outcomes, and particularly avoid peat emissions,
Progress has been made in many of these areas, under the Bali Road Map process, through initiatives taken by individual countries and through bilateral agreements to developed real-world REDD projects.
Divisions between developing countries appear to have reduced somewhat in the months leading up to COP 15. Brazil’s call for an international fund is still distinct from the Coalition of Rainforest Nation’s preference for funding through carbon markets, but there appears to be a growing consensus that some combination of government and market mechanisms will be necessary.
There also appears to be broad agreement around the actions that should qualify for REDD funding. The three-stage phased funding approach deployed by Norway, which provides support for readiness action and for payment for verified emissions reductions, helps to accommodate the differing states of ‘readiness’ among developing states. Support for a ‘REDD+’ approach that protects and enhances forests and protects peatland has also strengthened.
While there seems to be stronger agreement among developing countries at the conceptual level as to how
REDD should be framed, it remains to be seen how well this increased unity will hold during detailed negotiations.

A CLIMATE GROUP ASSESSMENT
JANUARY 2010
Introduction
The 15th UN Climate Conference concluded late last month with the ambiguous adoption, or ‘noting’, of a ‘Copenhagen Accord’. This political document was delivered at the end of two weeks of tense and often confusing negotiations. Its exact legal status – and hence its implications - remain the subject of debate and it leaves unanswered many of the difficult questions that have bedeviled climate negotiations for much of the past two years.
Despite this, the Copenhagen Accord represents an important milestone in international efforts to address climate change. For the first time, the US, China and all other major economies have committed to take concrete and verifiable action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; new money has been put on the table; and a long-term objective – keeping the average global temperature increase to below 2° above pre-industrial levels – has been adopted.
While many details are still to be determined, the Accord contains the seeds for a new, country-driven, ‘bottom-up’ approach to tackling climate change that could potentially offer an effective route to accelerated global emission reductions. The risks, however, are considerable. In the absence of any internationally agreed medium- and long-term emission targets, backed by a legally-binding agreement, much will depend on whether governments embrace a ‘race to the top’ mentality or succumb to lowest common denominator climate policies. The next 12-24 months will be critical in determining which path countries choose.
***
The remainder of this paper is divided into the following four short sections:
• A summary of the key events during the two week summit
• A brief overview of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord
• Our assessment of the Accord
• Our assessment of the impacts and implications for the US, China, the EU and India.
1
Summary of the Copenhagen Conference
Officials arrived in Copenhagen with over 200 pages of draft treaty text covering negotiations under both the Kyoto Protocol and the overarching UN Climate Convention. Their objective was to reduce this stack of papers to a manageable size in order to present climate ministers, and subsequently heads of government, with a limited set of options for final negotiation and adoption.
The hope and expectation was that countries would agree new binding emission cuts for developed countries, either under the Kyoto Protocol or a new agreement, as well as strengthen the Climate Convention by committing developing countries to nationally appropriate mitigation action. Parties were also seeking to reach agreement on issues of adaptation, reducing deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), technology development and transfer, and financing to support climate actions in developing countries.
While negotiators made considerable progress in the first week in significantly reducing the length of the draft texts, they were unable to resolve core deadlock issues. A critical disagreement was over the ‘legal form’ of a Copenhagen outcome. Developed countries’ call for a single new agreement that combined the outcomes from the Kyoto and Convention track negotiations was strongly opposed by developing countries, who stated that they would not allow ‘Kyoto to be killed’. This, in particular, reflected their concern that the core principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities - under which wealthy nations are required to act first - would be undermined or abandoned.
Ministers therefore arrived for the second week to find considerable gaps still existing between parties. Closed-door ministerial discussions made some progress early in the week but failed to provide a break through. In an effort to make progress, the Danish host and president of the Conference attempted to introduce a ‘President’s text’ in order to ensure that an outcome of some kind was ready for the 120 heads of state to adopt on the final day. Unfortunately, this was seen by many developing countries as a way to circumvent the party-driven process of the negotiations and led to more delay and distrust.
With the arrival of heads of state and little more than 24 hours left of the conference, a select, but representative group of approximately 26 countries met to hammer out a deal. Behind closed doors presidents, prime ministers and their senior advisors worked throughout the final day.
Late in the evening President Obama announced that a deal had been done with China, India, Brazil and South Africa (the so-called ‘BASIC’ group) on a ‘Copenhagen Accord’. Endorsement (often reluctant) from other countries, including the EU, followed. Consensus, however, was not achieved, with a small but vocal group of countries unwilling to accept the outcome.
2
Wrangling about the status of the Accord continued in the final plenary session through Friday night and into Saturday morning, with anger, weariness and even despair characterizing the exchanges between Parties. Eventually, a combination of minor amendments and a change to chair ensured that a conclusion was reached. The final result, however – a formal UNFCCC decision that “takes note of the Copenhagen Accord” – leaves a certain level of ambiguity about the legal status of the agreement. This may create difficulties when discussions on implementing the Accord begin.
Although a deal was ultimately done, there is widespread recognition that the Copenhagen Accord is neither a perfect nor a final deal – a fact acknowledged by President Obama and other leaders. Indeed, given the lack of detail and the range of crucial elements missing from the Accord, 2010 will be busy and critical year for international climate negotiations if the world is to realistically achieve the kind of emission reductions demanded by the climate science.

What is in the Copenhagen Accord?
The Copenhagen Accord is a short, simple document of just over two pages (see www.unfccc.int for a copy). Its structure and content mirror the ‘Bali Action Plan’, which has guided the Climate Convention (UNFCCC) negotiations over the past two years.
The key points of the Accord are as follows:
• On the politics: acknowledgement of the seriousness of the problem and need for urgent, collective action in line with existing principles (e.g. CBDR1)
• On the science: endorsement of the IPCC’s recommendation that global temperature increase be kept below 2oC.
• On adaptation: agreement that developed countries will provide adequate and predictable financial, technical and capacity-building support to developing countries.
• On developed country mitigation: agreement that Annex I parties will commit to quantified economy- wide emission reductions by 2020 (although with no individual or aggregate targets given), with targets submitted to the UNFCCC by 31 January 2010. These targets, as well as financing to support developing country climate action, are to be monitored, reported and verified.
• On developing country mitigation: agreement that non-Annex I parties will implement mitigation actions that are monitored, reported and verified. These actions are to be submitted to the UNFCCC by 31 January 2010. Action by the poorest and most vulnerable countries is voluntary.
• On Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV): agreement that unilateral developing country mitigation action will be subject to domestic MRV’ing with “international consultation and analysis” that respects “national sovereignty”; agreement that mitigation action supported by developed countries will be subject to international MRV’ing. Both developed and developing country MRV’ing will be subject to existing and to-be-agreed UNFCCC guidelines.
• On finance levels: commitment by developed countries to provide US$30 billion in short-term financing between 2010 and 2012 and to mobilize US$100 billion per annum by 2020. This will be from public, private, multilateral and alternative sources. Funding will be used for mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer and capacity-building in developing countries.
• On financial architecture: agreement to establish a ‘Copenhagen Green Climate Fund’ which will receive a significant proportion of the above finance flows. Also the establishment of a ‘High Level Panel’ to study the contribution of potential sources of revenue.
• On ‘REDD plus’: agreement that a mechanism to mobilize funds to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and support conservation is needed.
• On technology: agreement to establish a ‘technology mechanism’ to accelerate the transfer and development of mitigation and adaptation technologies.
1 UNFCCC short-hand for ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’.

• On markets: acknowledgement that markets enhance the cost-effectiveness of and promote mitigation actions. Implicit reference to benefits of emissions crediting or trading mechanisms to support low-carbon development in developing countries.
• On review of the Accord: a “call” to assess implementation of the Accord by 2015, with consideration of a 1.5oC temperature target.

Our assessment of the Accord
As noted above the Copenhagen Accord is neither a perfect nor a final global climate deal. It certainly falls short of the kind of comprehensive, ambitious and legally-binding agreement that was envisaged when countries adopted the Bali Road Map in December 2007. The Accord is not without merit, however. There are both good and not-so-good (or missing) aspects to it.
The good bits
• Having the US, China, India and other major developing countries sign up to a joint climate agreement for the first time.
• All of these countries also making unconditional national pledges to either cut or slow the growth of their emissions and/or implement specific measures to achieve this.
• Securing agreement on limiting average global temperature increase to 2oC or less.
• Resolution of the monitoring, reporting and verification issue relating to developing country mitigation
action (a previous deadlock issue).
• Developed countries’ commitment to provide US$30 billion of short-term funding through to 2012, and
US$100 billion per annum of long-term funding by 2020, close to the level many had been demanding.
The not-so-good (or missing) bits
• Lack of a long-term global emission reduction goal (e.g. 50% reduction of emissions by 2050).
• Lack of both individual and aggregate absolute emission targets for developed countries for 2020.
• Lack of relative emission reduction targets for developing countries for 2020 (i.e. deviation from BAU
trajectories).
• Absence of any reference to a global emissions peaking date, or even a developed country peaking
date, meaning that, together with the above, no clear pathway for emissions has been agreed.
• No mention of a timetable for concluding a legally binding agreement.
• Little or no reference to the need for, and role of, expanded carbon markets and no clarity over the
future of the CDM and other market-based instruments.
• The uncertainty created over the future of the UNFCCC process, and particularly the Kyoto Protocol.
• Lack of any obvious mechanism for regularly ratcheting up levels of ambition (apart from the 2015
review).
Our overall assessment is that Accord represents an important political step, which, if implemented with ambition and in a spirit of cooperation, has the potential to unlock real and significant action at both national and international levels. However, this is conditional on immediate, concrete and ongoing commitment from all major economies beginning in early 2010.
6
Countries need to demonstrate that they are in a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. Filling in the gaps noted above would be a good starting point. The first critical signal will be the commitments and actions that countries are required to submit to the UNFCCC by January 31st. Other key events to look for include the successful passage of effective energy and climate legislation in the US during the first half of 2010, and early confirmation of the sources and precise levels of ‘fast-track’ financing from developed countries.
At present, the pledges made by Annex I parties and the large developing countries fall short of the emission cuts recommended by climate scientists and, as a consequence, the pathway to the 2° target explicitly referenced in the Copenhagen Accord. A five billion ton emission shortfall in 2020 (comparable to the EU’s total current annual emissions) is likely even if all the major emitters commit to their most ambitious current pledges. International discussions over the coming year will need to focus on how to bridge this gap. The agreement in Copenhagen to extend the mandates of both the Convention and Protocol negotiating groups for another year provides the fora for these discussions to take place. Countries may also look to the G20 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) to make additional progress.
What does this all mean for business?
The Accord’s implications for business are also somewhat ambiguous. On the positive side, all major countries have committed to introduce and/or strengthen their national climate plans and legislation, which is the key driver for business investment. However, the lack of detail and missing elements in the Accord are unlikely to provide the long-term certainty that many businesses had been seeking from Copenhagen. The shift away from a top-down Kyoto-style approach to a more bottom-up ‘pledge and review’ structure also raises questions about the expansion of an international carbon market and indeed the Kyoto Protocol itself.
Although the Accord explicitly mentions emission targets for Annex I Parties under Kyoto, there is no guarantee that countries such as Canada, Japan or Australia will sign up to a second commitment period – especially as they can now join the US in making bottom-up pledges under the Accord. The EU has also stated that there is no point in having one set of rules for one group of developed countries and another set of rules for another group.
If the Accord does herald the end to the Kyoto Protocol (which developing countries unequivocally believe it does not) then this raises additional questions about the future of both the CDM and Joint Implementation mechanisms. The Accord only makes passing reference to market mechanisms, although developed countries are clearly interested in using them. If a second Protocol commitment period does not eventuate as a consequence of the new direction taken by the Accord, then a means to maintain both the CDM and JI mechanism will need to be found under another framework.
Clearly then, the adoption of the Accord throws up a number of uncertainties concerning the flexibility mechanisms that have been the main success stories of the Kyoto Protocol. Countries will need to
7
address these uncertainties as quickly as possible in order to provide certainty to existing carbon markets.
However, the shift to a national-led, bottom-up approach could also be to the benefit of business. If the Accord catalyzes greater immediate domestic action – because countries are no longer waiting for an international agreement to be finalized – then markets for low-carbon goods and services are likely to grow sooner and faster than would otherwise be the case.
What does this all mean for the UNFCCC process?
As one commentator noted, the US-led Accord has “changed the geometry of the international climate architecture”.
The difficulty of reaching agreement over the two weeks of the conference, despite the various solutions that were on the table, demonstrated the inadequacies of the UN process. The fact that the Accord was ultimately brokered by the US, China, India, Brazil and South Africa also raised questions about the EU’s ability to lead and influence major international negotiations. However, the EU is unlikely to be alone in analyzing the implications of the geopolitical shift evident in Copenhagen.
The major players may now look to the G20 and Major Economies Forum as the vehicles for delivering the objectives of the Accord. While these fora would exclude the vast majority of the world’s countries, they would also avoid the procedural difficulties associated with the UNFCCC while still covering the vast majority of the world’s emissions. If a way could be found to ensure the interests of smaller countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, were still addressed, then this pluri lateral  approach could well prove to be more effective in addressing climate change.
This would not be a straightforward shift to make, however. There is considerable resistance, in particular from smaller countries, to abandoning a system that establishes representative governance systems and, which guarantees an equal right to speak and to support or block a given outcome. Poorly designed parallel processes that are seen to undermine rather than complement or facilitate more inclusive systems may in themselves become an obstacle to effective global action. Countries must be careful that this does not happen.

Impact and Implications for Key Countries THE UNITED STATES
Generally, the Copenhagen Accord should have a positive impact on the domestic US process. President Obama demonstrated to his home audience that he was not prepared to give away US economic interests and secured an agreement that included action by all major emerging economies. Many Senators believe that without agreement on emission reduction targets, financing and monitoring at the international level, domestic action to address climate change would be in vain. For the first time, the Copenhagen Accord reached a partial consensus on all three of these issues - which should increase Senators’ confidence that if they pass climate legislation, a truly global effort will to follow.
The emission reduction targets proposed by the US in Copenhagen are completely in line with what is being debated in the US Congress. However, President Obama’s commitment to contribute to the US$100 billion needed by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries is unprecedented, and will no doubt spark a heated debate in Congress, which must approve any international funding. By committing to a figure that is in line with what is needed, Obama made sure that this debate will start from the right point - challenging Representatives and Senators to re-evaluate their concept of what financing is needed to address this issue on a global scale.
In the meantime, for the US to make good on its commitment to contribute to a US$30 billion Fast Start Fund, President Obama will need to get Congress to approve the US$1.2 billion for this purpose in his 2010 budget, and then get a figure closer to US$3 billion approved for 2011.
For US businesses, while details on things like CDM reform and a new crediting program for REDD did not emerge from Copenhagen, the Accord - combined with the finalization of the EPA’s “endangerment finding” - provides more certainty that a price on carbon in the US is forthcoming. Copenhagen showed that the US is committed to a global deal and to providing financing to ensure that all parties are a part of that deal.
That said, there is still a long road ahead. And once again, the US Senate holds the balance of power in America's response. Ambitious legislation that enshrines the targets put forward by the White House for 2020 and the deeper cuts contained in current proposals for 2030 will send a clear signal – domestically and internationally – that the US is truly taking on a leadership role and will cement the progress made in Copenhagen. Together with specific measures to support energy conservation and clean technology, this legislation would unleash the innovative power of US businesses and generate as yet unseen scale to international carbon and clean energy markets. Failure to pass such legislation, though, risks creating a global policy stalemate that may be difficult for the world to resolve.

CHINA
China is likely to be content with the outcome from COP15, but also disappointed with the lack of detailed progress made across the wider negotiating process. Although criticized by some developed countries for undermining the level of ambition in the Copenhagen Accord – a charge it has strongly rebutted – China has unquestionably established itself as an equal to the US in shaping the post-2012 global climate architecture.
Unlike many other developing countries, China’s criterion for success at Copenhagen was based more on maintaining its own core positions than extracting concessions from other Parties. In this regard it largely achieved its objectives.
Before Copenhagen, China faced considerable pressure from developed countries to pledge deeper emissions cuts compared to business-as-usual. However, in the absence of wider ambition (particularly from the majority of developed countries themselves) China’s pre-conference commitment to a 40-45% carbon intensity target was not seriously challenged or critiqued and, depending on the evolution of the Chinese economy, may turn out to be a very challenging goal.
Other ‘successes’ for China from Copenhagen include the agreement to continue the two-track negotiation process, and the defense of its core position on the sensitive issue of ‘MRV’ (i.e. ensuring differentiation in MRV’ing for unilateral versus supported mitigation action). The ambiguity of the MRV text, however, leaves room for further disagreement with the US and other developed countries as discussions continue in 2010.
On the sensitive subject of financing, China is likely to be satisfied with the commitment by developed countries to provide both short and long-term funding. Alternative proposals had called for contributions from all countries (LDCs3 excluded). China has indicated a willingness to contribute some level of international financial but, importantly for China, this will be on its own terms and on a voluntary basis.
Perhaps the most influential outcome in the long term, however, will be the emergence of the ‘BASIC‘ group of countries and China’s de facto leadership of it. Copenhagen effectively marked the end of the ‘G774+China’ negotiating group within international climate negotiations, a fact underlined by the BASIC group’s role in drafting the Copenhagen Accord. China’s invitation to other BASIC members to meet in late January to coordinate positions is a clear indication of how it wishes to see the international climate architecture evolve.
The Chinese government’s position for 2010 climate talks, however, is still to look for a meaningful and constructive global agreement that is based on the two-track negotiating process, basic principles of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, as well as the Bali Action Plan.

An early indication of Chinese intentions and ambitions for 2010 will be the January 31st deadline for submissions on national mitigation actions under the Copenhagen Accord. Based on the Premier Wen’s speech in Copenhagen, China’s commitments are likely to include its 40-45% carbon intensity reduction pledge for 2020 (over 2005 levels); its 15% primary energy supply target from nuclear and renewable energy sources; and a target to increase its forest cover. Commitment to reduce energy intensity, building on the 20% improvement target in China’s current 11th Five Year Plan, is also likely to feature.
China has implied that these actions represent a floor, rather than a ceiling, to ambition. From an environmental and political perspective, it will be vital that this is the case. Other major emitters will need to show similar commitment.
The clear signaling in Copenhagen that China is committed to taking these actions unilaterally is encouraging, not least because it underpins growing business confidence that a new, potentially vast market for low-carbon goods and services is set to emerge. Whether these initial commitments will actually result in the kind of emission reductions demanded by the climate science remains to be seen, but the sheer scale of any low-carbon development in China is likely to have repercussions on the speed and cost of new technologies globally. This can only be a good thing.
EUROPEAN UNION
The EU – being cautious of the risk of being blamed for having no agreement at all – reluctantly endorsed the Accord, which was largely negotiated without it.
There is clear disappointment with the result in Europe, as expressed by Commission President Barroso: “This was the first experiment in working together, there are important points that have been agreed - after all it is an agreement. But the level of agreement is honestly not what we have been hoping for.”
That said, EU Member States seem to be divided in their interpretations of the outcome. The Swedish EU Presidency called the agreement “a disaster” while German Chancellor Merkel hailed the outcome as a “step, albeit a small one towards a global climate change architecture”.
The lack of a timeline to reach a legally binding agreement next year is a major shortcoming for the EU, believing it endangers a timely follow up of the Kyoto Protocol in 2013. However, this is very unlikely to influence the roll out and development of internal EU and Member State climate policies. Climate and energy officials in the UK, for example, have been clear that from a domestic perspective at least it is business-as-usual in Britain.
The big question now is whether the EU will raise its ambition to a unilateral 30% reduction target when Parties communicate their pledges in the annex of the Accord on January 31st. Many economic studies and reports show that meeting this target would require very limited extra domestic effort by the EU. There would also be clear benefits for the EU economy, though there is also opposition to this target in a number of newer Member States and influential business sectors.
11
The timing of the next council meetings is not in favour of the deadline to communicate the pledges. The informal environment minister’s council is unlikely to be able to decide this when it meets in late January ; the first Heads of State council meeting is planned for the beginning of February.
The other critical issue that climate ministers and officials will need to address early in 2010 is the EU’s international negotiating strategy. The absence of the EU from the final round of negotiations between the US and the BASIC group was a diplomatic failure. It underscored the EU’s current inability to match its much vaunted climate leadership and economic weight with real political influence and power.
The EU needs to find ways to regain an effective and influential role in shaping the international climate architecture. A combination of new ‘carrot and stick’ policies and measures is probable. The use of border tax adjustments (i.e. ‘carbon tariffs), for example, is one possible ‘stick’ that has previously been suggested. This controversial measure continues to have support in certain quarters but faces strong opposition in others.
INDIA
To date the outcome from Copenhagen has received little domestic attention in India as other political events have dominated national headlines. The Copenhagen Accord currently provides little political ammunition for either the government or the opposition parties, minimizing the level of parliamentary debate.
India, however, is likely to be satisfied with the overall outcome from Copenhagen, despite having expressed disappointment with the level of ambition actually achieved. The Copenhagen Accord does not compromise on any of India’s fundamental negotiating positions – for example, its opposition to binding emission reduction commitments for developing countries, and its stringent support for the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol. Furthermore, as a member of the BASIC group of countries, India has firmly established itself as one of the major players in the new political order, at least on climate change.
The agreement to a 2oC temperature target and the absence of any global emission reduction or GHG concentration figures also favors India. In the past India has been anxious to avoid these latter targets, fearing that they could be applied to India in the future. Other areas with good or satisfactory outcomes for India include ‘REDD plus’, financial support, and the flexibility mechanisms (CDM and JI).
Moving into 2010 and beyond, India will be aiming to build on its optimistic expectations from domestic technological innovations plus international technology transfers, as well as the financial support committed by developed countries.
The government has yet to make any announcement on the commitments and action plans it will be submitting by January 31st. The central elements of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, first released in 2008, and including the recently published Solar Mission, will most likely form the basis of any
submission made by India. Ideally, India’s commitments will include the 25% carbon intensity target it pledged before Copenhagen.

Doing the Deal in Copenhagen
Negotiating a new global deal on climate change has proved to be one of the most complex international processes in recent history. There are uncertainties over what countries are willing and able to do, the ability of cost-efficient technologies to deliver the needed emissions cut and the timing and cost of the effort required. And yet the political will to secure a strong agreement in Copenhagen is clearly in place.
At the heart of the deal is the question of how collectively we put global greenhouse gas emissions on a path that minimises the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate change. We know the technologies and policies needed to achieve this and we know the reductions that are required by 2020, the first milestone along the way. Delay is not an option, as this would require much sharper cuts in emissions in the future that would be more difficult to achieve, both politically and economically.
All major countries have now made ambitious pledges to reduce their emissions over the next decade. Although these are not yet quite good enough to secure a safe climate path, they constitute a major step in the right direction. Agreement in Copenhagen should at least ensure that the most ambitious of these pledges are translated into action, while negotiations should continue to find ways to bridge the gap between these pledges and what is ultimately needed. We cannot allow the desire for a perfect deal to delay the vital opportunity we now have to move forward.
Once a start has been made in making the necessary cuts, it is likely that they will be neither as hard nor as expensive as feared. Scaling up the low-carbon technologies we already have will bring costs down, drive further innovation and improve public acceptance of the changes needed. Therefore, to enable targets to be strengthened in the coming years, governments should put in place mechanisms that will allow ambition levels to be raised. These include:
· Setting themselves longer term targets, such as for 2025 or 2030, that will create political certainty and point out the long-term path;
· Establishing a review mechanism that will be able to recommend deeper cuts, based on the latest scientific, technological and economic knowledge, with a first review in 2015;
· Agreeing to develop Low Carbon Growth Plans that help as yet unidentified emission reduction opportunities to be uncovered;
· Providing financial support for a `fast-start' that enables immediate emissions reduction and builds the capacity for them to be scaled up.
Financing will also have to be made available, in particular to support mitigation efforts in developing countries. Here it is important that public money is used to maximise private sector investment. Deep and broad international carbon markets will play a crucial role in directing this investment towards the best opportunities. While short-term funding cannot be a substitute for more substantial flows later on, a real commitment to a fast-start, backed by new public money, will be the catalyst needed to put the agreement into action.
A deal is there to be had: now is the time to grasp it.

INTRODUCTION
The negotiations to secure a new global agreement that builds on and extends the achievements of the UN Framework Climate Convention on Climate Change are now entering the home straight. These negotiations cover a wide range of issues that affect almost every sector of the economy and the political system. Despite their immense complexity, at the heart of these negotiations lies one core question: how do we put global greenhouse gas emissions on a trajectory that minimizes the risk of dangerous and irreversible climate change?
To resolve this essential but broad question there are a number of more specific questions that will need to be answered by governments in Copenhagen:
· By how much must we reduce emissions below current levels in the short, medium and long-term? · What does this mean in terms of effort to cut emissions from what they would otherwise be in 2020? · How should the responsibility for emissions reduction be allocated between countries? · Are the commitments made to date sufficient? If not, how can we obtain the additional necessary emissions reduction? · How much additional funding is needed to finance this emission reduction and how can it be provided? · How should responsibility for this funding be shared between countries? · What mechanisms are needed to build confidence in the agreement to facilitate and guarantee its longevity?
Other areas being dealt with in the negotiations ­ adaptation, technology development and transfer, governance, measurement, reporting and verifying, and capacity building ­ are of course essential pieces of the climate policy jigsaw and we address some of the key institutional and governance issues later in this paper. However, if countries are unable to reach a satisfactory consensus on the crucial questions listed above, then most of these other issues become redundant. Adaptation will then be the only option and one that may already be closed down.

The emissions reduction objective: an achievable safe climate path

Heads of government around the world have already largely accepted that a safe climate path for emissions is one that keeps the average global temperature increase to no greater than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, the level above which the scientific community believes the risk of irreversible and possibly runaway climate change becomes unacceptably high. This is equal to around 1.2°C above current levels.01

To have a reasonable chance of achieving this, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be stabilized at no higher than 450 parts per million (ppm), about 60% higher than that in pre-industrial times but only 15% higher than today's.02 This, in turn, requires cutting global emissions to around 60% below the current levels by mid-century. To achieve this, while avoiding the need for excessively abrupt and expensive reductions further on in the future, emissions need to peak within the next ten years and then fall by an average of around 3% a year thereafter. Delaying these cuts in emissions, would mean that emissions would peak at a later date, that the starting point for the necessary cuts would be higher, and that much sharper reductions would consequently be required, estimated by some to be as much as 8% a year.03 This is not likely to be technologically feasible, nor is it likely to be acceptable economically or politically. Without action, we are likely to be closer to 750 or 800 ppm, which would result in a 4 or even 6 degree increase in average global temperatures.04

It is the cumulative effect of the total emissions released into the atmosphere over the next forty years that would lead to higher global temperatures, so we can express this global emissions objective in terms of the maximum permitted annual emissions at the end of each decade through to 2050. These figures are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 below. What is evident is that there needs to be a major downward shift in the carbon intensity of economic activity if we are to sustain economic growth at the same time as keeping global emissions on a path compatible with 2°C.

Sources: Adapted from data by IPCC (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Synthesis Report; Project Catalyst (2009) Taking stock; Stern, N (2009) Meeting the Climate Challenge.
The immediate objective for 2020 is clear. Instead of allowing unconstrained emissions to rise to close to 58Gt (billion tonnes) CO2e, some 15% above current levels, we need to find and deliver 14Gt of emissions reduction.05 This is the challenge for Copenhagen.
We also know how we can obtain the emissions cut we need over the next decade. McKinsey & Company have calculated that 19Gt of emissions reduction are available around the world at a cost of less than 60/tCO2e (tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent), with the vast majority costing less than 30/tCO2e. And nearly a third of this potential can be realized through energy efficiency improvements that pay for themselves through energy cost savings. In fact 70% of the available reductions ­ roughly equal to the 2020 emissions reduction challenge ­ can come from investing in just three areas: improved energy efficiency, low carbon energy (principally switching sources from coal to renewables, nuclear and gas) and forestry (mostly from reduced tropical deforestation).06 The policies required to achieve these reductions are well-known and have all been successfully implemented, albeit to date at a smaller scale than necessary, in various countries around the world. The challenge may be large but it is certainly manageable.
Sharing the responsibility for meeting the 2020 challenge
Nevertheless, meeting the 2020 challenge will certainly require some fairly major changes to how we manage our economies. It will require additional investment and will create winners and losers as old technologies and sectors are phased out and new ones appear. It will also impact different countries in different ways. Therefore an approach to sharing the responsibility for the 14GtCO2e reduction between countries needs to be found that is both fair and efficient.
There are a number of well-accepted facts and principles that can help guide this task:
· Unless all major countries and regions participate, it will be impossible to secure the emissions reduction that is needed;
· Where the emissions reduction actually take place is immaterial. Therefore the geographical location of policies and technology changes need not correspond to where the cost burden is felt;
· Linked to the above, an agreement that is cost-effective, i.e. which secures the needed emissions reduction at the lowest possible cost, will be more economically and politically sustainable than one that is seen to impose unnecessarily high costs;
· Fairness demands that industrialized countries ­ with their predominant share of historic emissions, higher current per capita emissions levels and greater wealth and technological capacity ­ should act first and cover at least some of the costs incurred by developing countries making emissions reductions;
· The fairness principle also suggests that countries in similar situations should make similar levels of commitment; · A collaborative approach will bring greater cost-effectiveness, speed up the deployment of new technologies and
build trust between countries that each is doing its fair share; · Investors and business require reasonable long-term certainty in order to make investments to deploy low-carbon-
technology alternatives that may not be the short-term, least-cost option.
From the above, we can identify the basic criteria for determining how the responsibility for emissions reduction should be allocated.
Firstly, industrialized countries should undertake all the mitigation options that are available at a reasonable cost. The McKinsey analysis cited above suggests that around 5Gt worth of emissions reduction can be achieved at a marginal cost of less than 60/tCO2e, with the average cost likely to be around a quarter of this amount.
Secondly, it seems reasonable to expect all countries to commit to self-financing those measures that can achieve emissions reduction at zero net cost and/or which generate co-benefits that more than outweigh the initial investment. Many efficiency improvements and some agricultural practices fall into this category, although for some less-developed countries technology and capacity support may be needed for them to be viable. For developing countries the potential abatement that falls into this category and which should therefore form part of their own contribution comes to a total of around 3Gt of emissions reduction.
Thirdly, the lowest-cost options for finding the remaining 6GtCO2e of reductions that are needed to meet the target level of 44GtCO2e in 2020 are to be found in developing countries.07 However, since realizing these options would not be economically viable in the absence of a carbon policy, the additional cost necessary to make them as attractive as the carbon-intensive, business-as-usual (BAU) alternatives should be covered by the industrialized countries.
Within these `net positive cost' opportunities, there are two groups. The first group comprises those actions for which putting a price on carbon emissions would act as sufficient incentive for them to be implemented. These principally include investments in technologies that are well-known and commercially tried and tested and for which the necessary skills and institutional conditions are in place. Examples of this include switching from coal to gas for power generation or to some renewable sources of energy and the upgrading of cement production. These abatement options can be financed cost-effectively through the international carbon market, via an expanded Clean Development Mechanism or via a new approach for crediting reductions at the sectoral level. The volume of emissions reduction that can be achieved will depend crucially on the international price of carbon; this, in turn, will be determined by the level of ambition embodied in industrialized country targets. The more ambitious these are, the greater will be the flow of financing to developing countries, and the larger the volume of emissions reduction that can be achieved.

The second group comprises of `net positive cost' opportunities actions where a carbon price stimulus will be insufficient to change investment decisions, either because cost is not the main barrier to implementation or because a transparent and liquid market cannot readily be created. Much of the abatement potential from reducing tropical deforestation falls into this category and can be best supported through direct funding.
Thus we can see that to achieve the 14GtCO2e in emissions reduction needed in 2020, a reasonable division of responsibility would be for:
· Industrialized countries to cut 5Gt through domestic action; · Developing countries to contribute 3Gt through measures that come at net zero or negative cost; and · The remaining 6Gt to take place in developing countries but be dependent on funding by industrialized countries
through a combination of private sector investments via carbon markets and direct public funding.

The first step: consolidating existing pledges and commitments

Reflecting the political commitment of leaders to secure a successful agreement in Copenhagen, almost all major countries have proposed significant pledges or commitments to reducing or limiting the growth of their emissions. A selection of these is shown in Table 2 below.

The range of numbers that are given for target emission levels in 2020 reflects the fact that countries have used different approaches in expressing their pledges and established conditions for meeting their more ambitious aspirations. For example, most industrialized countries have set economy-wide, absolute emissions reduction targets, but with their deeper cuts being contingent on other countries doing the same and on a global agreement being reached in Copenhagen. Most developing countries, on the other hand, have set targets relative to BAU levels, or in terms of energy or carbon intensity, meaning that the final result in absolute terms will depend on their level of economic growth over the coming decade. Moreover, in many cases, part or all of developing countries' commitments are conditional upon sufficient financial support being made available.
If one aggregates the lower and upper bounds of the pledges across countries,08 we can identify two scenarios:
· `B asic Action' scenario: comprising only unconditional national commitments, targets and policies already enshrined in law;
· `Ambitious Action' scenario: comprising of pledges that allow countries to meet their highest current levels of ambition. Subject to stipulated conditions being met.
The predicted impact of both these scenarios on global emission levels in 2020 and how these compare with the 2°C path outlined earlier are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3.
The first conclusion that can be drawn is that in both scenarios, especially that of `Ambitious Action', emissions are significantly lower in 2020 than they would otherwise have been and represent a significant collective effort. The first task for leaders in Copenhagen is therefore to lock in the commitments that make up the `Ambitious Action' scenario.
Nevertheless, even this scenario is not sufficient to put the world on a 2°C pathway. If no further reductions are achieved, it is likely that the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases will exceed 550ppm and that the global temperature increase will be in the order of 3.5°C. To get on the 2°C path another 5Gt of emissions reduction will need to be found.09
The aggregate impact of current pledges and the additional effort that is needed can also be broken down between industrialized and developing countries. This is shown in Figures 3 and 4. The 2°C target pathway is broken down between the two regions on the basis proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): absolute reductions by industrialized countries of between 25% and 40% and reductions by developing countries (seen in the Figure below) of between 15% and 30%.10
Sources: Adapted from data by IPCC (2007) Climate Change 2007: The Synthesis Report; Project Catalyst (2009) Taking stock; and Stern, N (2009) Meeting the Climate Challenge.
As in Figure 2, in both scenarios it can be seen that countries would achieve an important reduction in emissions below their BAU levels in 2020, by 4Gt and 5Gt respectively, under the `Ambitious Action' scenario getting quite close to the lower end of their target range. Nevertheless, even if both groups of countries were to reach the lower end of their target range this would not be sufficient to take emissions to a level consistent with the 2°C pathway and would fill only 2GtCO2e of the 5GtCO2e gap.11

Bridging the gap
Securing the extra 5Gt of emissions reduction will be no easy task, even though assessments of the 2020 mitigation potential show that further emissions reduction is available at a reasonable cost. Following the principle of achieving emissions reduction in the most cost-effective way suggests that one area where further abatement may be possible is through increased efforts to reduce deforestation in developing countries, similar to the ambitious contributions proposed by Brazil and Indonesia. However, this would be contingent on industrialized countries providing the necessary additional public funding. There may also be more low-cost abatement opportunities in developing countries in the energy and industrial sectors, which could be financed through international carbon markets. However, for this to be effective, industrialized countries would need to adopt more ambitious targets themselves, as this would generate a greater demand for international offsets.
While governments should strive to secure the necessary extra emissions reduction, it may not be possible to deal with them all in Copenhagen. This should not be seen as failure; although it is important that the gap is bridged as quickly as possible. We have already noted that the pledges under the `Ambitious Action' scenario are a major first step in the right direction. It is probable that the true cost will be much lower than originally predicted, as has been the case with other environmental policies in the past, such as clean air legislation in the United States and the Montreal Protocol. The very fact that all the world's major economies have taken on meaningful targets and enacted policies to achieve them, makes it likely that business will begin to shy away from high carbon investments, even where this is not actually mandated, in order to avoid the risk of being left with stranded assets.
What is important is that mechanisms and tools be put in place to enable increased levels of ambition to be included as soon as possible after Copenhagen. There are three immediate ways of doing this, which complement each other:
1. Establishing a review process to determine the additional abatement that is required and available.
The science of climate change and our understanding of the technological options for reducing emissions and for building resilience to climate impacts are continually evolving. Since it is this knowledge that frames the policy decisions that are made domestically and internationally, it is essential that this is used to inform the process of reviewing and setting new targets.
Therefore, governments in Copenhagen should establish a regular review mechanism that assesses the latest evidence on the abatement that is needed, the options that have emerged for achieving this abatement and any new knowledge of the costs involved. This assessment, performed under the direction of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), would lead to recommendations that would form the basis for a new round of negotiations on the collective and individual country targets required. This process would not amount to re-opening the Copenhagen agreement. Quite the opposite, it would constitute a way of enabling ambition levels to be raised without the need for full-blown negotiations.
The IPCC is due to publish its Fifth Assessment Report in 2014. The following year, 2015, which coincides with the half-way mark between now and 2020, would therefore seem an appropriate moment for the first of those reviews. Subsequent reviews could then proceed on a five-yearly basis.
2. Setting medium and longer term targets that establish the overall level of ambition, and thereby sending a clear signal to business and investors about policy directions.
While 2020 targets provide the spur to immediate action to cut emissions, goals for 2030 and beyond, which are enshrined in both international agreements and national legislation, can play an important role in influencing decisions about investment in areas such as power plants, public infrastructure and other projects whose operations are measured in decades rather than years. Similarly they can provide an important incentive for entrepreneurs and early stage investors in clean technologies, by indicating that markets will exist for their products and services. Where one country's 2020 targets are not considered by the majority of others to be sufficient, setting a much tighter cap for the post-2020 period could be an effective way of demonstrating that an adequate level of ambition exists.


13

As Table 2 above shows, many countries, from both the industrialized and developing world, have already done this, setting targets for both 2030 and 2050. This could be formalized in Copenhagen by agreeing on the collective long-term goal and providing a mechanism for countries to lodge their associated commitments. Key elements coming out of Copenhagen in this connection could include:
· Reaffirming the collective commitment to keep the average global temperature increase to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. As we have seen, this sets the parameter for the overall safe emissions path over the next 40 years;
· A global goal that emissions should fall to below half their 1990 levels, or less than 20GtCO2e, by mid-century. This could be accompanied by agreement that total emissions in 2030 should not exceed 35GtCO2e12;
· A commitment by industrialized countries to cut their emissions by at least 80% below 1990 levels, or down to two tonnes per capita in 2050.13 This would create a clear signal for business in these countries, while also demonstrating to developing countries that they will have the `space' to grow while cutting their carbon intensity.
3. Creating Low Carbon Growth Plans (LCGPs) that allow further abatement opportunities to be identified.
While providing the means to ensure that emissions are kept to a safe trajectory, the targets discussed above will only be achieved if they are backed by solid national and regional policies and the necessary financing. To help facilitate this, all industrialized and major emerging economies should set out Low Carbon Growth Plans (LCGPs).
For industrialized countries the LCGPs should show how they plan to meet their targets, thereby providing credibility to their commitments and offering an indication of the expected level of carbon market financing that will be made available. Developing country LCGPs should also lay out how they propose to make their pledged contributions and, in addition, show what they will do on their own, what can be achieved through carbon market financing and where direct funding and other support is needed.
If designed well, LCGPs can provide a key tool for ensuring that a coherent set of actions that is consistent with national development priorities is developed, including the allocation of public finance, attracting external private sector investment into the low-carbon transformation of the economy, building confidence domestically and internationally, and the sharing of experiences. LGCPs provide the most direct means for identifying as yet undiscovered abatement opportunities, as well as enabling the raising of levels of ambition.
LCGPs will vary from country to country, depending on national circumstances and priorities. In those countries where the capacity to generate economy-wide plans does not yet exist, a set of proposed Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) could be proposed, covering those sectors where policies can be put in place and that are in need of support. Where possible, these should aim to use the same metrics to facilitate monitoring, comparison of progress and assessment of investment opportunities.

Sharing the cost of reducing emissions
An agreement that successfully puts the world on, or close to, the 2°C path and that drives a rapid transition to a climate resilient, low-carbon global economy will require a major mobilisation and redirection of both public and private capital. In particular, as stated above, new financing will be needed:
· To finance the additional investment costs associated with mitigation strategies in developing countries14 and make capital loans available for abatement options that generate positive returns but for which capital availability is a limiting factor;
· To support Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and other natural sinks in developing countries (i.e. REDD+, which we discuss later on).
In addition to that, new financing will be needed:
· To increase publicly supported Research, Development and Diffusion (RD&D) of new technologies for both mitigation and adaptation;
· To build institutional and technical capacity in developing countries, including: for the design of Low Carbon Growth Plans; monitoring, reporting and verification; needs assessment; and programme development;
· To cover the costs of adaptation, particularly in poorer, more vulnerable countries.
In order to drive long-term planning and investment decisions effectively, the funding in each of these areas will need to be genuinely new, additional and predictable.
Volume and source of funds
Estimates of the total quantum of financing required depend on critical assumptions about future energy prices, rates of economic growth, the cost of different abatement options, the response of the climate to increased warming and associated impacts and the speed and effectiveness of the global policy response. Nevertheless, most studies put the annual amount needed to cover the incremental costs of adaptation and mitigation in developing countries at between US$100 billion and US$200 billion by 2020, with approximately two-thirds for mitigation and the remainder for adaptation, technology and capacity building.15
Whichever numbers are used, this represents a significant increase on the current annual flows of US$9 billion for mitigation in developing countries, of which three quarters flow through the CDM, while approximately US$600 million is allocated to the Climate Investment Funds and around US$200 million is committed to adaptation through the Global Environment Facility.16 A deal in Copenhagen should therefore have at its heart a commitment to generate financing of at least US$100 billion a year by 2020. It is important that countries are committed to the right scale of finance from the outset ­ while small amounts of money can effect important changes, without a transformational approach, we will only be incurring higher costs for the future. Of this total, some US$10 billion needs to be deployed immediately as part of a fast-start provision in the agreement (see below).17

By no means all of this money needs to be raised from public finances, although public money will be the predominant source of funding for adaptation, technology development, capacity building and REDD+. If deployed effectively, public funds can be used to leverage significant investment from the private sector. It is worth bearing in mind that the more ambitious the emissions cap that is adopted by industrialized countries, the greater the (private sector) investments that will flow through the carbon markets and the less that will be required from public purses. Several sources of public funding have been suggested in the academic literature and through the UN negotiations.18

· US$10-15 billion could be raised through the auctioning of emission allowances to the aviation and shipping sectors as part of a market-based sectoral agreement;
· A similar amount could be generated by auctioning a portion of the emissions permits that make up the industrialized country cap and/or the allowances allocated to companies under national and regional emissions trading schemes;
· A levy on international emissions trading, similar to the 2% levy that currently applies to Clean Development Mechanism projects, with the total dependent on the size of the global carbon market;
· Use of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and other international financial instruments; · Direct government support, through additional Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) and other forms of
public finance (of up to US$30 billion, including voluntary contributions from both industrialized and developing countries) and concessional debt (of US$6-10 billion), with contribution levels set using a metric like that contained in the Mexican Green Fund proposal; and · Use of public balance sheets to leverage private investment, for example by providing risk guarantees.

It is likely that a combination of all of the above will be needed and governments in Copenhagen should agree to both the overall level to be reached by 2020 and to targets for funding from bunker fuel allowances, and assigned amount auctions. As well as agreement on this overall target, individual countries should commit firm amounts of public funding in the immediate, short-term and should have these commitments recorded, monitored and verified as part of their broader obligations. Initially, this direct public funding will need to be the primary source to ensure a predictable flow of funds until the other mechanisms can take over; as other sources expand so the need for additional public support will be reduced.

Alongside the public funding, it is essential that private sector, low-carbon financing is mobilised. Indeed, as emissions reduction targets become more ambitious, the price of carbon (and fossil-based energy) rises, supporting policies (such as efficiency and renewable energy standards) are increasingly put in place and the capacity to develop investible emissions reduction projects and programmes improves, so it is reasonable to assume that more mitigation financing will come from the private sector.

The main source of private sector financing for emissions reduction in the developing world is likely to be the carbon market. An expanded CDM would allow investment both individual projects and programmatic approaches and have greater capacity for processing projects quickly and involving more countries. This could be complemented by new crediting systems that enable the transformation of whole sectors to be financed based on pre-established low-carbon plans. With sufficiently tight caps in industrialized countries, these carbon market mechanisms can drive large quantities of investment ­ possibly as much as US$50-100 billion per year by 2020 ­ into cost-effective greenhouse gas abatement. This is about half the additional annual investment that the International Energy Agency (IEA) says will be needed in developing countries by 2030 for low-carbon restructuring of their energy production and consumption.19

Crucially, however, carbon markets are not and cannot be the only mechanisms used to mobilise low-carbon private finance and need to be complemented and supported by other approaches. For example, energy efficiency improvement programmes are likely to be financed more successfully through the creation of low cost debt facilities that help to cover the sometimes high, initial investment costs that are then recouped through energy bills and other methods for capturing reduced energy costs. REDD programmes are also unlikely to be best served by carbon markets in the short-term, while blended public and private finance in consolidated funds that are linked to both policies and concrete outcomes could prove very effective.

Given the importance of REDD, it is essential that early action is taken in this area. Forestry and agriculture account for more than 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and, as we have seen, provide as much as 50% of the cost-effective emissions abatement opportunities in 2020. Tropical deforestation is the largest source of land-based emissions and thus provides the most urgent and immediate opportunity for action. Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, along with enhancement, conservation, and sustainable management of forests (collectively referred to as `REDD+') has emerged as one of the strongest areas of consensus for multilateral agreement and action in Copenhagen. An immediate investment of 15-25 billion could reduce global deforestation rates by 25% in 2015 with a corresponding reduction in emissions of 7GtCO2e.20


16

In the short-term at least, however, the carbon market will not be sufficient to finance the necessary scale of reductions. Specific fund structures will be needed to:
· Support the creation of the necessary technical and institutional infrastructure; · Support (smaller) governments in developing alternative development plans; · Fund projects and programmes that reduce deforestation; and · Finance deforestation policies at the national/regional level.21
Catalysing a Fast-start
In addition to the components above, countries should agree a fast-start mechanism, comprising initial funding and technical support to build capacity in developing countries, that will enable action to start immediately without waiting for 2013 (the likely starting point for formal commitments) or for the completion of all the legal work that remains to be finalised after Copenhagen. This fast-start funding would be used for the following:
· Help rainforest nations build capacity for REDD and deliver initial reductions in deforestation; · Build the infrastructure necessary to expand the international carbon market; · Support the development of Low Carbon Growth Plans and NAMAs; · Create and strengthen institutional capacity in developing countries for: project delivery; monitoring, reporting
and verification of emissions reductions; technology development and diffusion; and adaptation planning; · Implementation of short-term preventative adaptation measures; · Accelerate the development and diffusion of next generation technology solutions.22
As noted above, these fast-start activities will require at least US$10 billion in funding to be made available as soon as possible. This money should be put on the table in Copenhagen and placed into an international fund (or, if not, set aside and earmarked as being from national budgets and registered as such with the UNFCCC) by industrialized countries from public budgets, over and above their existing ODA commitments, and be independent of final agreement on the legal treaty that will be constructed on the Copenhagen agreement. Beyond enabling the critical actions outlined above, the provision of these funds would represent a significant gesture of commitment towards, and help to build confidence in, the delivery of the Copenhagen agreement.
Governing the Finances
A well-designed and managed governance system that provides transparency, guarantees that funds are directed where they are most needed and is flexible enough to respond to a wide range of needs in countries at differing stages of development is the third key ingredient for a successful climate framework. Although there are disagreements about the transparency, representativeness and effectiveness of existing institutions, these should nevertheless be used wherever possible to avoid long delays in putting the architecture in place, while still dealing directly with the issues that have been raised.
Foremost amongst these issues is ensuring greater ownership of the funds by developing countries, in particular through a more balanced representation on their boards and management structures. Moreover, the funds ­ especially those relying heavily on public money ­ should be accountable to the UNFCCC, again to ensure representative decision-making, broad geographical use of funding and to ensure that disbursement does not respond excessively to the priorities of `donors'. Equally important is ensuring that the respective institutions have the capacity to deal with large-scale financing ­ at levels far larger than existing flows of climate finance ­ using programmatic and strategic approaches rather than purely project-based ones, and without high levels of procedural complexity and slow decision-making.

A COMMON FRAMEWORK
The creation of a registry system for aggregating, measuring, reviewing and strengthening national commitments, together with agreeing institutions for inspecting and auditing emission inventories and performance reports on commitments, represent the foundations of the new agreement and will be necessary to facilitate the meeting of commitments made on emissions reductions and on finance discussed above.
These foundations will facilitate comparisons between countries' commitments and their performance in meeting them, enable assistance to be provided in a timely manner to those having difficulty meeting their obligations, help channel necessary financial and technological support, and strengthen the expansion of international emissions trading. In the case of emissions trading, consistency on how emissions and emission reduction credits are assessed and measured is essential to promoting trust in the units being traded, ensuring full convertibility between units from different sectors and regions and thereby allowing the market to seek out and channel financing to the least cost abatement options efficiently.
There are five critical areas needing agreement:
1. Comprehensive and transparent reporting and the review of national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a timely manner.
A significant amount of work was done in developing the Marrakech Accords to establish a rigorous scientificallybased system for estimating, reporting and reviewing GHG emissions from developed country Parties under an international system.23 These efforts were embodied in a series of decisions taken by governments and subsequently implemented by all developed countries. The vast majority of the provisions agreed are applicable to whatever kind of agreement is reached in Copenhagen and should serve as the core elements for reporting and reviewing GHG emissions under this new international agreement.
2. A transparent mechanism for registering countries' commitments and actions.
The ability of countries to have confidence in the commitments and contributions of their peers is essential for building trust in the international climate policy regime. This is one of the reasons for asking all countries to prepare Low Carbon Growth Plans that detail how they will meet their commitments and that can be used as a metric for monitoring progress over time. However, it is not only LCGPs that need to be open to scrutiny, an international registry system that allows LCGPs, emissions reduction and commitments to provide climate finance to be lodged, reported, monitored and assessed and verified would enable independent assessment of the comparability of different commitments and of progress towards meeting them. This registry should be operated by the UNFCCC and supported by a cross-country panel of experts to provide independent analysis and review. Information contained in the registry would be publicly available, thereby also facilitating exchange of best practice on policies, measures and other successful approaches to addressing both mitigation and adaptation.
3. Common standards for reporting and reviewing GHG emissions resulting from land use, land-use change and forestry.
Methods for estimating emissions and emission reductions from land use, land-use change and forestry aim to allow Parties to compare the level of effort among countries, to promote linking of emission trading systems and to ensure that land use, land-use change and forestry credits that are purchased from another Party comply with national laws. Common standards would ensure that national baselines are set consistently with each other; that the same definitions are used to assess forest cover, deforestation and activities designed to maintain or increase forest cover; and that the same methodologies are used to account for natural disturbances such as fires or pestilence. Countries have already adopted rules for estimating land-use change emission inventories based on IPCC Guidelines and IPCC Good Practice Guidance and for reporting them using a common reporting format. Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries have also adopted criteria and guidelines for defining, estimating and accounting for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, along with the accounting rules for forest management, cropland management, grazing land management, and revegetation. Given the work that developing these rules has involved and the high degree of consensus around them, it makes obvious sense for countries to use them as the basis for the new agreement.
4. Common standards for national GHG registries and the transfer of units between entities in different countries.
National GHG registries are the basic infrastructure necessary for properly functioning carbon markets. By holding emissions units held by entities operating in their jurisdictions and by ensuring the emissions trades between these entities are accurately recorded and, via an International Transactions Log (ITL), consistent with pre-established rules, they underpin the integrity of emissions trading. The ITL also provides an independent check that unit holdings are being recorded accurately in registries.
It should be self-evident that internationally agreed standards for registries are essential to prevent double counting as well as possibly fraudulent transactions between entities, for facilitating access to the international offset market, for tracking the purchase of offsets by entities and countries, and for determining compliance with national laws. This should therefore be a central part of the framework agreed in Copenhagen.
5. Common standards for global carbon markets.
In order to operate effectively and efficiently, carbon markets need to have high levels of transparency, stability and, where more than one market is linked together, common operating rules and principles. In establishing the current global carbon market, a wide range of internationally agreed methodologies and guidelines have already been developed that govern the trading and issuance in the global carbon market of carbon permits and credits and include rules for emissions reporting, basic conditions for participating in carbon markets (such as having wellmanaged inventories that meet global standards) and rules to allow and govern the consistency of offsets, so that one tonne of emissions reduction is the same and verified to the same standard in all countries. Maintaining these standards, and building on them where necessary through the international process rather than relying on an ad hoc process of national standards, will ensure transparent comparability of efforts and smooth the development of an efficient, global carbon market.

A CLIMATE GROUP ASSESSMENT
JANUARY 2010

Introduction
The 15th UN Climate Conference concluded late last month with the ambiguous adoption, or `noting', of a `Copenhagen Accord'. This political document was delivered at the end of two weeks of tense and often confusing negotiations. Its exact legal status ­ and hence its implications - remain the subject of debate and it leaves unanswered many of the difficult questions that have bedeviled climate negotiations for much of the past two years. Despite this, the Copenhagen Accord represents an important milestone in international efforts to address climate change. For the first time, the US, China and all other major economies have committed to take concrete and verifiable action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; new money has been put on the table; and a long-term objective ­ keeping the average global temperature increase to below 2° above pre-industrial levels ­ has been adopted. While many details are still to be determined, the Accord contains the seeds for a new, country-driven, `bottom-up' approach to tackling climate change that could potentially offer an effective route to accelerated global emission reductions. The risks, however, are considerable. In the absence of any internationally agreed medium- and long-term emission targets, backed by a legally-binding agreement, much will depend on whether governments embrace a `race to the top' mentality or succumb to lowest common denominator climate policies. The next 12-24 months will be critical in determining which path countries choose.
* * *
The remainder of this paper is divided into the following four short sections: · A summary of the key events during the two week summit · A brief overview of the core elements of the Copenhagen Accord · Our assessment of the Accord · Our assessment of the impacts and implications for the US, China, the EU and India.

Summary of the Copenhagen Conference
Officials arrived in Copenhagen with over 200 pages of draft treaty text covering negotiations under both the Kyoto Protocol and the overarching UN Climate Convention. Their objective was to reduce this stack of papers to a manageable size in order to present climate ministers, and subsequently heads of government, with a limited set of options for final negotiation and adoption.
The hope and expectation was that countries would agree new binding emission cuts for developed countries, either under the Kyoto Protocol or a new agreement, as well as strengthen the Climate Convention by committing developing countries to nationally appropriate mitigation action. Parties were also seeking to reach agreement on issues of adaptation, reducing deforestation and forest degradation (REDD), technology development and transfer, and financing to support climate actions in developing countries.
While negotiators made considerable progress in the first week in significantly reducing the length of the draft texts, they were unable to resolve core deadlock issues. A critical disagreement was over the `legal form' of a Copenhagen outcome. Developed countries' call for a single new agreement that combined the outcomes from the Kyoto and Convention track negotiations was strongly opposed by developing countries, who stated that they would not allow `Kyoto to be killed'. This, in particular, reflected their concern that the core principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities - under which wealthy nations are required to act first - would be undermined or abandoned.
Ministers therefore arrived for the second week to find considerable gaps still existing between parties. Closed-door ministerial discussions made some progress early in the week but failed to provide a break through. In an effort to make progress, the Danish host and president of the Conference attempted to introduce a `President's text' in order to ensure that an outcome of some kind was ready for the 120 heads of state to adopt on the final day. Unfortunately, this was seen by many developing countries as a way to circumvent the party-driven process of the negotiations and led to more delay and distrust.
With the arrival of heads of state and little more than 24 hours left of the conference, a select, but representative group of approximately 26 countries met to hammer out a deal. Behind closed doors presidents, prime ministers and their senior advisors worked throughout the final day.
Late in the evening President Obama announced that a deal had been done with China, India, Brazil and South Africa (the so-called `BASIC' group) on a `Copenhagen Accord'. Endorsement (often reluctant) from other countries, including the EU, followed. Consensus, however, was not achieved, with a small but vocal group of countries unwilling to accept the outcome.
2

Wrangling about the status of the Accord continued in the final plenary session through Friday night and into Saturday morning, with anger, weariness and even despair characterizing the exchanges between Parties. Eventually, a combination of minor amendments and a change to chair ensured that a conclusion was reached. The final result, however ­ a formal UNFCCC decision that ""takes note of the Copenhagen Accord"" ­ leaves a certain level of ambiguity about the legal status of the agreement. This may create difficulties when discussions on implementing the Accord begin. Although a deal was ultimately done, there is widespread recognition that the Copenhagen Accord is neither a perfect nor a final deal ­ a fact acknowledged by President Obama and other leaders. Indeed, given the lack of detail and the range of crucial elements missing from the Accord, 2010 will be busy and critical year for international climate negotiations if the world is to realistically achieve the kind of emission reductions demanded by the climate science.

What is in the Copenhagen Accord?
The Copenhagen Accord is a short, simple document of just over two pages (see www.unfccc.int for a copy). Its structure and content mirror the `Bali Action Plan', which has guided the Climate Convention (UNFCCC) negotiations over the past two years.
The key points of the Accord are as follows:
· On the politics: acknowledgement of the seriousness of the problem and need for urgent, collective action in line with existing principles (e.g. CBDR1)
· On the science: endorsement of the IPCC's recommendation that global temperature increase be kept below 2oC.
· On adaptation: agreement that developed countries will provide adequate and predictable financial, technical and capacity-building support to developing countries.
· On developed country mitigation: agreement that Annex I parties will commit to quantified economywide emission reductions by 2020 (although with no individual or aggregate targets given), with targets submitted to the UNFCCC by 31 January 2010. These targets, as well as financing to support developing country climate action, are to be monitored, reported and verified.
· On developing country mitigation: agreement that non-Annex I parties will implement mitigation actions that are monitored, reported and verified. These actions are to be submitted to the UNFCCC by 31 January 2010. Action by the poorest and most vulnerable countries is voluntary.
· On Monitoring, Reporting, Verification (MRV): agreement that unilateral developing country mitigation action will be subject to domestic MRV'ing with ""international consultation and analysis"" that respects ""national sovereignty""; agreement that mitigation action supported by developed countries will be subject to international MRV'ing. Both developed and developing country MRV'ing will be subject to existing and to-be-agreed UNFCCC guidelines.
· On finance levels: commitment by developed countries to provide US$30 billion in short-term financing between 2010 and 2012 and to mobilize US$100 billion per annum by 2020. This will be from public, private, multilateral and alternative sources. Funding will be used for mitigation, adaptation, technology transfer and capacity-building in developing countries.
· On financial architecture: agreement to establish a `Copenhagen Green Climate Fund' which will receive a significant proportion of the above finance flows. Also the establishment of a `High Level Panel' to study the contribution of potential sources of revenue.
· On `REDD plus': agreement that a mechanism to mobilize funds to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and support conservation is needed.
· On technology: agreement to establish a `technology mechanism' to accelerate the transfer and development of mitigation and adaptation technologies.
1 UNFCCC short-hand for `common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities'.

· On markets: acknowledgement that markets enhance the cost-effectiveness of and promote mitigation actions. Implicit reference to benefits of emissions crediting or trading mechanisms to support low-carbon development in developing countries.
· On review of the Accord: a ""call"" to assess implementation of the Accord by 2015, with consideration of a 1.5oC temperature target.

Our assessment of the Accord
As noted above the Copenhagen Accord is neither a perfect nor a final global climate deal. It certainly falls short of the kind of comprehensive, ambitious and legally-binding agreement that was envisaged when countries adopted the Bali Road Map in December 2007. The Accord is not without merit, however. There are both good and not-so-good (or missing) aspects to it.
The good bits
· Having the US, China, India and other major developing countries sign up to a joint climate agreement for the first time.
· All of these countries also making unconditional national pledges to either cut or slow the growth of their emissions and/or implement specific measures to achieve this.
· Securing agreement on limiting average global temperature increase to 2oC or less. · Resolution of the monitoring, reporting and verification issue relating to developing country mitigation
action (a previous deadlock issue). · Developed countries' commitment to provide US$30 billion of short-term funding through to 2012, and
US$100 billion per annum of long-term funding by 2020, close to the level many had been demanding.
The not-so-good (or missing) bits
· Lack of a long-term global emission reduction goal (e.g. 50% reduction of emissions by 2050). · Lack of both individual and aggregate absolute emission targets for developed countries for 2020. · Lack of relative emission reduction targets for developing countries for 2020 (i.e. deviation from BAU
trajectories). · Absence of any reference to a global emissions peaking date, or even a developed country peaking
date, meaning that, together with the above, no clear pathway for emissions has been agreed. · No mention of a timetable for concluding a legally binding agreement. · Little or no reference to the need for, and role of, expanded carbon markets and no clarity over the
future of the CDM and other market-based instruments. · The uncertainty created over the future of the UNFCCC process, and particularly the Kyoto Protocol. · Lack of any obvious mechanism for regularly ratcheting up levels of ambition (apart from the 2015
review).
Our overall assessment is that Accord represents an important political step, which, if implemented with ambition and in a spirit of cooperation, has the potential to unlock real and significant action at both national and international levels. However, this is conditional on immediate, concrete and ongoing commitment from all major economies beginning in early 2010.
6

Countries need to demonstrate that they are in a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. Filling in the gaps noted above would be a good starting point. The first critical signal will be the commitments and actions that countries are required to submit to the UNFCCC by January 31st. Other key events to look for include the successful passage of effective energy and climate legislation in the US during the first half of 2010, and early confirmation of the sources and precise levels of `fast-track' financing from developed countries.
At present, the pledges made by Annex I parties and the large developing countries fall short of the emission cuts recommended by climate scientists and, as a consequence, the pathway to the 2° target explicitly referenced in the Copenhagen Accord. A five billion ton emission shortfall in 2020 (comparable to the EU's total current annual emissions) is likely even if all the major emitters commit to their most ambitious current pledges. International discussions over the coming year will need to focus on how to bridge this gap. The agreement in Copenhagen to extend the mandates of both the Convention and Protocol negotiating groups for another year provides the fora for these discussions to take place. Countries may also look to the G20 and Major Economies Forum (MEF) to make additional progress.
What does this all mean for business?
The Accord's implications for business are also somewhat ambiguous. On the positive side, all major countries have committed to introduce and/or strengthen their national climate plans and legislation, which is the key driver for business investment. However, the lack of detail and missing elements in the Accord are unlikely to provide the long-term certainty that many businesses had been seeking from Copenhagen. The shift away from a top-down Kyoto-style approach to a more bottom-up `pledge and review' structure also raises questions about the expansion of an international carbon market and indeed the Kyoto Protocol itself.
Although the Accord explicitly mentions emission targets for Annex I Parties under Kyoto, there is no guarantee that countries such as Canada, Japan or Australia will sign up to a second commitment period ­ especially as they can now join the US in making bottom-up pledges under the Accord. The EU has also stated that there is no point in having one set of rules for one group of developed countries and another set of rules for another group.
If the Accord does herald the end to the Kyoto Protocol (which developing countries unequivocally believe it does not) then this raises additional questions about the future of both the CDM and Joint Implementation mechanisms. The Accord only makes passing reference to market mechanisms, although developed countries are clearly interested in using them. If a second Protocol commitment period does not eventuate as a consequence of the new direction taken by the Accord, then a means to maintain both the CDM and JI mechanism will need to be found under another framework.
Clearly then, the adoption of the Accord throws up a number of uncertainties concerning the flexibility mechanisms that have been the main success stories of the Kyoto Protocol. Countries will need to
7

address these uncertainties as quickly as possible in order to provide certainty to existing carbon markets.
However, the shift to a national-led, bottom-up approach could also be to the benefit of business. If the Accord catalyzes greater immediate domestic action ­ because countries are no longer waiting for an international agreement to be finalized ­ then markets for low-carbon goods and services are likely to grow sooner and faster than would otherwise be the case.
What does this all mean for the UNFCCC process?
As one commentator noted, the US-led Accord has ""changed the geometry of the international climate architecture"".
The difficulty of reaching agreement over the two weeks of the conference, despite the various solutions that were on the table, demonstrated the inadequacies of the UN process. The fact that the Accord was ultimately brokered by the US, China, India, Brazil and South Africa also raised questions about the EU's ability to lead and influence major international negotiations. However, the EU is unlikely to be alone in analyzing the implications of the geopolitical shift evident in Copenhagen.
The major players may now look to the G20 and Major Economies Forum as the vehicles for delivering the objectives of the Accord. While these fora would exclude the vast majority of the world's countries, they would also avoid the procedural difficulties associated with the UNFCCC while still covering the vast majority of the world's emissions. If a way could be found to ensure the interests of smaller countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, were still addressed, then this plurilateral2 approach could well prove to be more effective in addressing climate change.
This would not be a straightforward shift to make, however. There is considerable resistance, in particular from smaller countries, to abandoning a system that establishes representative governance systems and, which guarantees an equal right to speak and to support or block a given outcome. Poorly designed parallel processes that are seen to undermine rather than complement or facilitate more inclusive systems may in themselves become an obstacle to effective global action. Countries must be careful that this does not happen.

Impact and Implications for Key Countries
THE UNITED STATES
Generally, the Copenhagen Accord should have a positive impact on the domestic US process. President Obama demonstrated to his home audience that he was not prepared to give away US economic interests and secured an agreement that included action by all major emerging economies. Many Senators believe that without agreement on emission reduction targets, financing and monitoring at the international level, domestic action to address climate change would be in vain. For the first time, the Copenhagen Accord reached a partial consensus on all three of these issues - which should increase Senators' confidence that if they pass climate legislation, a truly global effort will to follow.
The emission reduction targets proposed by the US in Copenhagen are completely in line with what is being debated in the US Congress. However, President Obama's commitment to contribute to the US$100 billion needed by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries is unprecedented, and will no doubt spark a heated debate in Congress, which must approve any international funding. By committing to a figure that is in line with what is needed, Obama made sure that this debate will start from the right point - challenging Representatives and Senators to re-evaluate their concept of what financing is needed to address this issue on a global scale.
In the meantime, for the US to make good on its commitment to contribute to a US$30 billion Fast Start Fund, President Obama will need to get Congress to approve the US$1.2 billion for this purpose in his 2010 budget, and then get a figure closer to US$3 billion approved for 2011.
For US businesses, while details on things like CDM reform and a new crediting program for REDD did not emerge from Copenhagen, the Accord - combined with the finalization of the EPA's ""endangerment finding"" - provides more certainty that a price on carbon in the US is forthcoming. Copenhagen showed that the US is committed to a global deal and to providing financing to ensure that all parties are a part of that deal.
That said, there is still a long road ahead. And once again, the US Senate holds the balance of power in America's response. Ambitious legislation that enshrines the targets put forward by the White House for 2020 and the deeper cuts contained in current proposals for 2030 will send a clear signal ­ domestically and internationally ­ that the US is truly taking on a leadership role and will cement the progress made in Copenhagen. Together with specific measures to support energy conservation and clean technology, this legislation would unleash the innovative power of US businesses and generate as yet unseen scale to international carbon and clean energy markets. Failure to pass such legislation, though, risks creating a global policy stalemate that may be difficult for the world to resolve.

CHINA
China is likely to be content with the outcome from COP15, but also disappointed with the lack of detailed progress made across the wider negotiating process. Although criticized by some developed countries for undermining the level of ambition in the Copenhagen Accord ­ a charge it has strongly rebutted ­ China has unquestionably established itself as an equal to the US in shaping the post-2012 global climate architecture.
Unlike many other developing countries, China's criterion for success at Copenhagen was based more on maintaining its own core positions than extracting concessions from other Parties. In this regard it largely achieved its objectives.
Before Copenhagen, China faced considerable pressure from developed countries to pledge deeper emissions cuts compared to business-as-usual. However, in the absence of wider ambition (particularly from the majority of developed countries themselves) China's pre-conference commitment to a 40-45% carbon intensity target was not seriously challenged or critiqued and, depending on the evolution of the Chinese economy, may turn out to be a very challenging goal.
Other `successes' for China from Copenhagen include the agreement to continue the two-track negotiation process, and the defense of its core position on the sensitive issue of `MRV' (i.e. ensuring differentiation in MRV'ing for unilateral versus supported mitigation action). The ambiguity of the MRV text, however, leaves room for further disagreement with the US and other developed countries as discussions continue in 2010.
On the sensitive subject of financing, China is likely to be satisfied with the commitment by developed countries to provide both short and long-term funding. Alternative proposals had called for contributions from all countries (LDCs3 excluded). China has indicated a willingness to contribute some level of international financial but, importantly for China, this will be on its own terms and on a voluntary basis.
Perhaps the most influential outcome in the long term, however, will be the emergence of the `BASIC` group of countries and China's de facto leadership of it. Copenhagen effectively marked the end of the `G774+China' negotiating group within international climate negotiations, a fact underlined by the BASIC group's role in drafting the Copenhagen Accord. China's invitation to other BASIC members to meet in late January to coordinate positions is a clear indication of how it wishes to see the international climate architecture evolve.
The Chinese government's position for 2010 climate talks, however, is still to look for a meaningful and constructive global agreement that is based on the two-track negotiating process, basic principles of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, as well as the Bali Action Plan.

10

An early indication of Chinese intentions and ambitions for 2010 will be the January 31st deadline for submissions on national mitigation actions under the Copenhagen Accord. Based on the Premier Wen's speech in Copenhagen, China's commitments are likely to include its 40-45% carbon intensity reduction pledge for 2020 (over 2005 levels); its 15% primary energy supply target from nuclear and renewable energy sources; and a target to increase its forest cover. Commitment to reduce energy intensity, building on the 20% improvement target in China's current 11th Five Year Plan, is also likely to feature.
China has implied that these actions represent a floor, rather than a ceiling, to ambition. From an environmental and political perspective, it will be vital that this is the case. Other major emitters will need to show similar commitment.
The clear signaling in Copenhagen that China is committed to taking these actions unilaterally is encouraging, not least because it underpins growing business confidence that a new, potentially vast market for low-carbon goods and services is set to emerge. Whether these initial commitments will actually result in the kind of emission reductions demanded by the climate science remains to be seen, but the sheer scale of any low-carbon development in China is likely to have repercussions on the speed and cost of new technologies globally. This can only be a good thing.
EUROPEAN UNION
The EU ­ being cautious of the risk of being blamed for having no agreement at all ­ reluctantly endorsed the Accord, which was largely negotiated without it.
There is clear disappointment with the result in Europe, as expressed by Commission President Barroso: ""This was the first experiment in working together, there are important points that have been agreed after all it is an agreement. But the level of agreement is honestly not what we have been hoping for.""
That said, EU Member States seem to be divided in their interpretations of the outcome. The Swedish EU Presidency called the agreement ""a disaster"" while German Chancellor Merkel hailed the outcome as a ""step, albeit a small one towards a global climate change architecture"".
The lack of a timeline to reach a legally binding agreement next year is a major shortcoming for the EU, believing it endangers a timely follow up of the Kyoto Protocol in 2013. However, this is very unlikely to influence the roll out and development of internal EU and Member State climate policies. Climate and energy officials in the UK, for example, have been clear that from a domestic perspective at least it is business-as-usual in Britain.
The big question now is whether the EU will raise its ambition to a unilateral 30% reduction target when Parties communicate their pledges in the annex of the Accord on January 31st. Many economic studies and reports show that meeting this target would require very limited extra domestic effort by the EU. There would also be clear benefits for the EU economy, though there is also opposition to this target in a number of newer Member States and influential business sectors.
11

The timing of the next council meetings is not in favour of the deadline to communicate the pledges. The informal environment minister's council is unlikely to be able to decide this when it meets in late January ; the first Heads of State council meeting is planned for the beginning of February.
The other critical issue that climate ministers and officials will need to address early in 2010 is the EU's international negotiating strategy. The absence of the EU from the final round of negotiations between the US and the BASIC group was a diplomatic failure. It underscored the EU's current inability to match its much vaunted climate leadership and economic weight with real political influence and power.
The EU needs to find ways to regain an effective and influential role in shaping the international climate architecture. A combination of new `carrot and stick' policies and measures is probable. The use of border tax adjustments (i.e. `carbon tariffs), for example, is one possible `stick' that has previously been suggested. This controversial measure continues to have support in certain quarters but faces strong opposition in others.
INDIA
To date the outcome from Copenhagen has received little domestic attention in India as other political events have dominated national headlines. The Copenhagen Accord currently provides little political ammunition for either the government or the opposition parties, minimizing the level of parliamentary debate.
India, however, is likely to be satisfied with the overall outcome from Copenhagen, despite having expressed disappointment with the level of ambition actually achieved. The Copenhagen Accord does not compromise on any of India's fundamental negotiating positions ­ for example, its opposition to binding emission reduction commitments for developing countries, and its stringent support for the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol. Furthermore, as a member of the BASIC group of countries, India has firmly established itself as one of the major players in the new political order, at least on climate change.
The agreement to a 2oC temperature target and the absence of any global emission reduction or GHG concentration figures also favors India. In the past India has been anxious to avoid these latter targets, fearing that they could be applied to India in the future. Other areas with good or satisfactory outcomes for India include `REDD plus', financial support, and the flexibility mechanisms (CDM and JI).
Moving into 2010 and beyond, India will be aiming to build on its optimistic expectations from domestic technological innovations plus international technology transfers, as well as the financial support committed by developed countries.
The government has yet to make any announcement on the commitments and action plans it will be submitting by January 31st. The central elements of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, first released in 2008, and including the recently published Solar Mission, will most likely form the basis of any
12

Chairman N. J. Nicholas, Jr. with chairman-elect Carl Ferenbach

I've made my living as a businessman and investor, and that's what got me interested in Environmental Defense Fund. As head of Time Warner, I served in 1991 with Fred Krupp on a presidential commission, where I witnessed firsthand the businesslike approach EDF brings to the table in creating fair and equitable solutions to environmental problems. EDF wins lasting results thanks to a bipartisan approach, the use of economic incentives, and partnerships with diverse, often unexpected, allies from the private sector.
In these times, there is no better investment than a contribution to Environmental Defense Fund. We have shown how helping the environment and helping the economy can, in fact, be mutually beneficial. Our strategy of emphasizing clean and secure energy, job creation and a healthy environment is just the prescription our country and our world need today.
I am delighted to welcome my colleague and fellow trustee, Carl Ferenbach, who will become EDF's chairman in May 2009, and I congratulate the staff on their remarkable accomplishments during my seven years as chairman. My heartfelt thanks to all our members and friends who, despite a difficult economy, were more generous with their contributions this year than ever before, making possible the impressive results you'll read about in the following pages.

THE POWER OF INVENTION

People ask why I'm hopeful despite global warming and the deep recession. I'm hopeful because President-elect Obama has called for a cap-and-trade plan to kick-start economic renewal and achieve reductions in global warming pollution at low cost. His initiative will face a tough battle in Congress, and we'll put our energies into getting it done.
I'm also hopeful because of people like Conrad Burke, Bernie Karl and Jack Newman. These and other inventors are finding new ways to tap energy from the Earth, the seas, the sun--even from yeast. New technologies give us power to solve global warming by cutting carbon dioxide emissions and helping countries like China and India do the same. Washington must unleash this new energy economy--and the jobs that come with it--by enacting a declining cap on carbon, a cap that will send companies knocking on inventors' doors.
Environmental Defense Fund has achieved major gains this year in our four focus areas of climate, oceans, ecosystems and health, and executive director David Yarnold and staff have set out ambitious goals for the coming year. The new president and Congress will face daunting challenges in 2009. That's why we are integrating our strategies for environmental protection into the need to revive the economy.
As Oberlin professor David Orr puts it, ""Hope is a verb with its sleeves rolled up. Hopeful people are actively engaged in defying or changing the odds."" EDF has hope for the future and, with your help, we are on track to achieve major successes in the year ahead.

MAKING GREEN THE NEW BUSINESS AS USUAL

Our unique approach attracts powerful allies

""Significant"" and ""surprising"" -- that's what Fortune magazine had to say about our new partnership with private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). For Environmental Defense Fund, it represented the next step in our nearly 20-year history of uncommon partnerships.
EDF brings about lasting change not through confrontation but through constructive engagement with powerful market leaders. The environmental innovations we develop together can transform entire industries while improving profits.
We first worked with KKR in 2007 when we were invited to help draft the terms of the largest buyout in corporate history, the $45 billion acquisition of Texas electric utility TXU. We in-

sisted on addressing global warming, which led the company to cancel its plans to build eight dirty coal plants. As Thomas Friedman wrote in The New York Times, ""Every college activist should study this story.""
In 2008, we took the partnership a giant step further. KKR sought our help to measure and improve environmental performance at key companies in its portfolio. It's the first time a nonprofit group is helping to green the portfolio of a private equity firm. The analytic tools we're developing will enable managers at companies like Toys ""R"" Us and U.S. Foodservice to assess and track improvements. We'll share the innovations with others to drive industrywide change.

""Business-nonprofit partnerships are especially relevant today,"" says Bob Langert, McDonald's vice president for corporate social responsibility and one of our first partners. ""We need to seek out experts like EDF. We simply don't know enough ourselves.""
To spur change beyond our own partnerships, we assembled a team of experts to identify new green business practices for Innovations Review, a report on advances that are saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The 20 innovations range from large-scale telecommuting programs, which reduce business travel, to power purchase agreements, which let companies install solar power with no upfront capital costs.

At the Innovations Review launch in our San Francisco office, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger praised the initiative: ""EDF recognized that `business as usual' was changing,"" he told a roomful of CEOs. ""And they created a new way to assess environmental innovation.""

WAL-MART STEPS FORWARD ON SOLAR POWER

New alliance with EDF focuses on next-generation technology

In 2008, the world's largest retailer introduced its biggest product ever: the Sun.
Wal-Mart began installing solar panels to generate electricity at up to

22 of its sites, another step toward its ambitious renewable energy goal.
Although Environmental Defense Fund has worked with Wal-Mart for years, our joint efforts really took

off when we opened an office by the company's Bentonville, AR, headquarters in 2006 -- the only environmental group to do so.
Since then, our team has been in ongoing conversations with Wal-Mart decision makers.
For solar power, we're helping WalMart expand beyond conventional rigid panels. These are expensive and problematic in Northern states where many store roofs cannot handle the combined weight of solar panels and snow.
That got Wal-Mart interested in next-generation solar cells incorporated into flexible thin films, roofing materials or windows.
Flexible thin films can convert sunlight into electricity without the disadvantages of heavy solar panels.

We've jointly issued a challenge to solar suppliers for projects assessing innovative solar technologies at WalMart sites around the country. Says our project manager Michelle Harvey: ""Our goal is to shorten the time required to make the best new solar ideas commercially available.""
EDF is the sole environmental partner working with the retailer to accelerate the commercialization of more affordable and better solar technology.
Empowered by Wal-Mart's scale and commitment to sustainability and EDF's expertise in alternative energy, our partnership stands ready to guide a promising innovation from drawing board to reality.

FEDEX HYBRID ELECTRIC TRUCK

SPARKS A TRANSFORMATION

Consistently, the partnerships that Environmental Defense Fund builds with market leaders produce results that ripple through a whole business sector.
For example, aiming to transform the market for the 500,000 fuel-hungry midsize trucks that deliver America's goods, we first sought out an industry leader, FedEx Express. Together with FedEx and Eaton Corporation, we developed the world's first commercially successful hybrid delivery truck. It emits 96% less soot and 65% less smog-forming pollution, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 33% -- and goes approximately 50% farther on a gallon of fuel, so over time the improvements pay for themselves.

Today, the clean truck market has grown to 75 fleets including Coca-Cola and Purolator. The ""Big Four"" truck makers (Freightliner, International, Paccar and Volvo) are moving swiftly to meet rising demand for hybrid trucks of all sizes.
Thirty-seven models are now available, with more in the works. The transformation of the midsize truck market clearly is underway.
As FedEx Express president David Bronzek puts it: ""The environmental and business gains signal a revolution in truck technology and have set a new industry standard ­ thanks to Environmental Defense Fund.""

We help launch the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), a coalition of nonprofit groups and 26 major companies from Alcoa to Xerox, all calling on Congress to cap global warming pollution.

MOMENTUM BUILDS FOR U.S.

ACTION ON GLOBAL WARMING

""I did it for my children."" That's how Florida's Republican Senator Mel Martinez described his June 2008 vote to advance debate on the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act. Martinez was joined by Max Baucus (D-MT) and nine other senators who previously had voted against a similar measure.
The surge in support, brought on with help from Environmental Defense Fund, set the stage for passage of a national climate bill in 2009. ""The economic downturn doesn't diminish the urgency for climate legislation,"" says our national climate campaign director Steve Cochran. ""Congress is finally debating the details of legislation and its impact on utility bills and jobs. We

need to build the infrastructure for a new energy economy.""
In Montana, Senator Baucus backed climate action after we persuaded the Montana Grain Growers Association to support it.
And in Martinez's home state, we produced scientific research on Florida's vulnerability to climate change and rising seas. To draw attention to solutions, we even sponsored the first fishing tournament ever to offset all its global warming pollution. In the end, Florida senators voted to move the Lieberman-Warner bill forward.
When special interests mounted a multimillion-dollar campaign to spread fear about the cost of climate action, we countered with sound

science and economics. Our analysis showed that a declining cap on carbon emissions will have negligible impact on long-term economic growth, while helping to end our oil addiction.
With jobs taking center stage, we teamed up with Duke University to produce case studies of job creation. Many of the brick and mortar jobs for new energy technologies will be in America's manufacturing heartland, where hundreds of companies already are benefiting from the business of renewable energy and energy efficiency. For example, wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa has retooled a steel plant in Ebensburg, PA, creating nearly 1,000 manufacturing jobs.
Bolstering our case, 26 Fortune 500 companies joined USCAP, an alliance we helped launch that calls for a national carbon cap. Member companies represent virtually every sector of the economy and operate in all 50 states.
By showing how climate legislation can help stimulate the economy, we kept the issue high on the political agenda. Now we will hold President Obama and members of Congress to their campaign pledges to cap global warming pollution.

Unrelenting pressure by EDF and its allies has brought America to the threshold of climate action.

COAL'S DAY OF RECKONING
With roughly half of U.S. electricity coming from coal, Environmental Defense Fund has set out to make coal cleaner and promote sustainable alternatives. Some 73 proposed coal-fired power plants in 31 states have been canceled or delayed in the last two years, thanks in part to our work.
In Colorado, our staff and allies worked with Xcel Energy on a plan to close two aging coal plants, expand energy efficiency and add 1,000 megawatts of wind and solar power. ""Xcel is reducing global warming pollution while providing reliable, low-cost energy in a fast-growing market,"" says our deputy general counsel Vickie Patton.
The turning point came in 2007 when two private equity firms enlisted our help in acquiring the Texas utility TXU. To gain our support, the buyers agreed to scrap plans for eight coal plants and double the company's investment in renewable energy and efficiency.

Building on that success, we negotiated with investment banks, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, to impose new environmental standards on financing for coal plants. The standards are shifting investor focus away from old-style coal plants toward an entire range of low-carbon options, including wind, solar and geothermal.

THE ROAD TO A GLOBAL CLIMATE SOLUTION How we'll help win a lasting agreement

Climate program director Peter Goldmark explains our strategy to help achieve a global agreement at the Copenhagen negotiations in December 2009.
Q: Why is fighting global warming different from other problems?
To solve the global climate crisis, all countries must be engaged. Unlike most pollution problems, there can't be a U.S. solution without China and India. We're in this boat together, rowing against a ticking clock.

Q: What will it take to get developing nations to engage?
Our goal is to get these countries to join the global treaty. Credits for protecting tropical forests, for example, can give poor nations an incentive to stop deforestation.
Such an approach will help break the North-South logjam we've had since Kyoto. Of course, until America leads, other nations will not see any reason to act.
Q: Why is protecting rainforests so important?
The burning of tropical forests causes 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and previous treaties did nothing about it.

Now allies in Brazil have proposed a plan that would award credits in the global carbon market to nations that reduce deforestation. Our staff helped advance that plan at recent climate talks. They and other scientists showed how reduced deforestation can be verified accurately using satellite-based radar sensors.
Carbon credits will give tropical forests the value they need to survive. Without them, nearly half the Amazon could be gone by 2050.
Q: How can we help both the climate and the world's poor?
As the economies of countries like India expand, they face a choice whether to grow with dirty energy sources or healthier alternatives.
To promote the better choice, we have partnered with E+Co, a nonprofit investment group, and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Grameen has built a factory there to manufacture

methane-based biodigesters for homes, replacing smoky cooking fires with clean gas stoves.
Early steps in this project already have begun lowering carbon emissions, generating emission credits that help offset the project's cost.
Q: Is there a nexus between energy, economic development and climate?
Absolutely. The desire for a higher standard of living is part of the human condition. The path toward climate stability and the path out of poverty have to be the same.

AS CHINA GOES,

SO GOES THE WORLD

China is roaring into the 21st century with the force of a locomotive, its economy doubling every six years. But the miracle has come at a high price: fouled air, despoiled rivers and a growing share of the world's global warming pollution.
Environmental Defense Fund recognized the challenges and opportunities early. More than 15 years ago, we engaged in what our chief economist Dr. Daniel Dudek calls ""the world's biggest environmental experiment."" We initiated projects using economic incentives to cut power plant pollution in several of China's cities and provinces. The areas covered by our programs now encompass one-third of China's sulfur dioxide emissions.

When a major chemical spill fouled the Songhua River in 2005, the Chinese government turned to us to help develop an emergency response system for environmental accidents. We then offered recommendations on environmental governance to better hold polluters accountable.
Now we are helping China tackle carbon dioxide. Last year, China became the world's leading greenhouse gas polluter. Working with us, the China Beijing Equity Exchange this year established an environmental commodities exchange and a registry to track emissions reductions.
Since much of China's pollution comes from factories that export goods, we launched a Green China Supply Chain Initiative. The goal is

to use the purchasing power of global retailers like Wal-Mart to improve product safety and make complying with Chinese environmental laws a requirement for contracts. Wal-Mart alone has 30,000 suppliers in China. Working with us, the retailer set a goal for its top suppliers to cut their energy use 20% by 2012.

Following recommendations of a panel co-chaired by Dudek, Premier Wen Jiabao created the Ministry of Environmental Protection, a cabinet level post. ""We're seeing in China a revolution in environmental thought,"" says Dudek. ""We need to do everything we can to make it actually happen.""

`CATCH SHARES' GIVE FISHERIES

NEW HOPE FOR THE FUTURE

When John Steinbeck wrote Cannery Row in 1945, California's coastline was dotted with thriving fishing communities. Today, the state's fishing industry faces hard times, with working waterfronts giving way to T-shirt shops. The commercial catch has declined 70%, and similar failures are happening all over the world.
The old style of fisheries management ­ using tactics like ever-shorter fishing seasons ­ has failed to end overfishing and led to a dangerous ""race for fish."" Particularly hard hit was the West Coast's largest fishery ­ the 80 bottom-dwelling species collectively known as groundfish. In 2000, the fishery was declared a federal disaster.

Environmental Defense Fund offered a different approach. We helped persuade the Pacific Fishery Management Council to approve a plan to revive groundfish using ""catch shares.""
Under this system, each trawler is assigned a percentage of the scientifically determined total allowable annual catch. Captains can fish sensibly to maximize the value of their take, rather than racing to catch fish as quickly as possible. That will give them the flexibility to avoid sensitive areas and reduce the accidental killing of other species. The plan, which we helped develop, also calls for observers on boats, eliminating the guesswork and lack of enforcement that have long plagued fisheries.

""As the fishery recovers, each catch share becomes more valuable, giving fishermen a long-term financial stake in the health of the system,"" explains our Pacific Coast Oceans program director Johanna Thomas.
To provide fishermen the dollars they need to switch to sustainable fishing practices, we launched a revolving loan program called the California Fisheries Fund. The fund also will build markets for higher quality seafood products.
Our goal is to make catch shares the standard cure for ailing U.S. fisheries. In the Gulf of Mexico, the success of our catch share program for red snapper has led to its proposed expansion to include grouper. Now we are promoting catch shares for Gulf shrimp and New England scallops, and we're exploring similar programs with recreational fishermen.

Brian Mose, a trawl fisherman in British Columbia, is hopeful. ""Without EDF, I don't think the fishing community would have learned about the science and economics of this great idea.""

HEALTHIER FARMED SEAFOOD

Responding to a wave of consumer demand for healthy and sustainable seafood, leading natural foods retailer Whole Foods this year instituted strict new standards for farmed fish. Since roughly half the seafood consumed in the U.S. comes from fish farms, the standards could have a huge impact.
The new guidelines, developed with help from Environmental Defense Fund experts, ban the use of preservatives, antibiotics, hormones and other chemicals that can be harmful to humans yet

are typically used to promote growth in fish. The policy also avoids fish farmed in wetlands and limits the use of wild fish as feed.

Advancing ocean science with university partners
A few years ago, nobody was talking about mining the deep oceans ­ except the mining industry. Dr. Rod Fujita co-authored a paper in Science in 2007 raising concerns that ocean mining could become commercialized within five years, with or without needed protections. That spurred efforts in Papua New Guinea to ensure that attempts to mine deep sea vents do not damage these unique and valuable ecosystems.
Fujita's efforts are part of our Ocean Innovations initiative to advance ocean science. We're collaborating with Princeton, Stanford and UCBerkeley on projects such as the future of ocean energy and an incentive-based plan to protect the Arctic Ocean as the climate warms.

Cuba: Creating a model for coastal conservation
Operating under a special license from the U.S. government, we are helping Cuban experts lay a legal and policy foundation for conservation as the island's tourism and mining industries expand. Our efforts have led to a network of marine protected areas, safeguarding gems such as the Gardens of the Queen, once Fidel Castro's favorite spearfishing spot.
We also co-authored a handbook that planners in Cuba are now using to ensure that coastal development does not damage mangroves, wetlands and other sensitive environments.

National treasure: Marine monuments in the Pacific
The Central Pacific Islands contain the most pristine shallow-water coral reefs in the world. Farther west, the Mariana Trench is an ocean canyon so deep it could hold Mt. Everest.
In 2008, President Bush set into motion a plan to protect these two unique habitats as national marine monuments. We had proposed monument status for the Central Pacific Islands and built key political and scientific support for restricting fishing and mining.
Together, the reserves will make up the largest protected area on Earth. They build on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands marine monument, which we helped create in 2006. ""With IndoPacific corals disappearing twice as fast as tropical rainforests, these protections truly matter,"" says EDF Oceans program managing director Diane Regas.

GETTING THE RULES RIGHT

EDF helps pass the National Environmental Policy Act, establishing new provisions to protect the environment and creating the Council on Environmental Quality.

Our study of Mississippi River water leads to passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act, setting the first comprehensive national health standards for water.

Proposition 65, a landmark consumer information law drafted by EDF, passes in California and leads many manufacturers to remove toxic ingredients from products nationwide.

The Clean Air Act incorporates our incentive-based program to cut acid rain that was harming lakes and forests. The law reduces sulfur dioxide pollution faster than expected, at a fraction of the predicted cost.

20 For Fiscal Year 2008, our Legislative Action work is included primarily in the Climate line of our financial statement, as well as in the Health, Ecosystems and Oceans lines.

ACTION FUND: MAKING OUR

VOICE HEARD ON CAPITOL HILL

Major opponents of global warming legislation spend $1 million a day lobbying on Capitol Hill. But the environment is making itself heard too.
EDF has long been a powerful voice in Washington, and when the need began to exceed the $1 million annual cap on our lobbying established by tax law, we created a sister group, the Environmental Defense Action Fund, which is free of spending limits. This has enabled us to ratchet up our legislative efforts, particularly on climate, and to advocate strong environmental laws even as the stakes increase.
Non-tax-deductible gifts to the Action Fund allow us to target key legislators and mount ad campaigns that mention legislation directly. In California, for example, our pivotal

intervention helped win the first statewide cap on global warming pollution. We played a key role in drafting the bill and were one of two environmental cosponsors, along with NRDC.
To deliver our message more forcefully, we have assembled a network of influential supporters, the EDF Strategic Partners. These allies -- including local and national civic and religious leaders, economists and CEOs -- contact legislators personally and explain our solutions.
Now, with Congress beginning to debate climate legislation in earnest, our Strategic Partners have quickly gained a high profile, helping to bring 30 U.S. senators and representatives to hear our views on the need for a nationwide carbon cap. We also placed

TV ads in 28 states to help sway wavering legislators. Our message: climate action will be a stimulus for jobs and economic growth.
""Strategic Partners helped us reach labor unions and other key groups,"" says our climate expert Melissa Carey.
Our Strategic Partners have been active on other fronts as well. We brought 50 farmers and ranchers to Washington to urge increased conservation funding in the Farm Bill. Our efforts paid off in 2008 when we helped secure new funding to restore wetlands, preserve habitat and curb agricultural runoff. We also succeeded in getting environmental advocates appointed to fishery management councils across the country.
""The goal is for Strategic Partners to become a consistent presence in the lives of decision makers,"" says Wendy Sommer, the program's director.

North Carolina passes its Clean Smokestacks Act, modeled after our plan to require coal-fired power plants to cut smog-causing emissions 75%.

We help win clean-car legislation in Connecticut and New Jersey to reduce global warming pollution from vehicles.

Our efforts strengthen the Magnuson-Stevens law to help end overfishing. The same year, we help draft and pass California's cap on global warming pollution.

Our broad left-right coalition secures $4 billion in the Farm Bill to help farmers, ranchers and foresters improve conservation on their land.
ECOSYSTEMS
WHY WE WORK ""Habitat loss on private lands is the ON WILDLIFE greatest threat to clean water and
biodiversity. Through incentives, we are making conservation pay for landowners.""
Robert Bonnie VP Land Conservation and Wildlife
""Safe Harbor is a breath of fresh air -- the first concerted effort to work with landowners by a national organization I've seen.""

HOW WE MAKE PEACE BETWEEN

LANDOWNERS AND WILDLIFE

""Every year we would go out and listen for the birds: nothing. This year, suddenly birdsong was everywhere."" That's how Environmental Defense Fund ecologist David Wolfe described his thrilling encounter with endangered black-capped vireos on Kerry Russell's ranch in central Texas this spring.
Russell has worked with us to restore habitat for the tiny songbird on his 130-acre ranch, which sits just beyond the reach of Austin sprawl. He participates in Safe Harbor, our program that encourages landowners to protect species without incurring additional federal restrictions as a result of their efforts. EDF conceived Safe Harbor and convinced the U.S. government to use it broadly.

Before Safe Harbor, landowners sometimes destroyed valuable habitat to avoid federal regulations. Today, the owners of more than four million acres nationwide are welcoming endangered species under Safe Harbor agreements. Groups ranging from The Nature Conservancy to local government agencies have turned to Safe Harbor as a prime tool to save endangered species. ""We've learned we can be more effective by being flexible and listening to landowner concerns,"" says Wolfe.
In Texas, dozens of ranchers signed on to Safe Harbor and today their efforts are paying off: Vireos are nesting in restored habitat from which they've been absent for decades. ""Many ranchers may not call themselves conservationists,"" says Russell, ""but I believe our love for the land makes us natural allies with those wanting to leave a positive legacy for future generations.""
Now, conservation-minded landowners also can get federal tax relief. A provision we won in the recent Farm Bill gives them a tax deduction for money they spend preserving rare ecosystems. The measure garnered support from across the political spectrum -- from the American Farm Bureau to the Sierra Club.
""Farmers, ranchers and forest landowners manage two-thirds of America's land, so they are critical to protecting wildlife,"" says our wildlife attorney Michael Bean. ""They deserve help for doing the right thing.""

We convinced the cities to withdraw from the case and helped an Indian tribe defend the river's renewal. Now, restored spawning beds allow endangered salmon to spawn, and increased river flows help their migration to the Pacific Ocean.

PROTECTING AMERICA'S SPECIAL RIVERS We are working to restore
river flows and native riverbank habitat that is vital to clean water and biodiversity.

""Environmental Defense Fund has played a pivotal role in highlighting the health risks of diesel pollution.""
John Kirkwood Former president, American Lung Association

THE END OF THE LINE FOR

DIRTY DIESEL ENGINES

A container ship the length of three football fields docks at the Port of Los Angeles, where it unloads sneakers, DVD players and a giant plume of black exhaust.
While cars have been subjected to tough pollution limits for more than 30 years, standards for diesel trucks, buses, ships and other diesel engines have lagged behind. A decade ago, Environmental Defense Fund set out to reduce the health threat caused by these under-regulated sources of pollution.
Oceangoing vessels, including cruise ships and container ships, are among the worst offenders, emitting huge amounts of diesel particulates and smog-forming emissions. Ships in the Los Angeles Basin alone pollute as

much as 11 million new cars. Small particles lodge deep in people's lungs and have been linked to cancer and premature death.
In a major breakthrough, international standards adopted in 2008 will cut diesel pollution from new oceangoing vessels by 80 to 90%. We played a pivotal role, helping Congress pass legislation earlier in the year allowing the United States to join the international treaty requiring the cleanup.
Our attorney Janea Scott worked closely with EPA, other environmental and health advocates and state and port officials to bring the bill to the top of the pile in the Senate. Concerted outreach by EDF -- including 9,400 messages from our Action

Network members -- helped win bipartisan support for the legislation.
The victory complements new EPA rules, which we also helped win in 2008, that cut soot and smog-forming pollution from diesel barges, ferries and trains. Collectively, the standards will prevent tens of thousands of deaths and hospitalizations each year.
Back in 2000, Scott was often the lone environmentalist among indus-

try representatives on an EPA diesel advisory panel. But we found allies, demonstrated the health risks of diesel pollution, built support in industry and, when necessary, took EPA to court.
The result? A series of victories cutting pollution from more and more types of diesel equipment. Says Scott: ""Our children should grow up in a world where diesel engines no longer churn out black plumes of smoke.""

NANOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS ARE ALREADY HERE More than 600 consumer items are known to contain nano materials.
PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
""Imagine being able to predict and avoid the catastrophic downside of modern `miracles' like PCBs, asbestos and leaded gasoline. For nanotechnology, our work with leading companies gives us the chance to get out in front of a promising new technology and get it right the first time.""
John Balbus, M.D., M.P.H. Chief health scientist

ENSURING NANOTECH'S SAFETY

Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, recently made a startling discovery. Certain microscopic ""nanotubes"" now used in a wide variety of consumer products may pose health risks similar to those caused by asbestos.
Touted as a revolution in everything from energy to medicine, the science of the ultra-small is generating new materials and uses at a furious pace, outstripping scientists' understanding of the potential environmental and health risks. For example, a nanoscale substance might be absorbed far more readily into the skin or might pass from the bloodstream into the brain, which larger molecules cannot do.
To address the responsible development of nano-materials, Environmental Defense Fund and DuPont teamed up in 2005 to develop a practical means to assess and reduce the risks. In 2007, we jointly released the Nano Risk Framework, a set of guidelines for companies that want to commercialize nanoscale materials safely.
Within months, our work has been translated into French, Spanish and

ers, all are using it. According to GE, it offers ""a `standard of care' for the nanotechnology industry and beyond."" With major companies poised to adopt the framework, Lloyd's of London is encouraging its members to see that it is used on all the nano projects they insure.
The precautions we have recommended come not a moment too soon. More than 600 consumer products--from golf balls to sunscreen -- already use nanotechnology.
We're working to improve government accountability of nanotech as well. After testimony by our biochemist Dr. Richard Denison, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would significantly increase federal oversight and ensure that the government conducts sufficient research into nano's risks.
As Denison says, ""This research is critical to develop new methods needed to understand how these novel materials interact with biological systems and the environment.""

630,000 U.S. newborns exposed each year to dangerous levels of mercury



Leading the way to cleaner hog farms
North Carolina's ten million hogs generate more waste than the entire human populations of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. Waste lagoons and sprayfields can contaminate aquifers and have been linked to a host of health problems.
Culminating a decade of work by EDF and a coalition called Frontline Farmers, North Carolina became the first state to ban new hog lagoons and is implementing a cost-share program to help farmers switch to cleaner technology that converts waste into fertilizer. We serve on the committee evaluating alternatives.
""EDF brought pioneering common sense to the equation,"" says Chuck Stokes, a fifth-generation hog farmer. A transformed hog industry could serve as a model for improving largescale livestock operations nationwide.

Court overturns weak rule on mercury pollution
When EPA announced a flawed policy for curbing mercury pollution, we teamed up with Earthjustice to file suit along with a coalition of doctors, advocacy organizations and states. We then exposed how EPA was strong-arming states into adopting weaker laws. In a major win for public health, a federal appeals court ruled in our favor.
The government's regulation would have established a cap-and-trade program for mercury pollution from power plants. We opposed cap and trade for mercury because trading could lead to toxic hot spots.
Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that builds up in the body and can harm children's developing brains.

To protect children's health, we worked with the state of Colorado to prove that cutting mercury emissions could be done affordably. Spurred by strong state standards like Colorado's, more than 90 power plants nationwide are installing advanced mercury controls that only recently critics claimed weren't commercially viable.
""States have taken the lead to protect their citizens,"" notes our deputy general counsel Vickie Patton. ""Now EPA needs to follow the law and adopt national mercury standards that will protect every community in America.""

FINANCIAL COMMENTARY

Environmental Defense Fund continued to maintain a strong financial position in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, thanks to the generosity and support of our more than 500,000 members, trustees, major donors, foundations and other contributors. Total program and supporting services expenditures for fiscal 2008 reached $100.9 million, a 37% increase over the previous year.
OPERATING SUPPORT AND REVENUE A record level of operating support and revenue was contributed during fiscal 2008 for use in that and future years. Contributions and membership revenue increased to $69.1 million, representing 51% of the total. Foundation grants totaled $56.0 million, or 41%

of the total. Bequests of $3.6 million accounted for 3% of the total, government and other grants provided 3% and investment income and other revenue accounted for the remaining 2%, for a total of $134.9 million in operating support and revenue for 2008 and future years.
Multiyear gifts and pledges play an important role in enabling us to expand and sustain our work. Our fundraising efforts for fiscal 2008 increased the amount available for future years by $27.9 million.
EXPENSES Program services expenditures of $82.6 million accounted for 82% of total operating expenses in fiscal 2008, with almost all devoted to our priority areas -- climate, oceans, ecosystems

and health. Of the total, 7% was for management and administration, 10% went toward the fundraising needed to generate current income and support for future years, and 1% was spent on the acquisition of new members.
NON-OPERATING ACTIVITIES We began a new initiative for funding conservation loans through the California Fisheries Fund. Overall investment performance during fiscal 2008 was negative.
NET ASSETS Thanks mainly to gifts designated for future periods, total net assets grew $20.5 million to $131.2 million during the fiscal year.

The future rainforest 7
Rainforests contain half the Earth's species and are vital to many life systems. Today, they also hold the key to a global climate treaty.

President Obama's policies present a dramatic opportunity to create jobs and solve global warming. Now Environmental Defense Fund must get Congress to act.

Less than a year ago, candidate Barack Obama promised an about-face in the nation's environmental policies. The economic stimulus bill passed in February, with its intention to slash America's dependence on fossil fuels, represents the government's biggest commitment to environmental protection in years. But major hurdles still lie ahead.

""This is a stunning departure from the past eight years,"" says Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp. ""Between the stimulus bill and the climate legislation taking shape in Congress, we're opening a new chapter in the fight against global warming."" EDF helped shape the final stimulus package, which includes the following:
· $20 billion investment in energy efficiency for buildings
· $17.7 billion for mass transit · Funds for renewable energy research · Rebates for the purchase of greener
appliances
Now we and our allies must win support from Congress for strong climate action. We've enlisted strategic partners in labor

and manufacturing to help show Congress that a cap on global warming pollution will create vibrant industries and jobs.
ADVISING THE ADMINISTRATION
Shortly after the November election, Krupp put our study Manufacturing Climate Solutions into the hands of Obama energy advisor Carol Browner. Her enthusiastic response paid a big dividend. Vice President Joe Biden named Environmental Defense Fund as expert panelist for the opening meeting of his Task Force on Middle Class Families, charged with making green jobs a pathway to a strong middle class.

WHERE WE STAND By Fred Krupp, President
A new deal for the environment

T. Charles Erickson

­­­­­ More Americans now work
in the wind industry than in coal mining.
­­­­­

Franklin Roosevelt launched the New Deal in 1933 to help lift America out of the Great Depression. Most historians agree, however, that it was World War II that really turned things around.
Today, we are fighting another global war--against climate change. President Obama has launched that war in earnest by calling on Congress to enact a cap on carbon emissions. He has appointed a strong environmental team, including long-time EDF board member Dr. Jane Lubchenco as head of NOAA, the primary climate science agency.
Retooling America's energy infrastructure will not only help save the plan-

et, it also could save the economy. How? By creating jobs for people like Mike Gonzer, a plant manager in Michigan recently laid off from the auto industry but now working assembling wind turbines.
In a recent meeting at the White House, Lawrence Summers, Obama's chief economic advisor, told me that the key to economic recovery is to remake the energy sector. He likened government's role to that of a pair of scissors. One blade would be green spending in the Recovery and Reinvest ment Act; the second blade would be a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. Together, they can help us cut our way out of the recession.

Creating a clean future
Technology is on the brink of producing breakthroughs in the fight against global warming. Entrepreneurs are harvesting energy not just from the sun and wind but from ocean waves, grasses and even algae.
That's the message of the New York Times bestseller Earth: The Sequel by EDF president Fred Krupp and Miriam Horn, now in paperback from W. W. Norton. The new
edition updates progress by featured companies and includes vivid illustrations of how cutting-edge technologies like cellulosic ethanol and wave energy actually work.
""Krupp does what might seem impossible--he delivers a global warming book that leaves you feeling hopeful."" ­Time
""If you are worried that the world is heading toward climate catastrophe, here's a book to lift your spirits."" ­Harvard Business Review

Dealing with economic turmoil and global warming together makes perfect sense: Behind every clean energy technology--from wind turbines and solar cells to carbon capture and advanced lighting--a parts-and-labor supply chain runs through the heartland of U.S. manufacturing.
For example, Indiana-based SunRise Solar, a maker of solar-powered attic fans, gets plastic and stainless steel brackets from local plants, motors from Pennsylvania, wire from Illinois and thermostats from California. The fast-growing company has helped keep many other U.S. companies afloat in these rough times.
Strong cap-and-trade climate legislation will rapidly create new markets and millions of new jobs in virtually every sector of the economy. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has vowed to have a climate bill on the floor by Memorial Day. Momentum is also building in the Senate. Congress should do all it can to pass a strong bill, and quickly, in order to have maximum leverage for December's UN climate talks in Copenhagen.
As the legislation moves forward, we will stand guard on Capitol Hill to make sure that no last-minute loopholes are inserted in the dead of night. The future of the planet is at stake.

What about wind pollution?
I worked on a maintenance crew servicing 259 wind turbines in northwest Iowa.
While I believe power produced from wind turbines is a good alternative source, there are some problems: moving the energy produced is not efficient because of inadequate transmission systems; there can be pollutants from operation of the turbines; and there needs to be recycling or cleanup after the useful life of the wind turbines. Roger Skelton, Rembrandt, Iowa
Our renewable energy specialist Colin Meehan comments: We currently have enough transmission capacity in most of the windy states to allow a

significant amount of new wind power to be developed. Passing a national cap on global warming pollution will spur even more renewable energy development, as well as the transmission infrastructure it requires.
However, as you point out, wind farms can create local environmental problems, from leaking oil to serious habitat damage. On the positive side, wind farms create much less local environmental damage than coal, natural gas or nuclear power plants. And much of the material is recyclable. In fact, a small cottage industry is already developing around remanufacturing old wind turbines.
To address these issues, EDF helped found the American Wind Wildlife Institute, a consortium of wind developers and environmental organizations. The institute is working to establish rules and incentives for wind developers to site, build, operate and decommission turbines in an environmentally conscious manner.

Holstein will bring his skills in negotiating difficult water issues to EDF as the head of our Center for Rivers and Deltas. ""Unraveling longstanding conflicts and healing the environment in places like the Colorado River Delta will take creative thinking and an evenhanded approach,"" says Holstein. ""I came to Environmental Defense Fund because it is recognized for both.""

PURCHASING POWER
With EDF's help, Wal-Mart takes green business global

Call it a smart business decision. To satisfy the growing demand for green building materials, a California-based startup called CleanBoard now manufactures drywall in a solar-powered factory, using residue from coal-fired power plants as raw material. Even its paper coating is recycled.
""To achieve our goals, we examined every aspect of our supply chain from the sourcing of raw materials to the transportation of finished goods,"" explains the company's founder, Rod MacGregor.
Imagine if a single retailer could demand such environmental performance from thousands of factories? Environmental Defense Fund set out to help achieve this goal.
The products we buy today are only as green as the energy and materials that go into them--the supply chain. Not long ago, it was common for manufacturers to oversee a product's entire life cycle. Today, that model has been replaced by a vast global supply chain moving products from distant factories to your neighborhood mall.
The environmental costs of this supply chain are immense. For example, U.S. demand for products from China-- $321 billion in 2007--has contributed to China's monumental environmental challenges: fouled air, despoiled rivers and a growing share of the world's global warming emissions.

Wal-Mart wants to green its Chinese supply chain.
A GREENER VISION FOR CHINA
As China's biggest export client, Wal-Mart has taken a special interest in greening China's supply chain and has the clout to make things happen.

LESS CARBON = MORE JOBS

When Jackie Roberts, EDF director of sustainable technologies, began to research how the U.S. job market will benefit from global warming legislation, she didn't expect to deliver her work directly to the vice president of the United States. But that's exactly what happened on February 27, when Roberts and EDF president Fred Krupp met with Vice President Joe Biden and several cabinet officers, including Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis.
Roberts' new website, lesscarbonmorejobs.org, profiles 1,200 companies in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields from Florida to Colorado primed to create new jobs when Congress enacts a cap on global warming pollution.

Valuing forests enough to save them

Frans Lanting

One day in December 2002, Herculano Porto thought the world was coming to an end. Machete in hand, he was clearing brush from the forest floor beneath 150-foot-tall Brazil nut trees in Pará state in the Brazilian Amazon when he saw four men with guns and chainsaws coming through the forest.

Herculano, who makes a precarious living collecting nuts and fishing, gathered his things and paddled back across the Anfrizio River to his home. Gradually, all around him, the forest began to fall.
For the last two decades, similar scenes have been playing out across the Amazon. Each year, ranchers, farmers and loggers have cleared and burned some four million
137unique species
become extinct every day due to tropical deforestation
acres of rainforest--an area nearly the size of New Jersey--releasing massive quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Business as usual, some models predict, could destroy half the Amazon forest by 2050.
On that December day, Herculano didn't challenge the intruders. But over the next two years he defied death threats and teamed up with Environmental Defense Fund partners to help establish an

""extractive reserve."" Inside the reserve, clear-cutting is prohibited but forest dwellers can continue their fishing and nut gathering. In exchange for land rights, education and health care, Herculano and other ribeirinhos, or river folk, agreed to manage the forest sustainably.
""Extractive reserves and indigenous lands, where people on the ground have a direct stake in the forest's survival, offer the best protection for rainforests,"" says our anthropologist Dr. Stephan Schwartzman, who has spent three decades working in the Amazon. Using satellite data, Schwartzman has documented that reserves stop deforestation.
Extractive reserves, indigenous lands and parks now cover nearly 40% of the Amazon. But that leaves huge swaths of forest unprotected. And in practice it has been difficult to protect sparsely populated areas because of pressure from ranchers, illegal clearing and a lack of economic incentives.
When a group of rice farmers recently challenged the existence of the four million acre Raposa Serra do Sol

Indigenous Reserve near the Venezuelan border, EDF funded our partner, the Instituto Socio-ambiental, to bring in an indigenous lawyer from Raposa to argue before Brazil's Supreme Court, the first indigenous attorney to do so. In a significant victory, the court ruled to support the reserve.
A GLOBAL SOLUTION
Still, the clearing and burning of rainforests continues--in Brazil, Indonesia and elsewhere. Worldwide, driven by the profits to be made from tropical hardwoods, soybeans and beef, between 20 and 40 million acres of rainforest are lost annually.
Tropical deforestation not only destroys ecosystems, it produces nearly 20% of the planet's global warming

Remembering CHICO MENDES

Twenty years ago, the legendary union activist Chico Mendes was gunned down by an enraged cattle rancher irked that he'd been denied the right to cut down a tract of Brazilian rainforest.
Mendes' voice may have been silenced, but his legacy lives on. 8 Environmental Defense Fund Solutions

Because Mendes had won international environmental prizes, his murder, unlike the 1,500 or so previous murders for hire in land conflicts in Brazil, became world news.
Illiterate until age 18, Mendes had eked out a living as a rubber tapper, collecting latex from the Amazon's rubber trees. Yet he rose to become Brazil's environmental conscience. He not only organized his fellow tappers into a rural workers' union but also formed them into human barriers whenever cattle ranchers threatened the rainforest that was their livelihood.
In December, on the 20th anniversary of his assassination, EDF anthropologist Dr. Stephan Schwartzman traveled to Brazil to receive the Chico Mendes Prize. The Acre state government recognized 20 people who were important in Mendes' life. ""I was deeply honored to be among them,"" says Schwartzman.
In 1987, Schwartzman had brought Mendes to Washington, DC, to press development banks to curtail loans for Brazil's road-building projects until local people's rights were considered.
Our alliance forced the Brazilian government to change its policies. As part of the Mendes legacy, the extractive reserves he helped create have become a bulwark against deforestation in the Amazon--and a source of hope in solving the world's climate crisis.

Kids who dream in green

THE NEXT WAVE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS IS THE YOUNGEST YET

The popular view that kids raised on TV and the Internet are fated to become passive consumers is contradicted by a new wave of informed environmental activism that reaches all the way down to elementary school.
Jordan Reichgut and Alex Scaperotta were only in third grade when a school screening of Al Gore's documentary about climate change, An Inconvenient Truth, inspired them to become environmental campaigners. The pair, now fifth graders at Cider Mill School in Wilton, CT, launched ""Little People, Big Changes,"" which now has a website and a solid record of accomplishment.
Alex and Jordan regularly team up to talk to student groups and set up informational card tables at supermarkets, libraries and Earth Day celebrations. Largely through their efforts, nearly 200 families in the town of Wilton signed up to pay extra on their utility bills to ensure that renewable energy goes into the regional grid. The signups have earned Wilton a pair of solar panels to be installed at town schools.

The return of flower power: Children are taking pollution into their own hands.

TAKING ACTION LOCALLY
Heeding the slogan,""Think globally. Act locally,"" the boys created an anti-idling campaign to convince motorists to fight climate change (and local air pollution) by not leaving their cars and trucks running.
According to a new Environmental Defense Fund report, Idling Gets You Nowhere, idling cars and trucks in New York

City alone produce 760 tons of smogforming nitrogen oxides every year. That's the equivalent of 3,000 trucks, each driving a million miles. Pollutants from needlessly running engines are associated with a variety of health risks including cancer, asthma and heart disease--and children are especially vulnerable.
""If you're stopped for more than ten seconds, you save fuel by turning off the engine,"" Alex said. ""So we created a slogan, `If you're stopped for more than ten, turn it off and on again.'"" Jordan and Alex created bumper stickers and t-shirts that spread their message all over town. For their efforts they were awarded a Climate Change Leadership Award from Connecticut Governor Jodi Rell.

ADVOCATING GREENER SCHOOL BUSES
Some 1,500 miles away in Austin, TX, another group of fifth graders also zeroed in on unnecessary vehicle idling. Their campaign at Casis Elementary pushed the school to educate parents about the dangers of idling. ""It might not have an impact on the world, but it might have an impact on our neighborhood,"" said fifth-grader Isaac Brown.
Similarly, EDF has been helping youth groups fight for laws to reduce school bus idling. In the Conroe district near Houston, we recruited student volunteers to carry test equipment in their backpacks

CLEANING UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD
The new wave of children's environmental activism cuts across income levels. In 1998 three 14-year-olds in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood founded the Environmental Enforcers as part of UPROSE, a Latino community organization. The group's work includes air monitoring of diesel trucks on the Gowanus Expressway, which bisects their neighborhood.
Joaquin Brito, a 17-year-old volunteer, started out by collecting air samples. In 2007 he testified before a state commission on improving city air quality. Brito plans to study environmental engineering in college this fall. ""Facing our environmental problems is something we have to do for our future,"" he says.
These young people do seem to think more about the future than earlier generations did. Their hope is to set an example. They're planting seeds, and working to ensure that they take firm root.

Going to work to defend the desert

When the Bureau of Land Management designated a section of California's Mojave Desert as the site of a radioactive waste dump, Hannah Bentley, a prominent environmental lawyer, went to work. She joined forces with Native American tribes and environmental groups and together they won protection for the area as critical habitat for the endangered desert tortoise. From that day on, she was able to camp in the desert she had helped protect. It remains one of her proudest achievements.
Bentley goes to work each day on behalf of the planet: preserving endangered species habitat, protecting vulnerable populations from unjust environmental harm and helping frame policy around California's historic global warming act.
Bentley has bolstered her environmental legacy by designating Environmental Defense Fund as a beneficiary of her IRA and 401(k) retirement plans. Gifts through estate plans provide EDF with resources to meet the most serious environmental challenges of the future.
""As an environmental lawyer, I have long realized the importance of talking with all parties,"" she says. ""I like the way EDF takes the big picture view and makes an effort not to alienate key players. With its ability to build bridges, EDF will be needed more than ever in the years ahead.""

Hope for endangered Gulf sea turtles

Sea turtles have been around for at least 110 million years, but today all of them are either endangered or threatened. Off the west coast of Florida, endangered loggerhead turtles have been dying in increasing numbers, accidentally caught up in longline fishing gear. In response, the National Marine Fisheries Service plans to suspend longline fishing. EDF is working hard on a solution to keep fishermen in business while ensuring the steady recovery of turtles and ailing Gulf fisheries.
Currently vessels deploy lines over seven miles long, baited with hundreds of hooks. Our plan is to finance a conversion to fishing gear that does not harm sea turtles.
""We are working closely with both fishermen and regulators,"" says Heather Paffe, director of EDF's Gulf of Mexico Oceans program. ""A small investment will go a long way towards protecting endangered sea life and keeping our coastal businesses viable.""
Protective measures secured by EDF off the Texas coast have allowed Kemp's ridley turtles to rebound locally for a record fifth straight year.
Sea turtles and other marine life also will benefit from our campaign to switch troubled fisheries to ""catch shares."" Under
EDF enlisted fishermen to help save loggerheads. 12 Environmental Defense Fund Solutions

this system, each boat is assigned a percentage of the total allowable catch. Captains can fish sensibly rather than racing to catch fish as quickly as possible. This translates into increased dockside prices while reducing sea turtle entanglements and the inadvertent catching of other fish. Regulators recently approved a catch share for grouper and tilefish in the Gulf.
Paffe is optimistic. ""Experience has shown us that environmental solutions are most successful when they make economic sense,"" she says.

Getting the lead out
Each year, some 400,000 newborns are exposed to dangerous levels of lead.
Lead is a potent neurotoxin, but not until recently were the serious health risks of very low levels of lead established. New studies show that lead levels even lower than EPA's 1978 allowable maximum caused lowered IQ's in children, aggressive behavior in teenagers and car-

diovascular disease in adults. Hence we welcome EPA's deci-
sion to tighten the lead standard tenfold. The new standard, 0.15 micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3), is within the range recommended to EPA by its science advisors. But EPA's own analysis shows that to prevent a measurable decrease in IQ for the most vulnerable children, the lead standard should be set as low as 0.02 g/m3.
EDF has worked to reduce lead exposure since the 1970s, when children's average blood level was seven times higher than today. In 1985, we played a major role in banning lead from gasoline.
""This will help protect children,"" says John Balbus, M.D., director of our Health program. ""But the science justifies an even lower standard.""

Air quality in national parks: Persistence pays off
For park visitors, seeing is believing.
The road toward clean air in America's national parks has been a long one. As far back as 1977, Congress set a goal of cleaning up dirty air in major parks and wilderness areas. But this proved more difficult than expected. After years of delays, 37 states still have not produced the plans required to clear the air near national parks.
EDF, Earthjustice and the National Parks Conservation Association successfully sued EPA to compel action. Now the states have two years to get their plans finished and approved.
The stakes are huge. Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from automobiles, power plants and cement manufacturers stunt plant growth, acidify lakes and worsen smog. They also contribute to haze that reduces visibility in Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Great Smoky Mountains to half or less of what it should be.
""With this victory and a newly energized EPA, we're finally on track to restore clean air to America's national parks,"" said our attorney Kevin Lynch.

CAN WILDLIFE ADAPT TO A WARMING WORLD?

Momtuik-Eastcott/NGS

Scientists are striving to predict how migration will change with global warming and what actions can help wildlife adapt.

You'd be hard-pressed to find two birds more unlike than the golden-cheeked warbler--delicate, private, tiny, and the greater sage-grouse--bulky, ground-dwelling and famously flamboyant in courtship. But for all their differences, the two species face an increasingly common problem: an uncertain future as global warming begins to play havoc with their habitats.

the Ashe-juniper habitat in central Texas. ""Part of the coming challenge will be
anticipating the warbler's response to climate change,"" says Environmental Defense Fund ecologist David Wolfe, who works on habitat in Texas. ""We have to protect land not just where they are now but where they will be.""

A recent Audubon study revealed that more than 300 species of North American birds already are wintering farther north, some hundreds of miles from their former range. This will create varied and unpredictable

challenges. For the sage grouse, climate change could mean a big squeeze as sagebrush habitat is lost in many areas. The warbler's troubles are even trickier, since the species breeds in only one place in the world,

A RECIPE FOR WILDLIFE
Broadening a species' range greatly increases its resilience in times of stress, so Wolfe is working on buffer zones and corridors that will allow for the bird's next moves. Most of this potential habitat is on private land, and local landowners have embraced Wolfe's efforts.
""Ranchers might have once looked at having an endangered species as a liability, but we look at it as an asset,"" says one of those landowners, Jay Wagley, a cattle rancher who leases out land to hunters. ""Habitat that's good for warblers is habitat that's good for most species.""
A thousand miles to the north, this thought is echoed by Margaret Solen Hinson, an Idaho sheep and cattle rancher whose land serves as a gathering spot for courtship rituals of the sage grouse.
""Private lands are the connective tissue for migrating species,"" she says.
That connective tissue has never been more vital. Habitat preservation, never easy, has become even more difficult with habitat a moving target.
""One of the most complicated issues we face today is how to adapt to climate change,"" says EDF chief scientist Dr. Ste-

ven Hamburg. ""We need to create policies that help species survive and make ecosystems more resilient--not just by capping pollution but by removing other stressors.""
The new circumstances require a more active style of habitat management. It will no longer be enough to look back at an area's historic flora and fauna, but to anticipate, through modeling, what will be there next. EDF's Sam Pearsall, who works with estuarine ecosystems in North Carolina's Albemarle Sound, calls this pre-storing habitat, in his case readying freshwater habitats for their brackish future.
""We need to consider that rising seas may transform a terrestrial habitat into a submerged one,"" he says. ""We must actively manage species and habitats or risk losing them.""
Another protective approach is to bolster existing populations of endangered species, since a healthy and diverse population is more likely to withstand the effects of climate change.
THE MARMOT'S SALAD BAR
Keeping populations healthy is complicated by the fact that phenology--nature's clock-- is being thrown out of whack. Consider the marmot. For millions of years marmots would crawl out of their dark winter dens to nibble on the green world outside. Their timing was exquisite, their internal clocks prodded by the warmth of spring.

Endangered Species Act: Science wins

The greater sage-grouse celebrates.

President Obama has restored a key Endangered Species Act provision undone by the Bush administration. The decision reestablishes scientific oversight of federal agencies to protect rare species. EDF wildlife chairman Michael Bean, a leader in safeguarding endangered species law, was present at the announcement.
""The president's action is another indication that science is once again respected in the White House,"" said Bean. ""The Endangered Species Act, like many of the plants and animals it protects, is on its way to recovery.""

A world apart
IN THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, AN OCEAN TREASURE FINDS PROTECTION

Why offsetting is failing the climate and people: the evidence

Foreword

Negotiations to prevent dangerous climate change are moving painfully slowly, despite the science demanding urgent carbon cuts. Developed countries are reluctant to set themselves reduction targets consistent with what the science demands and provide necessary financial flows to developing countries. To compound this failure, they are also seeking to continue and extend the use of offsetting.
This report provides the evidence to show that offsetting does not work and will not work. Offsetting does not lead to promised additional emissions cuts in developing countries; it delays essential structural change in developed-country economies; and it institutionalises the idea of cuts in either the north or the south, when science demands reductions in both.
As importantly, the report reveals the inequalities of the offset approach ­ an approach that allows people in rich countries to carry on polluting while requiring unfair reductions in developing countries.

""Negotiators must recognise that offsetting does not work, will not work and that it must be scrapped.""
Offsetting is now a dangerous distraction. Negotiators must recognise that it does not work, will not work and that it must be scrapped. Instead the world needs developed countries to cut their own emissions first and fast and pay up for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. This course of action is not a threat to the well-being of people in developed countries; it is a vital step towards new jobs, new industries, a healthier global economy and a safer and more just world.

About this report
This report has been prepared for Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland's work on international climate justice. The report is for decision makers, media and campaigners thinking through robust, workable and fair solutions to climate change ahead of the UN talks in Copenhagen in December 2009. There is a growing and credible body of evidence and opinion that offsetting is not working; that it is undermining efforts to prevent dangerous climate change and supporting sustainable development; that it is profoundly unjust, and that it cannot successfully be reformed. This report draws together some of the key evidence to ensure this view is fully reflected in public debate and international talks. It focuses on the UK as an example, but the lessons are applicable to all developed countries.

Executive summary

Tackling climate change urgently requires major cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions. At Kyoto in 1997, as a step towards this goal, developed countries agreed targets to cut their emissions. Embattled negotiators introduced offsetting to offer some flexibility in the way these targets could be met.

The theory was that offsetting would allow developed countries to meet part of their targets by paying developing countries to deliver greenhouse gas reduction projects. Since then offsetting has grown quickly, in particular in the form of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Despite many well-publicised problems1, CDM offsets are now predicted to deliver more than half of the European Union's planned carbon reductions to 2020.

In practice offsetting is having a disastrous impact on the prospects for averting catastrophic climate change. It is vital that the inherent and systemic flaws in the approach are recognised ahead of negotiations. These problems cannot be dealt with by simply reforming CDM; instead completely new approaches are needed that are effective and just.
The five central arguments against offsetting are that it:

Offsetting in general is poised for further expansion, potentially bringing on-stream many more offset credits: · into forests, through proposed
offset-based REDD mechanisms (Reduced Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation). · into sectors that the CDM does not currently cover, such as nuclear power. · under new sectoral frameworks.
Offsetting has gone from being a minor, experimental idea to an approach which, although it has major negative impacts on countries' climate-change strategies, is set to expand further. Countries are clamouring for even more offsetting opportunities as the world prepares for crucial climate talks in Copenhagen at the end of 2009.

1 counts action in developing countries as part of the cuts promised in developed countries, although the science is clear that action is needed in both developed and developing countries.
2 cannot guarantee the same cuts as would have happened without offsetting.
3 is causing major delays to urgently needed economic transformations in developed countries.
4 does not ensure positive sustainable development in, or appropriate financial transfers to, developing countries.
5 is profoundly unjust, fundamentally flawed and cannot be reformed.

For these reasons offsetting must not be expanded at Copenhagen. New proposed offsetting schemes must be dropped from negotiations, and existing offsetting mechanisms need to be scrapped.
This report analyses offsetting, using mainly the example of the largest scheme, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). However, this analysis is largely applicable to the other types of offsetting as well.
Offsetting is not reformable
Offsets are a swap of an emissions cut in developed countries for a cut in developing countries. But action in both is needed. Failure to cut in developed countries also results in delays in essential infrastructure changes necessary for deeper cuts in the future. Offsetting results in fewer emissions cuts. No amount of reform can alter this. The problems of proving ""additionality"" ­ that the developing country project would not have happened without CDM ­ are inherent. The US Government Accountability Office says it is impossible to know with certainty whether a project is additional. The problems of proving the offset project generates the same level of carbon cuts are inherent. Offsetting credits are created against hypothetical baselines ­ they are not and cannot be guarantees of the same level of cuts.

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

The report finds that:
1. Offsetting delivers lower greenhouse gas cuts than the science says are needed to avert catastrophic climate change. The IPCC says that developed countries need to make major greenhouse gas cuts and in addition that developing countries need to make cuts on so-called business-as-usual baselines (emissions levels). But offsetting means that action in developing countries can be counted as part of the action needed in developed countries. Offsetting therefore institutionalises the idea of making cuts in one or the other, when the science and the IPCC are clear that action in both is needed. It is incompatible with the IPCC's recommendation, and leads to less emissions cuts. The climate loses.
2. Offsetting cannot guarantee the same level of carbon cuts in the developing country as would have been made in the developed country. i.It is almost impossible to prove
that most offsetting projects would not have happened without the offset finance ­ ie that they are ""additional"". The US Government Accountability Office's (GAO) 2008 review of offsets said ""it is impossible to know with certainty whether any given project is additional"". Without this guarantee the net effect is that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing ­ because the CDM credit allows the developed country to continue polluting. The climate loses. ii.Even if a project were additional, it is often impossible to calculate accurately how much carbon a project is saving. This is because

credits are calculated by judging action against hypothetical futures ­ things that haven't happened.
3. Offsetting delays necessary infrastructure changes in developed countries. It weakens incentives to implement strong climate policies or prevent high-carbon investments. A switch to a low-carbon model in developed countries in time to prevent catastrophic climate change requires that they make major investments now and over the next 10 years. Yet offsetting means that, for example, EU countries can delay taking strong action until at least 2020. Locking in their high-carbon infrastructure will have severe consequences for the global climate and developed-country economies.
4. Offsetting is not delivering for developing countries. i.In many cases offsetting is not
helping developing countries take a low-carbon path. In fact a large proportion of CDM revenues are subsidising carbon-intensive industries, or projects building fossil-fuel power stations. ii.CDM can create financial incentives for developing countries not to implement strong climate policies. This is because only projects that are not required by regulation are supposed to qualify as CDM projects. iii.The financial flows involved are far lower than those required to adequately or effectively support low-carbon development. Developing countries must be given far greater support ­ not least because of the colossal historic debt owed to them by developed countries, which have overwhelmingly caused the climate

change crisis. Offsetting, however, is not the tool for this job. ivThere are severe equity impacts for developing countries if developed countries offset even part of their targets. Offsetting deepens inequality in per capita carbon consumption between developed and developing countries.
In summary, CDM and other types of offsetting are flawed and highly problematic tools for tackling climate change. They are a dangerous distraction from the urgent business of decarbonising the world's economies. They are not open to reform (see box opposite), and should be scrapped.
Governments should:
1. Agree that developed countries must reduce their own emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2020, excluding offsetting.
2.Reject all forms of offsetting: proposals for new and expanded offsetting schemes must be dropped, and existing offsetting mechanisms need to be scrapped.
3.Reject plans to introduce REDD offsets, and instead negotiate effective and fair mechanisms to protect the Earth's forests that do not involve offsetting.
4.Negotiate a new financial mechanism under the authority of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure adequate financial flows to developing countries to support their transition to a low-carbon future.

Climate change: the scale of the challenge

The need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is desperately urgent. Scientists tell us we are hovering at the edge of dangerous climate change tipping points. Despite the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) -- signed as long ago as 1992 ­ global emissions of GHGs have continued to increase, and have even accelerated since 2000.

All signatories to the UNFCCC (including the United States) have committed to the overall objective of the Convention as stated in article 2 ­ to prevent dangerous climate change. It is accepted that an average global temperature rise of more than 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial times would cause dangerous and
""Climate change is potentially the greatest challenge to global stability and security, and therefore to national security.""
even catastrophic impacts. Exceeding 2 degrees will create water scarcity for billions of people, put billions at risk of hunger, make hundreds of millions homeless because of flooding and threaten the very existence of low-lying island nation states through sea-level rise.

Mitigating the effects of climate change is also increasingly recognised as a security imperative. The UK National Security Strategy states: ""Climate change is potentially the greatest challenge to global stability and security, and therefore to national security.""3
Recent research on climate tipping points, which identifies the temperature rises after which for example the Greenland ice sheet melt is likely to become irreversible, suggests the 2 degrees target is prudent. Maximising the chance of keeping well below 2 degrees is a moral imperative for all humanity.
A synthesis of climate models published in 2006 suggests that a concentration of 450 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) gives a 50 per cent chance of not exceeding 2 degrees. This should be regarded as an absolute maximum concentration: a 50 per cent chance is not good odds when the climate is at stake.
Research by the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research has suggested that to achieve this requires global CO2e emissions to peak in 2015 and fall by 4 per cent a year thereafter. The emissions cuts this trajectory involves should be seen as the minimum required.

The Tyndall research indicates the scale of overall reduction required: which countries will make what proportion of these cuts will be decided in negotiations.
Recent papers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) authors suggest that even 450 ppmv CO2e will require a 25-40 per cent reduction in emissions from developed (Annex I) countries by 2020 and a 15-30 per cent reduction below baseline for developing (nonAnnex I) countries by 2020. The ranges summarised by the IPCC are ""assumed to be achieved domestically by both groups of countries"".
This allocation of responsibility is itself deeply unjust to developing countries, given historic contributions to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions.
Developing countries have called for greater ambition from developed countries in Copenhagen. The G77 and China say ""much deeper reduction commitments are required and [...] must reflect their historical responsibility as well as evolving scientific evidence"". Least developed countries (LDCs) call on developed countries to accept targets of ""at least 40 per ent by 2020""7 and the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) calls for reductions of ""more than 40 per cent"".

2 political context: Why decisions on offsetting are important

Developed countries (those listed in Annex I of the UNFCCC) agreed targets to cut their carbon emissions up until 2012 as part of the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period. There is a legal requirement for developed countries to set further targets for subsequent commitment periods after 2012. The Protocol allows developed countries to use offsetting as a way to meet those targets. The CDM runs to 2012 in its current form, and is set to continue beyond that date with amendments subject to further negotiations. The UNFCCC is deliberating proposed changes to the CDM and considering new offsetting schemes in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate talks in December 2009.

The talks in Copenhagen are a crucial opportunity to forge a stronger global agreement to prevent catastrophic climate change.
It is widely acknowledged that there are many failings with the CDM (see sections 4 and 5): some concerns come from the problems in ensuring additionality or proving carbon reductions; some concerns stem from the fact that poorer developing countries are effectively excluded from any financial transfer through the CDM; and some concerns are about the lack of sustainable development benefits and the harm that some projects cause to local communities.

The focus of the CDM reform discussions, however, is to reduce regulation of the CDM and increase the supply of credits. Other proposals aim to create entirely new offsetting schemes. Consequently, the thrust of negotiations is creating space for even less real action on climate at a time when there must be more.
""Negotiators are clearly indicating that they want to see more of the CDM, not less. Parties to the Kyoto Protocol only recently agreed that the mechanism would continue beyond 2012."" Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, April 200910

The main offsetting proposals on the negotiating table involve:
· moving away from project-based CDM to larger sectoral approaches.
· lifting bans on types of projects that can be included, such as nuclear power.
· extending offsetting to forest carbon trading through REDD mechanisms.
The effect of such an increase in the supply of offset credits would be to further weaken the economic incentive to make real domestic emissions reductions in developed countries and transfer the responsibility of reducing emissions to developing countries, albeit with some financial recompense.
Offsetting has become one of the central parameters that inform developed countries in defining their ambition, with the expectation of avoiding much of the carbon-reduction effort. This abuse of the UNFCCC mechanisms threatens to make a mockery of science-based target setting.

Annex I Parties include the industrialised countries that were members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1992, plus countries with economies in transition (the EIT Parties), including the Russian Federation, the Baltic States, and several Central and Eastern European States.

EU strategy for increasing offsetting · The EU climate and energy
package established a framework to allow more than half of EU emissions reductions responsibility up to 2020 to be offset to developing countries. · The European Commission strategy paper, Towards a Comprehensive Climate Change Agreement in Copenhagen, states that the EU seeks to align policy with other developed countries in ""generating demand for offset credits"". · The EU has also proposed new sectoral offsetting mechanisms for agreement in Copenhagen. Sectoral crediting is intended to allow whole sectors in certain developing countries to generate carbon credits through supposed reductions in their sector's emissions growth. This is in essence an expanded CDM, creating a higher volume of credits than project-based CDM against a hypothetical baseline.

The overall EU strategy is to shift around half of its own emissions reductions responsibility to developing countries through offsetting, thereby avoiding an equivalent domestic effort.
In addition to the offsetting strategy, the EU is also proposing a sectoral trading scheme. This would, for example, set a global cap on emissions from steel manufacture. Steel plants that make greater emissions cuts would be able to sell spare permits to plants that do not have enough permits to cover the pollution they have released.
In practice this scheme is likely to suffer the same problems that continue to bedevil the EU Emissions Trading Scheme: · politicians setting the cap too high,
leading to little or no reduction in emissions. · an excuse for allowing development of more carbon-intensive infrastructure on the premise that cuts will be made elsewhere. · huge windfall profits for polluting industries.

Considering the EU's current proposed reduction target is only 20 per cent by 2020, securing a steady supply of offset credits would effectively halve an already dangerously low ambition and undermine an already weak policy framework. These problems are likely to be exacerbated by EU proposals to allow Member States to bank credits (ie buy credits now and use them later).

3Offsetting: what is it and how significant is it?

Offsetting is the process whereby developed countries pay developing countries to deliver projects that purportedly cut carbon emissions ­ in effect making carbon cuts in developing rather than developed countries.
Offsetting emerged as a smallscale experimental idea agreed by embattled negotiators in the last hours of the Kyoto Protocol talks in 1997. It was intended to give developed countries some flexibility in meeting their targets. Offsetting would be delivered via two mechanisms ­ the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI). Its proponents argued that offsetting would:
· be an economically efficient way of making carbon cuts globally.
· transfer money from richer to poorer countries.
· help with technology transfer and development in poorer countries.

In the subsequent 12 years CDM and other types of offsetting have, despite major and well-publicised problems, become much larger mechanisms. For example, the European Union's climate change strategy allows more than 50 per cent of its planned emissions reductions to 2020 to come from offsetting.
The CDM allows countries with binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol to buy credits from developing countries that do not have Kyoto targets and that are implementing carbon-cutting projects. The credits are given units of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Rules have been established that are intended to ensure genuine emissions reductions ­ although this report shows that they do not work.
The current report draws heavily on the experience of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), for two reasons:
· First, the CDM is the world's biggest and most established regulated offsetting mechanism.
· Second, the CDM ­ and its smaller companion offset mechanism with other developed countries, Joint Implementation (JI) ­ are the only offsets allowed in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS); the latter is the world's largest carbon-trading scheme, accounting for around three-quarters of the value of traded carbon in 2008. A summary of other types of offsetting appears in the table on page 12.

What types of offsetting are there?

CDM is the largest offset mechanism, accounting for more than four in every five tonnes of carbon offsets traded. Table 1 shows the volume of offset carbon traded in 2007.
What project types are there?

There is a variety of different offset project types, such as:

· Sequestration: projects that trap carbon ­ for example forest projects. Only a limited range of forest projects are currently allowed under CDM rules.
· Greenhouse gas destruction: for example capturing nitrous oxide (N2O) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) emitted from factories, and turning them into more benign molecules.
· Energy efficiency: for example fuel switching and upgrades to power plants.
· Energy projects: for example wind, biomass, solar, coal, gas, and hydro-electricity schemes.

Who hosts the projects and who buys the credits?

The four countries predicted to be generating the most CDM credits in 2012 are shown in Table 3. 18


UK companies are the top buyers for CDM projects, according to the official CDM statistics, with more than 1,223 projects. These projects are not necessarily offsetting UK emissions, however, but the UK is the host country for the purchase of the emissions; the credits may be sold on to emitters in other countries. The next biggest buyers are Switzerland (544 projects) and Japan (480). 19 The UK is therefore at the centre of the multibillion-dollar offset market.
The chart below shows the main buyers of offsets.

CDM: how significant is it?

Proportion of EU emissions allowable through offsetting

The use of CDM is growing rapidly and is predicted to account for a significant proportion of overall carbon reduction targets up to 2020. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that 5. billion CDM credits (CERs)* will be issued between 2009 and 2020.
In the EU climate package agreed in December 2008, sectors outside the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EUETS) ­ such as surface transport ­ can meet 73 per cent of their carbon reductions required for 2013-2020 by buying CERs. Some 781 million of the total reduction effort of 1. billion tonnes CO2e can be met by buying CERs (see chart, right).
The EU has committed to reduce its emissions by 20 per cent by 2020; in practice, however, with offsetting it is cutting its own emissions by only 10 per cent.

Sectors in the EUETS can meet 50 per cent of the effort from 2008 to 2020 with CERs, representing 1. billion tonnes CO2e. It is extremely likely that all these credits will be used if available, as CERs are cheaper than EUETS credits (known as EUAs).
The EU has committed to reduce its emissions by 20 per cent by 2020; in practice, however, with offsetting it is cutting its own emissions by only 10 per cent. In summary, the high volume of CERs heavily reduces the effort required of developed countries to reduce their own emissions. Probing the effectiveness of CDM credits is therefore crucial to determining whether offsetting mechanisms are in fact a successful strategy for preventing dangerous climate change.

* CDM credits are called CERs; 1 CER is deemed equivalent to 1 tonne of CO2e

Negative impact on climate

Conclusion

Very high. Prevents emissions Reject cuts in developed countries.

Very high. Improves CDM's sustainable development problems, but still a major brake on developed-country emissions reductions. A distraction.

Reject. More effort is made on sustainable development and additionality than other CDM projects, but basic problems of CDM unresolved.

High. Scheme is small and cap exists in both countries, but the over-allocation of emissions for Eastern European states due to economic contraction in the 1990s reduces impact of real cuts in EU economy as a whole.

Reject. Delays infrastructure changes in country buying offset, creating carbon lock-in.

Very high. Same problems as CDM, but magnified by even more uncertainty over carbon guarantees. Possibly a huge scheme.

Reject. Forests could turn into sources of carbon rather than sinks within 100 years; deforestation shifted rather than prevented; social justice problems.

Very high. Pitched as a reform of CDM, but suffers most of the same problems, and creates potentially far greater get-outs for developed countries.

Reject. Could create regulatory chill; same problems with additionality and guaranteed cuts as CDM.

High. Quality of schemes even lower than CDM. Creates societal 21 pressures and excuse for inaction.

Reject. Even worse quality than CDM.

4 Why offsetting doesn't work

This section outlines three structural reasons why offsetting mechanisms are flawed and unreformable. It also sets out the impacts of relying on offsetting.
4.Less carbon is Cut: REDUCTIONS IN ONE place, not both
The IPCC has said22 that keeping global greenhouse gas concentrations low enough to offer the greatest chance of avoiding dangerous climate change requires major emissions cuts in developed countries in addition to deviation from baselines in developing countries. It estimates that meaningful progress towards preventing dangerous climate change would mean by 2020 a 25-40 per cent cut for developed countries, and a 15-30 per cent reduction on business-as-usual baselines for developing countries. These cuts are likely to be inadequate because, according to research by the UK's Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, the IPCC data on recent emissions were underestimates23, and in practice they are not being delivered ­ for example the EU has only a 20 per cent 2020 target.
Even this inadequate progress is further weakened by the use of offsetting. The IPCC is clear that action is needed in both developed and developing countries. But offsetting means that action in developing countries can be counted as part of the action needed in developed countries. Offsetting

therefore institutionalises the idea of making cuts in one or the other, when the science and the IPCC are clear that action in both is needed. Offsetting is incompatible with the IPCC's recommendations.
The US Government Accounting Office states that carbon offsets are ""inherently uncertain"" and ""involve fundamental tradeoffs and may not be a reliable long-term approach to climate change mitigation"".
The issue of distribution of effort is central to the UNFCCC negotiations. Taking into account the historical emissions and relative wealth of developed countries ­ the basis of the UNFCCC's ""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities"" ­ there is a strong argument that developed countries should take greater emissions cuts than those modeled by the IPCC.
There is a deeply unequal distribution of responsibility for cumulative global greenhouse gas emissions between developed and developing countries. Inadequate commitments from developed countries are an unjust response to that historic responsibility ­ in practice offsetting exacerbates the inequality by further diluting developed-country commitments (see section 5).
CDM is supposed to be a way of making the same levels of carbon cuts as would otherwise happen, but more cost-effectively. At best it shifts a carbon cut in a developed country to one in a developing country. But in practice it does not even do this.

4. Many projects in developing countries would have happened anyway
Before they can be CDM-registered, project proponents have to justify that their scheme would not have happened anyway ­ ie that it is additional. Otherwise, the net effect would be that carbon globally is increasing (as the CDM credit allows the developed country to continue polluting).
In practice there are three reasons why CDM projects cannot be proved to be additional:
i) Schemes are already part of that country's development Some schemes are not additional because they use technology that is widely available, or they are already common practice. In China more than 200 large-scale hydro plants are progressing through CDM validation. They are all claiming that the projects would not have gone ahead without CDM revenues ­ for example, because a coal-fired station would have been cheaper to build. This ignores the fact that the Chinese Government is a strong supporter of hydro-electric development, that hydro is a major component in its five-year plans, and that the Chinese hydro-electric industry is expected to grow from 132-154 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in 2010 to 191-240 GW in 2020 ­ growth equivalent to around 20 large coalfired power stations. Hydro growth in China is continuing at previous trends, and there is no evidence that removing CDM would stop China continuing its strategy of building more dams.

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

13

These hydro stations are already big revenue earners; CDM revenue is a bonus, not the deciding factor. Developers stand to gain many extra millions from applying to CDM, as does the Chinese Government, which taxes CERs.
Lucrative coke oven
A coke oven project in Lingxi is highly economically attractive (saving on electricity costs); many of the steps justifying its claim to be financially unattractive are missing. It had already attracted 70 per cent funding from the China Development Bank before gaining CDM registration. It is difficult to demonstrate that this project would not have happened anyway ­ ie that it is additional.
Other sectors too are looking to offset opportunities to generate extra finance. Indian government officials say India's rapidly expanding sugar industry should seek offset credits, as its ethanol production is displacing petrochemicals. As the industry has expanded at 35 per cent a year for the past five years, this activity cannot be deemed to be additional.
International Rivers states:
""... of 370 Chinese hydropower projects submitted for CDM validation, 77% are expected to start generating within 12 months of their validation comment period...Normally hydropower plants take at least several years to build, confirmed by P[roject] D[esign] D[ocuments] that provide a construction start date. This means that most of the Chinese hydropower projects in the CDM pipeline started construction prior to beginning the CDM

validation process[...] Since construction began well before CDM registration, it is clear that these projects still would go ahead even if they were not successfully registered as CDM projects.""29
Wara and Victor analyse the Chinese hydro, wind and gas sector. They state that the Chinese Government has recently introduced strong policies to support these technologies, to relieve the economic and pollution impacts of heavy reliance on coal in its massive increase in power-generation capacity. They also show that ""essentially all"" new hydro, wind and natural gas fired capacity is applying for CDM credits.
Wara and Victor argue:
""taken individually, these claims may make sense ­ because individually any particular power plant utilizing non-coal sources probably faces greater hurdles than new coal-fired generation [...] taken collectively however, these individual applications for credit amount to a claim that the hydro, wind and natural gas elements of the power sector in China would not be growing at all without help from the CDM. This broader implication is simply implausible in light of the state policies described above.""30
Gansu hydro project
International Rivers cites the example of Xiaogushan, Gansu, hydro project: an Asian Development Bank report into the project in 2003 said it was the cheapest option for expanding generation in Gansu, regardless of CDM revenue, and a priority for the local and provincial government. Yet in 2006, two years after construction

started, the developers claimed that without CDM support it was too risky ""to reach financial closure and [...] commence the project construction"". It was CDM approved in August 2006.
The US GAO says assessing additionality will become more complex ""as host countries begin to factor the CDM into their planning efforts and it becomes more difficult to identify what would have happened without the program"".
ii)Proofs of financial viability are thin To get CDM support projects have to prove that without CDM revenues they would not be financially viable. The usual method for doing is this is to show that the project generates a lower Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than is standard for projects in the region, and a higher IRR with the CDM revenues. But there are wide discrepancies in how different projects clear this hurdle.
For example, India's Tanjavur natural gas power plant claims that the IRR without CDM is 15. per cent, stating that ""all power projects in India are considered viable only if the guaranteed returns of 16% on the capital are ensured"". This project was registered on 29 May 2007. Yet the Kalyani Steels electricity generation project registered on 29 September 2006 states: ""In the Indian power sector a 16% return on equity has been an established benchmark for a long time [...] this has recently been revised downwards to 14% by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission."" 33
If the Tanjavur project had used 14 per cent it would have not needed the CDM revenues to clear the IRR benchmark. Tanjavur is not

14

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

an additional project. It has been widely reported that
hydro-power developers routinely underestimate the amount of power their dams will generate, which has the effect of reducing projected revenue streams, making such projects appear less financially attractive without CDM revenues. International Rivers argues that a typical hydro-power
86 per cent of them agreed that ""in many cases, carbon revenues are the icing on the cake, but are not decisive for the investment decision"".
load factor34 is around 50 per cent. But citing Michaelowa International Rivers says that as of 1 March 2008 the CDM project pipeline contained 82 hydro plants in China with a load factor below 40 per cent and seven with a load factor below 30 per cent.
These are not isolated examples. Analysis by Haya36 suggests that three-quarters of registered CDM projects were already complete at the time of approval. Developers counter that expectation of CER revenues was critical for the decision to go ahead with the project. Such a claim is not provable in most cases. Indeed, a survey of CDM professionals found that 71 per cent agreed that ""many CDM projects would also be implemented without registration under the CDM""; and found 86 per cent of them agreed that ""in many cases, carbon revenues are the icing on the cake, but are not decisive for the investment decision"".
An Asian Development Bank senior official said in 2008:
""When the CDM was introduced 10 years ago, there was much

expectation from the developing countries that it would provide the necessary upfront financial and technical support for new sustainable development projects that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Today [. . .] it is mostly functioning to provide additional cash flow to projects that are already able to move forward with its [sic] own financing.""38
The US GAO's recent review of the CDM and interviews with CDM participants found:
""Several representatives from the cement and auto industries said they would pursue clean energy projects regardless of the CDM, describing the CDM credits as more of a `bonus' than a driver of investment.""39
iii)Exaggerated claims There are structural reasons in the design of CDM approval that mean carbon benefits are likely to be exaggerated, additionality claims abused, and sustainable development problems ignored.
Wara and Victor write:
""The host governments and investors that seek credit have a strong incentive to claim that their efforts are truly additional. The regulator ­ in this case, the CDM Executive Board ­ can't in many cases gather enough information to evaluate these claims. These problems of asymmetrical information are compounded in the CDM, to be sure, because the CDM Executive Board is massively under-staffed and the CDM system relies on third-party

verifiers to check the claims made by project proponents. In practice, these verifiers, who are paid by the project developers, have strong incentives to approve the projects they check. Further, there is scant oversight on the integrity of the verification process and no record of punishing verifiers for misconduct. Lacking any other source of information about individual projects and facing pressure from both developing and developed country governments, the CDM Executive Board is prone to approve projects. Asymmetries of information are rampant; the incentives mostly align in favor of approval.
""This challenge is made all the more formidable by the sheer number of projects upon which the Board must decide. The CDM EB, on average, registers about one project every day as eligible to generate CDM credits. Thus the Board cannot afford to spend large amounts of time evaluating the complexities of financial data presented to justify a project's eligibility for CDM credits nor can it delve into a project's relationship to state energy policy. Furthermore, the CDM EB faces a financial limit on the costs it can reasonably impose on individual offset projects. In order to remain viable, relatively small carbon offset projects cannot afford the cost and uncertainty that would accompany truly extensive scrutiny. Indeed, there is strong pressure from CDM investors to limit such transaction costs and speed up approval.""41

4.No guarantees of emissions cuts
CDM projects cannot guarantee carbon cuts, and often exaggerate claims about the amount they will cut. This is an inherent problem. Any system of credits for reductions against a hypothetical business-as-usual scenario, is inherently prone to questionable claims of certainty.
The US GAO reports that
""the use of carbon offsets in a cap-and-trade system can undermine the system's integrity, given that it is not possible to ensure that every credit represents a real, measurable, and long-term reduction in emissions"".
Because offset cuts are created against a hypothetical business-as-usual baseline, it is impossible to ensure that offset credits guarantee carbon cuts. Not only can it not guarantee carbon cuts, in some cases it can increase them.

Tanjavur Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant, Tamil Nadu, India
Registered in May 2007, this project claims to reduce carbon emissions by 180,000 tonnes by being cleaner than existing power plants in the region, displacing dirtier power from the grid. Although it is cleaner, it is still a new fossil-fuel power station, average by western standards. In this case CDM is helping India to copy and lock in to a high fossil-fuel, western development path, rather than take a low-carbon path. Developing countries need to bypass this western stage of development, not mirror it. In addition, the plant is not displacing dirty power plant; it is an additional plant to meet increasing electricity demand in the region. Claims that the project will result in overall lower emissions from the region are refuted in the project's design document itself which states that a benefit of the project is that it will ""make coal available for other important applications"".

New coal-fired power stations
In September 2007 the CDM board ruled that super-critical coal-combustion plants could receive CERs. This is more efficient than older technology, but is still highly carbon-intensive (produces high levels of carbon per unit of electricity generated). It is not particularly new or expensive technology that requires CDM help. Even by 2004, over half of orders for new coal plants in China were for the super-critical type. The International Finance Corporation is supporting the development of the Tata Ultra Mega coal-fired power complex in Gujarat India44 ­ a mammoth 4 GW series of five power plants ­ stating that its approach involves investment focus on ""leveraging Kyoto Mechanisms (Clean Development Mechanism), to enhance the attractiveness of less GHG intensive energy generation and delivery approaches"". David Wheeler, Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development says: ""instead of supporting critical zero-emissions energy investments, scarce international resources are sweetening a private sector project that will emit over 700 million tonnes of CO2 during its operating life"". To put this into perspective, the entire targeted savings announced in the first three UK carbon budgets, from 2008-2022, are 800 million tonnes. In practice, any fossil fuel project that offers even marginal improvements can claim CERs. Yet as International Rivers put it, ""[...] technological advancement means that a power plant entering construction today can be expected to be more efficient than one built five or ten years ago"".

20 MW coke oven gas project in Lingxi, China
Registered in February 2009 this CDM project claims to reduce carbon by using waste gas from a coke oven plant to generate electricity. The project says that this ""will displace grid power generated by coal-fired power plants"". But electricity use is growing rapidly in the region. It will not displace grid power ­ the coal will still get used.

Hydro and wind projects
Other schemes exaggerate the amount of carbon saved. For example wind and hydro projects in China routinely claim to be saving carbon because they are displacing dirty fossil fuel from the grid, and compare these projects with historical averages of carbon intensity of electricity. Yet these projects are not displacing fossil-fuel stations, but are additional stations to meet growing electricity demand. It would be more accurate to compare the wind project with the projected carbon intensity of the region's electricity. These projections would include wind and hydro projects, as they are an agreed part of the Chinese Government's strategy for electricity generation, which gives ""priority to renewable power when transmitted to the state power grid"". The Chinese Government also says: ""China will continue to promote the comprehensive cascading development of water-power-rich river valleys. It will quicken the pace of constructing large hydropower stations.""47 It is almost impossible to know what the wind project displaces. As International Rivers puts it: ""If Windfarms R Us hadn't built their project, would MegacarbonCorp have sold more coal-fuelled power, or would Standard Wind have gone forward with their project instead?""48

Two impossibilities: Proving additionality and proving carbon cuts
International Rivers says:
""While baseline-and-credit trading may have made sense as a theoretical concept to the sleep-starved negotiators in Kyoto, applying it in the real world has shown it to be fatally flawed. The concept depends on being able to give accurate answers to two inherently unanswerable questions.
""To know a project is eligible, one must know whether it is being built only because the developers will be able to sell offsets (ie it is additional). To know how many offsets to grant to the project one must know what would have happened had the project not been built (ie what would the business-as-usual, or ""baseline"" emissions be).
""English Journalist Dan Welch gives a neat summary of the difficulty of determining the `right' quantity of avoided emissions: `Offsets are an imaginary commodity created by deducting what you hope happens from what you guess would have happened.'""49
The US GAO states:
""[...] because additionality is based on projections of what would have occurred in the absence of the CDM, which are necessarily hypothetical, it is impossible to know with certainty whether any given project is additional.""50

4. Offsetting delays necessary infrastructure changes in developed countries
Offsets weaken emissions-reduction targets in developed countries, and this in turn eases the pressure on polluters both to invest to cut emissions and to avoid investments that are high carbon. Polluters are more willing to make high-carbon investments if they feel that they can buy cheap offsets to cover them in forthcoming budgets.
Long-term climate stability will require developed economies to move away almost entirely from technologies that emit carbon dioxide, which requires huge changes in their infrastructure -- starting now. Decisions on the mix and relative carbon-intensity of a wide range of power stations will be made in the coming few years, and these stations will last 40 years. The UK Climate Change Committee said: ""A policy of relying too much on purchased credits in the initial years could make a stretching 2050 domestic target unachievable.""51

Allowing offsetting will have a major negative impact. For example, the UK's Climate Change Commitee argued in December 2008 that ""any path to an 80% reduction by 2050 requires that electricity generation is almost entirely decarbonised by 2030"".
The Committee also said that electricity demand is likely to increase heavily. This means there is a huge job to do to transform the electricity system. Given lags in putting new infrastructure in place, the next five to 10 years are critical in achieving the 2030 goal.
This analysis holds for other countries within the EU ETS. So decisions taken in the next 10 years are crucial. The massive amount of offsetting via CDM allowed in the EU is perhaps the biggest single barrier to decarbonising electricity generation.
The EUETS allows 50 per cent of all the emissions reductions in Phase 2 and Phase 3 (2008-2020) to be made via offsets54, covering major electricity generation. The recently

""A policy of relying too much on purchased credits in the initial years could make a stretching 2050 domestic target unachievable.""
agreed EU Effort Sharing Directive, covering the EU's climate strategy to 2020, allows 73 per cent of all the emissions reductions from 2013-2020 in the non-EUETS sectors to be made via offsets. This covers the housing, transport and commercial sectors, which could be poised for a revolution in the generation of decentralised renewable energy and electricity.

""any growth in aviation emissions from the expansion of Heathrow would be fully offset by a reduction in emissions elsewhere [...] it is simply wrong to say that more planes at Heathrow means there will be more CO2 emissions overall"". UK transport Minister

18

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

Because they are delaying these changes, offsetting is a major barrier to action to prevent dangerous climate change. Offsetting makes it far more likely that developed countries will continue on a high-carbon path, choosing to buy cheap permits rather than invest in low-carbon infrastructure.
This is not just a problem for developed countries. Investment in low-carbon technologies would make them cheaper and more widely available for developing countries to take up, and enable them to avoid following the same high-carbon development path as developed countries.
For example, rapid take-up of solar, tidal, wave and off-shore wind power opportunities will make it far more likely that developing countries will be able to use these technologies rather than follow the high-carbon path of hundreds of new gas- and coal-fired power stations.
Just as offsets weaken the incentives for industry to avoid highcarbon infrastructure investments, they also weaken the incentives for governments to take the radical and urgent action needed. Not investing in a low-carbon path has short- and medium-term economic costs, as well as long-term ones through lock-in.

UK Government using trading to justify high-carbon investment

Because high levels of allowed offsets weaken an already very weak cap in the EUETS, very high carbon developments are being deemed acceptable by EU governments. For example:

· The recent UK Government

decision to allow expansion of

Heathrow will result in an additional

180 million tonnes of carbon

dioxide being emitted. The UK

Government's transport Minister

justified this by stating that aviation

would soon be part of EUETS, and

therefore ""any growth in aviation

emissions from the expansion of

Heathrow would be fully offset by a

reduction in emissions elsewhere

[...] it is simply wrong to say that

more planes at Heathrow means

there

will

be

more

CO 2

emissions

overall"".

· A leaked Government document suggests one reason the UK Government in 2007 was reluctant to pursue renewable energy targets is that they would threaten the EUETS carbon price. In other word trading is used as an argument not to adopt a low-carbon strategy, when its ostensible purpose is to ensure that countries do.

The UK's new carbon budgets and offsetting
Under the terms of the Climate Change Act 2008 the UK Government has set five-year carbon budgets. In doing so the Government has largely adopted the Climate Change Committee's (CCC) advice, but set out its intentions on offsetting for the first period 2008-2012 only. Offsetting is allowed within EU rules in the EUETS sectors, and not allowed in the nonEUETS sectors. The CCC recommends two targets ­ an interim 2020 target of 34 per cent cuts in GHGs, and an intended target of 42 per cent if a ""global deal"" were done at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen in December 2009. In the traded sector, for the second two budget periods the CCC recommends that offsetting be allowed up to EU agreed limits ­ which allow 50 per cent of the total EU effort to be made by offsetting. In the non-traded sector for the second two periods the CCC recommends no offsetting under the interim target, unless a global deal is made ­ in which case the entire difference between interim and intended could be made via offsetting. These proposals mean offsetting has a massive impact on the likely effort the UK has to make to cut carbon at home.

4.Offsetting Undermines low-carbon development in developing countries
In practice offsetting is not helping developing countries transform their economies to a low-carbon path. In many cases it is locking them in to a high-carbon, unsustainable path. There are four main reasons for this:
Offsetting does not help with new technology or innovation, because of its focus on cheapest options
The biggest source of CDM credits is in applying widely available technologies to clean up greenhouse gases like N2O and HFC from chemical installations. The technology to strip N2O from nitric acid plants ­ a secondary catalyst to convert N2O to nitrogen and oxygen ­ is decades old. These are end-of-pipe, old technologies with little other economic, social or environmental value. This is not to say that the projects have no value: it is important to prevent these gases from being vented. But using the CDM to do it prevents emissions reductions in developed countries, does nothing to move developing-country infrastructure away from a high-carbon path and distracts attention from many sustainable development projects in developing countries.

It is also an economically inefficient means of funding emissions reductions in developing countries. Wara estimates that HFC projects in the CDM as of 2006 would generate Euros 4. billion of credits for refrigerant manufacturers, but destroying the gases costs less than Euros 100 million. A similar situation occurs for N2O projects, where the price of CERs is tens of times more than the cost of introducing the technology.
For these end-of-pipe technologies, a different mechanism is needed that gives factory owners the cash they need to install the low-carbon technology, freeing up resources to spend on more projects helping developing countries, and requiring the developed country to address its domestic emissions. This would deliver these cuts at far lower cost.
It is likely that CDM is helping lock in developing countries to a high-carbon path. For example, the revenues going to the corporations fitting HFC and N2O and fossil-fuel efficiency projects and new coaland gas-fired power plants ­ which account for well over half of the total credits are not going to be spent on renewable or sustainable development projects. They are going to corporations that are building more fossil-fuel intensive industries.

Some big CDM projects are even for major new fossil-fuel power stations such as the Tanjavur plant (see page 16). It is claimed that these are more efficient than existing stations. Yet these projects are doing no more than ensure the new stations meet the standards of existing best-practice plants ­ and those are extremely inefficient, high-carbon intensity plants that might have been built anyway.
Hydro plants are a major part of the CDM portfolio. They too are not using radical new technology and in many countries are part of existing development plans. New technologies such as solar are expected to account for as little as 0. per cent of total CDM credits by 2012.

20

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

Offsetting can block new laws or practices
CDM rules can lead to a regulatory chill, creating an incentive for developing countries not to implement laws to cut carbon emissions.
A project can claim to be additional only if it can show that there are no laws compelling the introduction of the new technology. Companies will lobby for developing countries not to implement such new laws, so that they can continue to claim credits. There are also incentives for the government itself not to implement such laws. For example, the Chinese Government gets tax revenue from the sale of CERs. CDM registration documents for N2O destruction projects in China routinely states that ""there is no regulation or incentive to eliminate N2O emissions for nitric acid plants"". Nor would there be if both developer and Government benefit financially from the current situation. CDM project documents expect the current status to continue, saying: ""In fact, many other companies in the Host Country are currently planning or developing similar CDM project activities"".

Offsetting could have a particularly undesirable impact for some types of project. For example a Joint Committee of the UK Parliament has said that:
""the economic incentives offered by the CDM appear actually to be encouraging the building of refrigerant plants in the developing world, simply in order that the HFC by-products from the plant can be incinerated, and the credits generated from this sold at a large profit.""61
Proposals under discussion for a REDD mechanism based upon a baseline of deforestation also risk creating the perverse incentive for countries with low current levels of deforestation to increase their level of deforestation in order to subsequently be able to claim greater amounts of finance on the basis of reduced deforestation, thus increasing carbon emissions in the short term.

""the economic incentives offered by the CDM appear actually to be encouraging the building of refrigerant plants in the developing world, simply in order that the HFC by-products from the plant can be incinerated, and the credits generated from this sold at a large profit.""

Gas flaring in Nigeria
The Kwale gas project in Nigeria intends to captures gas that is being illegally flared, and using it to generate electricity. The company applying to CDM has been flaring gas for years. The design document, in arguing that the project is additional because there are no laws to mandate companies not to flare gas, says: ""Whilst the Nigerian High Court recently judged that gas flaring is illegal, it is difficult to envisage a situation where wholesale changes in practice in venting or flaring, or cessation of oil production in order to eliminate flaring will be forthcoming in the near term.""62 In other words, there is a law, but the company apparently does not feel it should comply and will only comply if paid to do so. Companies are even less likely to comply with this law if they feel that by disobeying it the industry will be able to obtain CDM credits. The United States Government Accounting Office concludes:
""The CDM does not credit emission reductions that result from newly imposed policies or standards, in part because it would be difficult to demonstrate that emission reductions were a direct result of the law. This may pose a dilemma for host countries that want to implement low-carbon policies but also want to attract investment through the CDM.""63

21

Offsetting doesn't deliver sustainable development
Many CDM projects have major negative environmental and social impacts, as documented by organisations such as International Rivers and Cornerhouse. This is not to say that CDM is causing these problems: as argued earlier many projects would have happened anyway. But CDM is not only meant to help mitigate climate change but deliver sustainable development benefits. These benefits have not materialised.
An analysis in 2007 of a sample of CDM projects found that a mere 1. per cent of CERs were issued to projects with sustainable development benefits.
Michaelowa and Michaelowa report that

Some CDM projects will actually harm existing projects with strong sustainable development benefits, as well as failing to deliver carbon benefits themselves.
The average cost of the CDM approval and monitoring process is an initial US$ 100,000-265,000, plus annual costs of US$ 15,000-25,000 in subsequent years. This creates a bias towards large-scale projects, and against smaller ones that tend to work with local communities to deliver sustainable development.
The US GAO reports that
""it may be possible to achieve the CDM's sustainable development goals and emissions cuts in developing countries more directly and cost-effectively through a means other than the existing mechanism"".

Energy from waste in Bali
In Bali, Indonesia a new CDM compliant waste-to-energy incinerator claims to avoid the release of methane from the breakdown of organic waste in landfills. Yet ""most organic waste is fed to pigs; the project would take that waste from farmers to throw into landfill in order to purposefully increase methane generation. Some portion of these emissions would then be captured and burned in order to claim carbon credits."" The project is threatening the existence of an award-winning sustainable development recycling project employing 40 local residents. The coordinator of the recycling project says ""the local environment agency has told me that we need to shut down our recycling operation in order to send more waste to the landfill to generate CDM credits"".

""projects addressing the poor directly are very rare and [...] even small renewable energy projects in rural areas tend to benefit richer farmers and the urban population"".

Hydro plant, India
A large hydro plant on the Bhilangana river, India, is threatening to destroy an ""ingenious, extremely low carbon system of agriculture"" where local farmers run a finely-tuned terraced irrigation system to produce rice, wheat, mustard, fruit and vegetables ­ a ""uniquely sustainable modern technology"".*71

Risks from REDD Proposals for a market REDD mechanism pose significant risks to sustainable development. The definition of a forest under the Kyoto Protocol allows for the replacement of natural forest with plantations. If this definition were to be carried over into a REDD mechanism then REDD finance could well be used to fund conversion to plantation forestry which stores as little as 20 per cent of the carbon that intact natural forest does.
Proposals for a market REDD mechanism are likely to drive up the value of forest lands, which risks increasing the likelihood that forest lands will be wrested away from forest-dependent communities, who are likely to be marginalised already within their countries. The commodification of forest carbon is likely to be inherently inequitable as it discriminates against women and other marginalised groups who rely on free access to forest resources.
Denying local and indigenous communities access to forest resources could have severe impacts on poverty alleviation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

Cash flows from offsetting are not effective
Offsetting creates the idea in developed countries that such investment is a prime way to help developing countries move down a low-carbon path, and of discharging developed countries' responsibilities set out under the UNFCCC. But even if the many problems with offsetting could be ironed out, it is not an appropriate mechanism to achieve adequate and effective financial flows.
CDM revenues to developing countries from the EU are likely to be less than US$ 5 billion a year to 2020. This is around a tenth of a fair EU contribution toward the global mitigation costs estimated by the UN.
Proponents of offsetting argue that the CDM and other offsetting mechanisms need to expand massively to achieve larger financial transfers. But the root problems with swaps ­ proving additionality and proving carbon reductions ­ are not capable of reform. Expansion would worsen the impact of offsetting on climate change. Mechanisms of a completely different scale and nature are needed to support developing countries to pursue a low-carbon path. These mechanisms must not delay developed countries sprinting down their own low-carbon path.

5 offsetting and INjustice

Any defined emissions cuts by developed countries as a whole have major implications for development and equity for developing countries, as analysis by the Third World Network (TWN) has highlighted.
In particular, developing countries could be indirectly committing themselves to inequitable cuts if industrialised countries follow current ambition levels and seek offsetting supply credits.
Table 5 below is an indication of what per capita emissions scenarios might look like in 2050, based on publically declared emissions targets, current rates of offsetting, and UN projections of population growth to 2050. The table demonstrates the implications for developing countries' per capita emissions, with and without offsetting, if developed countries agree an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 under an overall global goal of 50 per cent by 2050.

Even under the scenario without any offsetting, 80 per cent emissions reductions in developed countries are not sufficient to ensure a levelling of per capita emissions in 2050.
Inadequate ambition from developed countries, combined with offsetting, equates to a steep relative worsening in inequality for developing countries. Whereas the current per capita carbon consumption in developed countries is at least three times that of developing-country per capita emissions, the offsetting scenario presented here would increase this inequality to a factor of more than eight. Such scenarios are morally unjustifiable, conflict with agreements under the UNFCCC, and would probably undermine other international treaties including the UN Declaration on the Right to Development.

The scenarios in this section have been concerned with equity issues of current and projected per capita emissions only. However, data on cumulative emissions from 1850 show that developed countries bear an even greater responsibility. Some 76 per cent of emissions from 1850 to 2002 came from developed countries; in 2002 developed countries had less than 20 per cent of the global population.
This analysis is not intended to paint an impossibly bleak picture or to blame everything on developed countries. It is intended to demonstrate that the current negotiating positions of developed countries are inadequate and unfair, and need to change urgently. Even an 80 per cent 2050 target for developed countries as part of a 50 per cent global cut is not a fair distribution for developing countries, given historic contributions. Offsetting would deepen the injustice, as it is fundamentally a financial instrument to transfer the responsibilty to reduce emissions to developing countries.


A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

Inequitable and unjust outcomes can be avoided only if developed countries take on much greater cuts than currently agreed, and ensure these are achieved entirely domestically without any recourse to offsetting.
Just as crucially, developed countries must commit to additional finance and technology to enable energy efficiency and appropriate renewable technologies for clean sustainable development in developing countries.
Finally, the climate impacts on developing countries must be fully compensated by developed countries through adequate adaptation funding.

A fair global transition to a low-carbon future must be achieved through cooperation between developed and developing countries acting in good faith. The relentless finger-pointing by developed countries at total emissions from populous developing countries cannot mask the injustice of the developed countries' positions and the implied developing country emissions pathways in per capita terms.
Without assurance from developed countries that they will substantially raise their emissions reductions commitments, do so domestically, and ensure a radical shift in global financing toward the global good, it is highly unlikely effective collective action will be achieved.

6 WHY OFFSETTING CANNOT BE REFORMED, WHY IT SHOULD NOT BE EXPANDED, WHY IT SHOULD BE SCRAPPED

Summarising sections 4 and 5, offsetting suffers from the following problems:
· It merely swaps action in developed countries for action in developing countries, when both are needed.
As action is needed in both developed and developing countries, CDM ­ based on swaps ­ is at heart preventing this from happening. CDM means delays in developed countries. Reform cannot stop this.
The developing-country projects don't guarantee the same level of carbon savings as could have been made in the developed country:
· Usually it is impossible to say whether a project is additional ­ that it would not have happened without CDM support.
· In the absence of targets, there is no way of calculating accurately how much carbon equivalent is being saved ­ there are no guaranteed carbon reductions.

The swaps are not equivalent to cuts in a developed country and are therefore less beneficial for the climate.
These failings are routinely dismissed by advocates of a global cap and trade, who argue such problems would be overcome if developing countries also operated under a legally-binding cap. It is, however implausible that such a scheme could be established within the timeframes necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, even if it could be politically agreed or made operationally effective. The EU's Emissions Trading Scheme demonstrates the operational failings of over-allocation of allowances and corporate influence in achieving specific sector exemptions. Further, even an ideal cap and trade would in any case produce significantly worse equity outcomes in per capita emissions consumption as outlined in section 5 above. The most effective and fair alternative is to ensure developed countries agree on, and begin delivering, significantly deeper reductions at home, and provide the substantial financial and technology flows necessary to begin emissions deviation in developing countries.

Some people argue for reform of CDM to ensure that it does deliver guaranteed and additional cuts. As this report has illustrated, however, proving additionality is virtually impossible, and proving guaranteed cuts is impossible in the absence of agreed targets. On the grounds of swap, additionality and guaranteed emissions, CDM is not capable of reform.
In practice, creating a carbon offset market through CDM is not leading to more and more ingenious ways to cut carbon; it is creating more and more ingenious ways to count things as carbon credits (ie creating loopholes). Examples of the creation of loopholes would include attempts now to broaden CDM and offsetting to forest sinks and so-called sectoral offset approaches. This is all a huge distraction from getting massive investment into new low-carbon technologies in developed countries.

26

A dangerous distraction Friends of the Earth

On top of this, the extra benefits claimed for CDM are not being realised:
· Sustainable development benefits are very low.
Sustainable development benefits could potentially be improved by reforms such as better participation in decisions, or bans on certain types of project. However, these approaches would make the validation stage of the CDM process even slower than it is already. At present there is such high pressure to increase the flow of credits that it is likely that any such reforms would simply drive the expansion of offsetting into other arenas (such as forests). The problems of additionality, guaranteed reduction and failure to ensure sustainable development benefits that bedevil current offsetting schemes would apply to new offsetting mechanisms also.

· Financial transfers are small, they are going to the wrong sectors, and they are not helping low-carbon development.
The majority of financial transfers76 are currently not going to activities that help developing countries move along a low-carbon path.
Even if CDM were reformed so that a higher proportion of funds went to low-carbon projects, the scale of CDM is such that it cannot be a main tool for getting the needed funds to developing countries.
Mechanisms are needed to help developing countries constrain their emissions growth, without leading to reduced effort from developed countries.
Finally, in practice CDM can hinder the development of laws and policies to deliver a low carbon path in developing countries, through ""regulatory chill"".
CDM should be scrapped, not reformed, and developed countries should honour their targets by making carbon cuts at home.
A new set of mechanisms is needed to deliver financial transfers and to aid sustainable development in developing countries.

7 recommendations

Governments should:
1. Agree that developed countries must reduce their own emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2020, excluding offsetting.
2.Reject all forms of offsetting: proposals for new and expanded offsetting schemes must be dropped, and existing offsetting mechanisms need to be scrapped.
3.Reject plans to introduce REDD offsets, and instead negotiate effective and fair mechanisms to protect the Earth's forests that do not involve offsetting.
4.Negotiate a new financial mechanism under the authority of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to ensure adequate financial flows to developing countries to support their transition to a low-carbon future.
The scrapping of CDM and non-expansion of offsetting into other areas are clear policy demands. How to protect forests in other ways is covered in other Friends of the Earth briefings* (see also Forests and offset-based REDD mechanisms, right). For more detail on financial transfers see section 7..

Reject plans to introduce redd offsets
Forest offsetting suffers from all of the problems with CDM, but with some important additions:
· Carbon reductions are even less guaranteed -- forests could become a net source of carbon instead of a sink as the planet warms up.
· Protecting forests is a complex socio-economic issue requiring policies that respect the land rights of indigenous peoples and forest communities.
· The complex pressures on forests (demand for forest products, illegal logging, displacement of people from other lands) demand complex governance arrangements not suitable to forest carbon trading.
Any mechanism intended to stop deforestation must be designed to fully address these issues for it to be effective and just. Further reading is available at the Friends of the Earth International website.
For these reasons, proposals to link REDD finance to the offset market should be rejected outright.

7. Financial transfers to developing countries
The Stern Review estimated that mitigation to stabilise at even 500 ppmv CO2e (itself an extremely dangerous level) would cost around 2 per cent of global GDP annually ­ more than US$1 trillion; and that adaptation costs are likely to rise to hundreds of billions of dollars a year (depending on the scale of climate change).
The African Group of Nations in the UN climate negotiations argue that developing nations will need at least US$ 200 billion a year for mitigation, and US$ 67 billion a year for adaptation by 2020. The size of revenues needed is very large.
Research undertaken by the UK's New Economics Foundation (NEF) [80] summarises the rationale and need for developed countries to fund the bulk of these costs:
""Unlike their developed country counterparts, who grew their economies generating energy at low cost and without particular environmental consideration, the responsible trajectory now asked of developing countries will require significantly greater investment. As with adaptation, there is therefore a degree of moral obligation for developed countries to finance this process. As well, there is practical necessity. Developing countries simply do not have the capacity to address poverty and human development while simultaneously adapting to and mitigating climate change.""



Not only is this a matter of moral and practical necessity however, developed countries have unfulfilled binding commitments under the UNFCCC relating to financing and technology transfer.
Although significant differences remain between developed and developing countries on the form and scale such a financial mechanism should take, it is widely accepted that current international financial flows are simply not working (as stated by the Chair of the UNFCCC working group on finance in plenary, Poznan December 2008).
Private capital flows through offsetting mechanisms are not sufficient or appropriate to address the root causes and solutions to climate change, as demonstrated throughout this report; new mechanisms must be agreed. Friends of the Earth believes a significant increase in developed country public sector funding is necessary to achieve the shared goal of avoiding dangerous climate change.
Such a mechanism can only effectively operate under the governance of the UNFCCC. To most developing countries, it is simply not acceptable to distribute climate funds through existing channels such as the World Bank, which have been and continue to be dominated by western governments. Further, the well-documented negative social and environmental impacts of their policies have effectively discredited them from holding any competent governance or regulatory role in international climate finance.
There are various financial mechanism proposals currently under consideration in the UNFCCC. It is likely no one single proposal will be sufficient, but rather a package of sources required.

Exactly what mix of sources countries agree to, what governance arrangements are in place, and what types of activities will be funded, will be a matter for critical negotiations leading up to the Copenhagen UN climate talks.
A new financial mechanism under the UNFCCC should have the following basic organising principles81:
· Adequate levels and predictability of finance. Finance must be obligatory and contributed on agreed responsibility indicators according to historical and current per capita emissions that meet the needs identified for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.
· Representative governance. Developing countries should have strong, direct equitable representation in any fund's decision-making and technical bodies, with representation for civil society groups and indigenous people. The governance of any fund must be democratic, accountable and transparent.
· Participatory planning and access for the most vulnerable. People potentially affected by projects must be centrally involved in decisions around how and whether these projects are developed and implemented.

· Capacity building and strengthening of rights. People should be at the heart of financing proposals, with resources directed to building local capacity, and sharing of expertise. Key global agreements, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples must be upheld, as well as the right to development, food and energy sovereignty, and gender justice.

Finally, in addition to new international climate finance, we propose major reforms to two existing financial flows which are currently major barriers to global clean sustainable development.

· Stop carbon-intensive financial

flows.There are major public and

private investment flows channelled

into high-carbon infrastructure via

multilateral bodies such as the

World Bank and the European

Investment Bank. The World Bank

alone financed 26 Gigatonnes

of

CO 2

emissions

(45

times

UK

emissions) between 1997 and

2007, and increased lending for

coal, gas and oil by 94 per cent in

the past year.

· Cancel debt. At least US$ 400 billion of debt relief is immediately needed to enable developing countries to meet the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Developing countries pay more than US$ 30 billion a year in debt-interest payments.

The year we achieved a landmark breakthrough

In 2008 Andy Atkins took over as Executive Director of Friends of the Earth. He reflects on his first year in the post and thanks our supporters up and down the country whose powerful commitment has made the difference.

I cut my teeth campaigning on human rights, moved into international development then increasingly focused on the environment. Of course they`re inextricably linked. Uniquely in my experience, Friends of the Earth combines them all, defending the environment and people's rights to a healthy environment, promoting truly sustainable development here and globally.

I've worked with many inspiring people and have been involved in some remarkable campaigns, like Make Poverty History. But in my first year at Friends of the Earth I've been deeply impressed by the way staff, volunteers and supporters have engaged their local communities and politicians in practical solutions to tackle the threats to the environment that we all rely on. We cannot thank you enough.
An extraordinary groundswell of support meant 2008 was the year we achieved a landmark breakthrough: on 26 November 2008 the Climate Change Act passed into law, the result

The year at a glance

of a campaign started by Friends of the Earth and embraced by many other organisations. The law is a world first, creating a framework for the UK to make legally binding cuts in greenhouse gases right up to 2050. Of course we didn't stop there. As you'll read, we are now building on this success with three even more ambitious campaigns: Demand Climate Change, Get Serious About CO2, and The Food Chain. These embody our integrated response to the two greatest environmental problems confronting humanity ­ climate change and biodiversity loss.

This is the age of the global challenge ­ and our campaigns must increasingly meet the challenges at an international level. So I feel privileged to draw on the inspiration and learning of friendships and campaigns from my years in the development sector. Today as never before we must drive to the top of the agenda the needs of people hand in hand with the needs of a healthy planet.
After perhaps the most effective year in Friends of the Earth's history, we must continue to keep up the momentum and build on our collective achievements. This annual review offers a wealth of

ideas and evidence which show that, together, we are capable of changing the world for the better. Yours
Andy Atkins Executive Director

The Big Ask. The big breakthrough

Our Big Ask campaign for pioneering climate change legislation delivered a spectacular advance for the global environmental movement. Thanks to supporters like you, this fouryear campaign secured every one of our key demands.
The Big Ask was the most ambitious campaign Friends of the Earth had ever mounted. And it worked: 200,000 people of every age and background persuaded the UK Government to pass the first ever climate change law. This means there will be: 1) legally binding annual cuts in greenhouse gases; 2) an overall target of 80 per cent reductions by 2050; and 3) the inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping.
How did we do it? By changing the way the wind was blowing in politics, raising awareness nationwide and inspiring people from all walks of life to get involved. We built the campaign on robust research and worked with a range of expert partners to create public pressure that the Government simply could not ignore. This, alongside detailed lobbying by our expert campaigners helped secure the support of MPs from across the political spectrum. The Government and opposition listened ­ and the resulting Act is a success we should all be proud of.
BUILDING ON the Climate Change Act We're working to make sure that the Climate Change Act results in practical action so that the emissions reduction targets are met, year after year. Already we've secured two very significant measures that will help boost UK production of renewable energy.

Renewable energy strategy In 2008 the European Union debated proposals for renewable energy targets. In the face of intense resistance from the UK Government, our awareness-raising and activism built momentum for a strong UK target. We worked with partners including the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, of which we are a founder member, and inspired thousands of people to ask the Government to change its course. We won. The UK has a target of producing 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. That's a massive gain from a starting point of just 2 per cent. This achievement will help communities across the UK struggling to reduce their carbon footprint.
Feed-in tariffs The UK lags behind most of Europe in generating renewable electricity. One main reason is the lack of a financial incentive for communities, households, farmers, businesses and local authorities to install their own renewable electricity.
Germany has for some years operated a feed-in tariff ­ a premium paid for electricity from renewable sources. As a result the country has 10 times more wind power and over 200 times more solar power than the UK. Feed-in tariffs have proven to be a successful way to boost renewable electricity generation in 20 European countries. The potential in the UK is immense.
This is why we mounted a campaign this year for the UK to introduce a feed in tariff. We welcomed the support of parliamentarians, civil society, unions, businesses, investors and celebrities as we led a successful coalition effort to include such a measure in the Energy Act 2008. This was one of our most significant wins this year and could completely transform Britain's supply of energy. As a result we were named Advocate of 2009 at the British Renewable Energy Awards.

The Big Ask goes global The Big Ask campaign is now spreading across the world ­ and we're supporting our partners with all the experience and knowledge we gained from our success in the UK. Campaigns in 17 EU countries are demanding governments commit to reducing carbon emissions. That's Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, The Netherlands, Scotland, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.
In all these countries The Big Ask is proving a powerful vehicle for raising awareness in innovative and challenging ways ­ and getting results. A short film by Friends of the Earth in Belgium was seen by well over 1 million people on Belgian TV ­ and the national Green Party has tabled a proposal for a climate law ensuring annual emissions cuts. In Austria politicians are adopting a climate bill; and, in Finland, two climate bills on greenhouse gas emissions have been submitted.

""You have changed history and you have changed what Britain does and hopefully what the world does. I think you should be very, very proud of what you have achieved... This was an incredible team effort ­ by politicians, but most of all by the popular movement that was led by Friends of the Earth.""
­ Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change

""MPs received over 500,000 pieces of correspondence from the public calling for the Bill ­ a fantastic example of public campaigning from Friends of the Earth.""
­ Dr Greg Clark MP, Conservative Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change

""It would have been absolutely impossible for those of us who were campaigning for that [the Climate Change Act] inside Parliament to achieve that without the external pressure that came from all of you ­ and Friends of the Earth in particular.""
­ Martin Horwood MP, Liberal Democrat Shadow Environment Minister

The Big Challenge: a fast-changing context

In a tumultuous year for the global economy we have shown why the environment needs to remain top of the political agenda. By briefing MPs, media and opinion formers, and ensuring an informed public debate through our local groups, we have pressed the argument for practical, just and planet-friendly solutions to the economic crisis. This has included promoting the benefits to the economy of a thriving solar and wind-power industry, and providing ways for people to conserve energy and cut their fuel bills.

Imminent threats Humanity faces two massive threats: climate change and biodiversity loss.
The planet has already warmed by 1 degree since the Industrial Revolution. Beyond 2 degrees, there is a far greater chance we will trigger runaway global warming.
The amazing diversity of life on Earth is under threat. Scientists believe we are in the midst of the biggest mass extinction since the end of the dinosaurs ­ and that human activities are causing it.
Our response? This year with your vital support we have launched three major campaigns. Building on the momentum of The Big Ask our new campaigns are tackling local and global emissions and defending the biodiversity and finely-balanced natural systems that we rely on utterly.
Through these linked campaigns we're pushing for a strong and just global agreement on tackling climate change; encouraging councils across Britain to make deep cuts in emissions under their control; and making one of the most polluting industries ­ meat and dairy ­ more environmentally responsible.

Barack Obama in a speech on the challenges of energy and climate change
Demand Climate Change

In the lead-up to the UN climate talks in

Copenhagen in 2009 and beyond we've

been making a powerful case for international climate justice.

In partnership with 51 Friends of the Earth groups across five continents we are calling for rich countries to meet their legal and moral responsibilities to lead in addressing global warming.
Ahead of the Copenhagen talks in particular we argued that rich countries must cut their own emissions ­ by at least 40 per cent by 2020 without carbon offsetting. Our research showed that offsetting swaps real cuts in rich countries for hypothetical cuts in developing countries. Yet meeting our own emissions reduction targets would put our economies on a secure low-carbon development path

­ reducing our dependence on fossil fuel and creating new green jobs at home.
We also called for the rich world to provide new money to developing countries so they can grow cleanly, while adapting to the effects of climate change that are already affecting millions of people.
Speaking out across the world As part of Friends of the Earth International, a federation with 77 member groups, we have roots and influence across the world. We worked shoulder to shoulder with our international partners to prepare for the talks in Copenhagen in 2009.

For example, alongside colleagues from Malaysia and Germany we launched our report on offsetting A Dangerous Distraction at the UN climate meeting in Bonn in June. Representatives from a wide range of countries drew on it substantially during those negotiations.
In the same week we launched a global online campaign to press rich countries to act for climate justice. The petition got off to a flying start, gaining 10,000 signatures from five continents in the first two weeks.
Our work built towards the talks themselves, where we sought to influence decision makers both inside negotiations and from the outside ­ planning a peaceful public show of concern, The Flood, in the Danish capital in December.

""Ours is a voice united in the call for change. Ours is a role defined by the need ­ to help lead the development of a global movement for climate justice to ensure a safe climate.""
Senior international Climate Campaigner Asad Rehman

""The world is at a crossroads. [We] must come to the most ambitious agreement ever negotiated or continue to accept mass starvation, mass sickness and mass migration on an ever growing scale. If leaders cannot assume responsibility, they will fail humanity."" Kofi Annan

For more updates on Demand Climate Change: www.demandclimatechange.org


Our campaign for local action seeks a 40 per cent cut in climate-changing emissions in communities across the UK.

Local authorities can influence emissions from housing, energy and transport, which together amount to 80 per cent of UK emissions. But few are acting with the ambition or urgency we need to see real change on our doorsteps.
Get Serious About CO2 shows people how they can influence decision-makers locally to reduce emissions from homes, provide lowcarbon transport options, and begin to grow renewable power.
The effects should soon be all around us. We are pressing local authorities to provide free loft and cavity-wall insulation; to back renewable energy

such as solar water heating for homes; to consider small-scale wind farms; and to promote better public transport, walking and cycling. We also need a switch to low-carbon vehicles such as electric cars.
Progressive, practical schemes like these will create new jobs at a time of rising unemployment, cut fuel bills and make our towns better places to live and work.

Progress so far Already we're working with 80 of our local groups, who are taking the campaign to local people and building pressure on their local authorities to act. Nationally we're looking to create the framework that will promote local action. We're researching the practical benefits of communities going green ­ the jobs, the numbers of people able to escape fuel poverty. We're the only organisation tackling this issue at local level by generating grassroots pressure on councillors.

""With strong arguments on our side, we are winning people over and soon we'll start seeing real changes in our local environment.""
Senior UK Climate Campaigner Tony Bosworth

Rolling out the Climate Act means getting down to business ­ like making homes cheaper to heat

""Our research shows that local action to cut CO2 will be good for people and the economy. If a national energy efficiency programme were launched in partnership with councils to insulate homes and businesses, and fit green energy to buildings, it could create at least 70,000 jobs across England and Wales ­ and slash fuel bills.""
Senior UK Climate Campaigner Tony Bosworth on why Get Serious About CO2 matters to ordinary people.

Brazilian priest and activist, Father Edilberto Sena. In 2008 we arranged for Father Sena to meet UK politicians to highlight the treatment of local people at the hands of big business.

The Food Chain
Our new Food Chain campaign exposes the destructive chain stretching from our kitchens to the forests in South America.

Putting the future of planet­ friendly farming in the hands of local producers

Why this campaign, now? Our research has shown that one industry produces more climate changing gases than all the planes, lorries and cars put together ­ and also drives deforestation.
If we're to prevent catastrophic climate change and dangerous biodiversity loss we can't ignore the damage that factory farming is doing. The Government is all but ignoring the meat and dairy industry's environmental hoofprint. In fact, it's pumping millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into intensive farming ­ the most damaging kind.
This year we launched our call for the Government to support good food, thriving farms and a healthy planet.

This means backing small and planet-friendly farming and making sure that the supermarkets pay our farmers a decent price.
Protecting forests and human rights in Paraguay Paraguay, along with Brazil and Argentina, has seen rapid soy expansion. Senior Food Campaigner Clare Oxborrow helped to expose the links in the food chain in South America through an investigative trip with our partner Sobrevivencia (""survival""), Friends of the Earth Paraguay. She collected eye-witness accounts of forest being destroyed and families forced off their land to make way for soy plantations. This soy ­ most of it genetically

modified ­ is exported to the UK and Europe where it is used to feed pigs, chickens and cows in factory farms.
We are working with Sobrevivencia to make sure local communities are better able to resist these plantations and to promote sustainable alternatives.
Achievements so far The campaign stretches from communities in Paraguay where villagers are resisting big companies, to Westminster where MPs are debating how to implement our solutions.
Within months of the public launch thousands of Friends of the Earth supporters had already asked their MP to fix the food chain. The Guardian and Telegraph

used our research, helping to sway opinion in our favour. Our report What's Feeding our Food? called on the Government to build a healthy domestic farming sector ­ and by May 2009 our parliamentary petition asking for a reformed food chain was one of the most successful of the year, securing cross-party support from a third of MPs.

Protecting biodiversity

Biofuels Rainforest cut down to make way for biofuel crops in the name of tackling climate change? This was the year we exposed this dangerous anomaly and created a massive shift in public perception.
We joined forces with Friends of the Earth Europe as part of the European Biofuels Coalition to expose the problems with biofuels. Our campaigning showed how growing biofuels for crops on an industrial scale is catastrophic for the environment. Destroying rainforest releases carbon emissions, drives local people off their land and into poverty, and wipes out precious biodiversity. We called instead for sound alternatives such as

fuel-efficiency legislation and improved public transport.
""[The campaign] was outstanding and very professional in terms of argument proposed, scientific underpinning, strategic positioning and creativity.""
Our European Biofuels Campaign was named Campaign of the Year in the European Public Affairs Awards 2009

Resource use Europe uses far more than its fair share of the Earth's finite resources. This threatens the planet's biodiversity and climate ­ and is profoundly unjust. Our campaign this year argued for a legallybinding framework to ensure that the European Union reduces its consumption over the next 25 years. Yet without an effective system for measuring resource use the EU cannot set targets to move to a more sustainable footing. Therefore we worked with partners to identify how this could be done ­ running a series of seminars in Brussels with participants from Friends of the Earth groups in Europe, development and social NGOs and the European

Commission. We used our research How to Measure Europe's Resource Use to persuade EU decision-makers to act.
At national and local levels we demonstrated how recycling targets can be delivered in practice in the UK. Our conference ""Maximising Recycling and Minimising Residual Waste"" attracted around 100 people, including representatives from local councils.
We helped the UK Without Incineration Network (UKWIN) set up an online map of planned incinerator sites, helping 61 groups oppose inefficient waste management and promote alternatives.

The regions and nations

Our strong regional presence means we are well placed to drive local solutions to global issues as well as regional-specific problems. This year our expertise and influence again secured some significant successes.

Rights and justice

Friends of the Earth is the only national environmental campaigning organisation providing free legal advice and representation to members of the public through its Rights and Justice Centre.
We worked with the Friends of Queen's Market in East London who were angry about a redevelopment which would threaten the 110-yearold market, selling fresh produce at cheap prices in one of the capital's disadvantaged and most diverse boroughs. It was going to become a building site to make way for luxury flats and a supermarket. But after local people like Pauline and Saif attended Power Up ­ our annual weekend of training and workshops ­ the campaign went into overdrive. As a result, 2,500 individually written letters were submitted to the council and 12,000 people signed a petition. Thanks to this campaign, the Mayor

of London refused planning permission. Friends of Queen's Market are working on a plan for a locally-owned, positive redevelopment that will ensure a bright future for the market.
The Rights and Justice team also took on the Government's plans to replace our democratic planning system for big developments with a one-sided process of consultation ­ a way to fasttrack damaging developments like coal-fired and nuclear power stations, roads, airports, and ports. Over 30,000 people have responded to our call to say this was completely unacceptable. Thanks to our campaign the Government must now consider climate change when drawing up national policy on such big developments.
The team has also demonstrated how sharply we can focus the law in the service of the environment. This year our legal team

scored its first-ever House of Lords victory ­ preventing the police from imposing impossible conditions on the Critical Mass cycle ride to promote green transport in London. All five law lords upheld the group's appeal.

Des Kay, a regular Critical Mass cyclist, says:
``I'm delighted with the outcome, which I hope will persuade more people to come on the rides. Really big thanks to all of you at Friends of the Earth.""

Training in rights bears fruit for Pauline and Saif in East London

In East London we prevented the ill-conceived Thames Gateway Bridge from going ahead. We challenged claims that the scheme was essential for jobs and regeneration, exposed the adverse impacts it would have on local people and proposed better transport solutions. In a similar vein we are working in an alliance to challenge the proposed Mersey Gateway Bridge at a public inquiry.
In the Peak District we joined a coalition of local, regional and national organisations working to save the picturesque and nationally significant Peak Park (see above) from the threat of uncontrolled quarrying. The Court of Appeal upheld our appeal against a controversial High Court decision last year which had effectively removed any controls on quarrying at the site. This may have the knock-on effect of providing protection for other important sites around the country.
Across England we have also acted in support of developments aimed at providing people with clean energy and sustainable transport choices.

Friends of the Earth Cymru celebrated the scrapping of the Gwent Levels motorway scheme. We had argued that the £1 billion, six-lane toll road would boost traffic and carbon emissions and cut a swathe through the protected Gwent Levels ­ damaging biodiversity in one of the largest surviving areas of ancient grazing marshes in Britain (see above). Scrapping the scheme is an opportunity to resolve the existing road's safety and maintenance problems through lower-cost measures along the M4 and other local routes. Friends of the Earth Cymru campaigner Neil Crumpton said:
""The scrapping of the unaffordable and traffic-generating Gwent Levels motorway is vital to tackle climate change and cut Wales' carbon emissions.""

Businesses, trade unions, farmers, voluntary organisations and environ mentalists united around a common platform ­ the Green New Deal for Northern Ireland, modelled on the US New Deal during the depression of the 1930s. Ours calls on Government to create thousands of new jobs by expanding the environmental sector, securing our energy supply and building a competitive low-carbon economy.
Friends of the Earth also brought together a coalition to research measures for housing, public and commercial buildings, renewable energy, sustainable industries, employment and skills and finance mechanisms. In time, this package could transform Northern Ireland and set an example for others.

Local champions LEADING CHANGE

A powerful, committed and well-organised network of people creating change at local level is one of the defining features of Friends of the Earth's contribution to positive change.
Local groups at the Greater South East regional gathering in London May 2009

More than 200 of our groups played a crucial role in bringing the Climate Change Act into being. Lobbying their MPs, working the media, and engaging the public they persuaded MPs overwhelmingly to back the law. Alongside national-level efforts our local groups also run inspirational projects focused on tackling issues in their areas, such as targeting unwanted supermarkets, promoting recycling and engaging young people.
From nationwide coalitions demonstrating widespread public support to lobbying decision makers face-to-face, from media coverage to street stalls, from letter writing to public meetings ­ each year we get the voices of tens of thousands of people heard right across the country.

Tasting success
Local groups were key to the success of many of our national campaigns this year.
Biofuels: Groups raised awareness of the threats posed by biofuels when they took our campaign into their communities. Through street campaigning they enabled local people to show their opposition to biofuels, writing to and lobbying MEPs in person.

Renewable energy: More than 140 groups took part in a day of action to build public support for a strong EU renewable energy target. And they brought together more than 1,300 local businesses and community groups to pressure the UK Government to commit to deliver on that target.

Demand Climate Change: Groups used our partnership with the makers of the climate change film The Age of Stupid to galvanise the public into taking action on climate solutions. Brent Friends of the Earth hosted a week of events reaching over 1,300 viewers at London's Tricycle Theatre, while the Leeds group held a sell-out screening to inspire the audience to get involved in their local campaigns.

""Friends of the Earth was a key element in the beyond-our-wildest dreams success of the UK release of our climate change film. They organised screenings, helped pack cinemas, generated loads of press attention and advised on our campaign strategy every step of the way.""
Director of The Age of Stupid, Franny Armstrong

COMMUNITIES at work
As well as playing a key role in our national and global campaigns, our local groups lead on solutions to protect and improve their local environment. Here's a sample of their amazing work.

Manchester Friends of the Earth Birmingham Friends of the Earth
Harrogate Friends of the Earth Jess Hurd/reportdigital.co.uk

Right: Thousands of local Friends of the Earth volunteers carry the flag for the planet

Transforming travel in Manchester: The group led a city-wide effort to encourage the people of Manchester to say yes to major investment in public transport. The significance of this work lies in the group's leadership of a coalition of unusual suspects ­ not just campaign groups but businesses and other networks across the Greater Manchester area ­ that gained significant media coverage through a range of innovative techniques. This hugely impressive work won Friends of the Earth's own Local Groups Campaign of the Year Award.

Greening Cornwall: Friends of the Earth Cornwall has been instrumental in the creation and development of climate-friendly parishes. Thanks to supporters across the county, the St Merryn group secured £50,000 for a community garden and allotment project, and is working with a local school on a renewable energy installation.
Shop local first: Banbridge and Mourne Friends of the Earth protected small and independent retailers threatened by plans to relocate a Tesco supermarket. Months of campaigning bore fruit when Northern Ireland's Environment Minister blocked the move on the grounds that it broke planning policy to protect town centres.

Faith and Change in Birmingham: The efforts of our Birmingham group to engage faith communities with the challenges of climate change received an Environment Agency communications award for best Community Engagement project this year. This inter-faith partnership has been working for two years with different communities to help them deliver environmental solutions at home, at work and in places of worship.
Multi-faith dialogue in Birmingham gives voice to climate solutions.

Empowering the next generation: Our local groups Youth and Education Network is bigger than ever before. This year 83 local group volunteers reached 2,500 young people via assemblies, stalls, curriculum-based lessons, workshops and talks. ""Great ­ fast moving and interactive,"" ""professional, friendly and encouraging,"" and ""very interesting and informative"" are just some of the reactions from young people who have attended our local groups events.

Car-free Harrogate: Our local group persuaded people to ditch their cars when they held their first Car-Free Day. Some roads showed as much as a 10 per cent drop in traffic.
Harrogate turns a corner with car-free day

Individual Champions Although much of our work at local level is carried out by organised local groups we do not underestimate the power of the individual. That well-timed visit to the MP, that brilliant letter to the local newspaper, or that flood of emails to the right person at the right time all help shift the debate in favour of the environment. Every year we inspire people to add their voices to our campaign and help build public pressure for change in a variety of ways. For example, we set up a network ­ Campaign Champions ­ of which there are now 2,300 getting heavily involved in our campaigns. So far they have taken action on the Big Ask, our Renewables Campaign and now Get Serious About CO2. Our email action lists and social networking sites are empowering more and more people to support our work. Over the next few years we'll be building even more engaging and innovative ways for individuals to express their desire for real and lasting solutions by taking action with us.

taking the green path



Welcome to our annual review for 2009-2010. It's been another remarkable year for Friends of the Earth, one that makes me proud to be part of this fantastic organisation.
Over the past 12 months we have achieved many things, and continue to make significant progress in preventing biodiversity loss and addressing climate change. This would not have been possible without your generous support.
Thanks to you, for example, renewable energy has made a big shift towards the mainstream, with homes and businesses now paid to produce their own electricity (page 14).

Thanks to you, we have made tremendous headway with limiting the amount of emissions from each local authority (page 4).
And because of your backing, the Government now acknowledges that action is needed to make livestock production more sustainable (page 8).
A major landmark was the climate summit in Copenhagen. It's no secret that this resulted in a disappointing Accord (page 6). But as someone who has been to several such conferences in the past, I know that we achieved a lot in the Danish capital.
As a result of us standing shoulder to shoulder with developing countries, their concerns have now shot up the international agenda. At Copenhagen, we campaigned for adequate finance for poorer countries to meet the challenge of climate change, and used our research to prove the recklessness of offsetting and carbon trading. Because of our campaigning, these issues are now on the negotiating table and key elements in the ongoing talks. Thanks to your support, any future climate agreement will be the better for what we did at Copenhagen.

The green path to a better future The following pages are a journey through many of the elements of our work, highlighting the impact we're making and what we've achieved on the way. I hope they give you a flavour of how our campaigns work together and an insight into how we work ­ from an idea, to political backing; from local activism, to widespread public support and media awareness.
You'll see that we value our independence and base our solutions on the latest science and research. And you'll read about the things that make us a truly unique organisation, such as our effectiveness at both grassroots and international levels, and our legal support to communities that are trying to protect their environment.
A new Government This is the first time we've had a change of Government since 1997. One challenge has been to convince it that even at a time of unprecedented public spending cuts, the environment remains a priority. On this front, we've had great results. For example, we have persuaded the Coalition to keep its commitment to a Renewable Heat Incentive (page 14) and create a Green Investment Bank (page 15).
And we continue to have respect in the corridors of power ­ so much so that Parliamentarians named us the UK's Best Environmental Campaigning Charity 2009.

What next? With the challenging economic circumstances, there's no doubt the year ahead is going to be tough for all sectors. In anticipation of this, we launched an urgent appeal ­ and the response has been fantastic. Thank you so much for your support, which will go a long way towards ensuring we can press ahead as planned with our campaigns.
The downturn, however, can be seen as an opportunity to rethink economics. Friends of the Earth will encourage investment in energy saving, renewables and other low-carbon technologies. This way the UK will not only begin to meet the challenge of climate change, but create hundreds of thousands of jobs and a thriving economy.
There are some big opportunities to make progress for the environment over the coming year. We'll be pressing for local carbon budgets to become law in the forthcoming Energy Bill, and for tough insulation standards in rented homes. Our research shows the latter will not only lift millions out of fuel poverty, but will cut carbon emissions and save a fortune in treating illnesses associated with poor housing (page 12 ).
David Cameron has said he wants this Government to be the greenest ever. With your support in 2011, we will show them the way ­ and continue to build momentum for a greener, fairer planet.

The world has already warmed by 1 degree since the Industrial Revolution. Beyond 2 degrees there is a far greater chance we will trigger runaway global warming. Friends of the Earth aims to stop average temperatures exceeding this figure by pushing for a strong and fair international agreement to slash carbon dioxide emissions ­ and securing action here in the UK.
cutting carbon locally

Get serious about co2 Councils have a big say in UK climate emissions ­ from how we heat and power our homes to how we get around. Our campaign aims to persuade councils to commit to cuts in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 40 per cent by 2020, in line with what scientists say is necessary.
More than 70 Friends of the Earth local volunteer groups have been gathering public support to inspire their councils to act.
We've shown how simple measures to drive down emissions will benefit people's lives. These include better insulation in our homes and businesses, which will cut energy bills, and better public transport and schemes to encourage walking and cycling.

We've been building alliances with a range of organisations including the National Federation of Women's Institutes, the Trades Union Congress, the Federation of Small Businesses and Unison.
More than 5 million people in England are now covered by strong local targets to cut CO2 emissions. Influential councils leading the way include Brighton, Bristol, Haringey, Manchester and York.
Momentum is building and in 2011 we will focus on the introduction of a nationwide scheme of local carbon budgets, to limit the amount of carbon each council can emit. This will ensure emissions come down steeply in every single local authority area, not just the ones already signed up to targets.

""Working with Friends of the Earth is a very natural thing. It's about grassroots campaigning, ordinary people putting pressure on politicians like me to do the right thing for the environment""
Neil Harrison, Councillor, Bristol

Spreading the message Friends of the Earth has an impressive track record of campaigning on climate change. Most recently we secured the introduction of the Climate Change Act of 2008, a world first that commits the UK to legally binding cuts in greenhouse gases.
Such is its impact that other countries want to follow our lead and introduce their own legislation.

This year we delivered seminars with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of Energy and Climate Change to promote the Act across Europe. This is helping to generate support for climate legislation, and complements the campaigns of our sister groups in Europe. New laws are expected to be agreed in 2011 in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Ireland.

Councils can influence up to 80 per cent of carbon emissions in their area ­ they could slash emissions by insulating homes and businesses, encouraging better public transport and installing renewable energy.

How we're making a difference
In Leeds ­ as in many areas around the country ­ we have been campaigning for the council to commit to big emissions reduction targets. The campaign included packed public screenings of the climate change film, The Age of Stupid, attended by councillors and business leaders. Clearly the message hit home, as Leeds City Council passed a motion to reduce emissions by at least 40 per cent by 2020. We and other groups are now working closely with them to develop a climate change strategy. Among the proposals are a £30 million scheme to roll out energy-efficiency measures in homes across the city.

copenhagen and the bigger picture

international action Climate change needs action on the world stage as well as at home, and Friends of the Earth is campaigning for a strong and fair global agreement on tackling greenhouse gas emissions.
In 2009 our international work focused on the climate talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, reflecting huge expectations from both the public and politicians.
We sent a small group of experts to the Danish capital as part of the Friends of the Earth International delegation. Hundreds of UK supporters went too, joining others from our 77 member groups for a peaceful demonstration through the city.
Those two weeks in December showed Friends of the Earth at its best, with supporters, volunteers and staff working together. Our strategy was to apply pressure to achieve a meaningful agreement, and head off compromises by a combination of advocacy, support for developing countries, public pressure and media work.

Campaigning Our campaigners inside the talks often worked late into the night, monitoring every development. It meant we could respond quickly to emerging information and feed back into the talks via contacts in delegations.
We stood shoulder to shoulder with developing countries, sharing information with them, organising press conferences and media briefings to make sure their concerns were heard by more powerful states and the general public.
We reported what was happening on the inside track at the conference via a regular blog on our website.
Legal expertise Our team included lawyers who analysed draft agreements as they emerged. This exposed false solutions and loopholes in emissions targets, alerted negotiators to amendments that were needed, and helped build momentum for a strong and fair agreement at the talks.

activism We supported events promoting alternative solutions to the climate crisis, and organised debates with leading international thinkers. Back in the UK, staff worked with our team in Copenhagen to mobilise over 1,000 people to take critical actions every day of the talks, such as emailing influential countries to persuade them to change their positions.
impact Our work in Copenhagen has helped make poorer countries and the billions of people most affected by climate change a key issue in ongoing climate negotiations. We were the leading critical voice on carbon trading, whereby rights to emit carbon dioxide are bought and sold. And we exposed the failings of offsetting, where rich countries pay for low-carbon projects in poorer countries instead of tackling their own emissions. As a result both issues are now central to negotiations and will have to be resolved for real progress to be made.

6

beyond copenhagen Despite the high expectations, the Copenhagen negotiations produced a hugely disappointing voluntary Accord that offers insufficient emissions cuts and inadequate finance for tackling climate change and its effects.
Throughout 2010, however, we continued to be a major presence at climate talks around the world, including Bonn, Germany, and Cancun, Mexico.
We supported Friends of the Earth International at the Cochabamba People's Summit on Climate Change, held in Bolivia. This brought together 35,000 people ­ including official delegations from 47 countries, representatives of people affected by climate change, scientists and campaign groups ­ to formulate the

developing world's response to the Copenhagen Accord.
Following the summit, Friends of the Earth was invited to join a private meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to help present the findings. This was unprecedented and is a measure of the influence Friends of the Earth has on the global stage.
Our campaigning in Cancun further highlighted the need for emissions cuts consistent with the science, and for more money for developing countries to tackle climate change. The outcome of the talks, though weak, has kept the UN process alive and is something to build on. We will continue to push hard for a strong and fair agreement as we head towards the next major UN summit in South Africa, at the end of 2011.

Biodiversity loss

Along with climate change, the destruction of the natural world is the greatest environmental danger we face. Deforestation, pollution, industrial agriculture and over-fishing are not only contributing to the fastest rates of extinction since the dinosaurs, but threaten the natural life-support systems on which we all depend. Friends of the Earth aims to galvanise public concern over the loss of plants, animals and their habitats in order to halt this destruction.

PROTECTING THE NATURAL WORLD

soy and the food chain The main thrust of our biodiversity work this year has been the Food Chain campaign. This exposes the hidden link between intensive livestock farming in the UK, the destruction of habitats and climate change.
Factory-farmed meat and dairy require enormous amounts of soy for animal feed. And South America's rainforests and grasslands ­ giant, natural lungs that turn carbon dioxide into oxygen ­ are being cleared to grow it. If current trends continue, cattle ranchers and soy farmers alone will destroy 40 per cent of Amazon rainforest by 2050 ­ home to nearly a third of the world's species.
We are campaigning for a shift away from factory livestock production towards more sustainable methods of farming. We have been working closely with farmers to test our solutions. And we commissioned research from the Royal Agricultural College which showed it is possible to have a thriving, sustainable meat and dairy farming sector using home-grown feeds instead of imported soy.
We have also been encouraging retailers to source soy-free meat and dairy, and work with their supply chains to develop alternative feeds.
We have worked at a local and national level to get public support for our campaign. This included backing

from some of the country's leading chefs and ""Livestock"", an all-star comedy night at London's Hammersmith Apollo, which drew an amazing list of talent, including Marcus Brigstocke, Stephen Merchant, Dan Antopolski, Jimmy Carr and Francesca Martinez.
An incredible range of organisations, representing millions of people, are now working with us. These include WWF, RSPB, the Soil Association, New Economics Foundation, Compassion in World Farming and the National Heart Forum. And we have had a tremendous impact in pushing food sustainability up the public and political agenda.
""I was shocked to find out just how much a Sunday roast can cost our planet under the factory farming system""
Robert Flello MP

Peter Hayes

The MOovement A major focus of our work was the Sustainable Livestock Bill ­ legislation we drafted which was adopted by Robert Flello MP and put before Parliament. The Bill included measures that would help UK farmers swap imported soy animal feed for homegrown alternatives, tackle food waste, and put more sustainable food in schools, hospitals and care homes.
The Bill's success or failure rested on a crucial Parliamentary vote in November. We launched an innovative campaign called the MOOvement to capture the public's imagination and to persuade MPs to vote for the Bill. Our moovement viral videos featuring people dressed as cows were seen by hundreds of thousands on YouTube and our publicity stunts and actions turned heads across the country.
We generated fantastic press coverage and many politicians called this the best-supported Bill campaign they've known for a long time.
But despite widespread support we fell short of the necessary backing of 100 MPs on the day of the vote ­ a Friday when many had returned to their constituencies.

8

what next? We have a strong platform to build on. It was a tremendous achievement to get an MP to adopt our Bill in the first place. The MOOvement employed some brilliant tactics to raise awareness and gain support. More than 60,000 people took action in support of the campaign and that is not the kind of number decision makers can ignore for long. And we have allies both inside and outside of Parliament.
Crucially, the Government now acknowledges that action is needed to make livestock production more sustainable. We intend to make sure this translates into a firm commitment to reduce our reliance on South American soy for animal feed. We'll do this by continuing to work with supportive MPs ­ and pushing for real action for a greener farming system and more sustainable healthy diets for all. And we'll be making sure our MOOvement supporters have every opportunity to help.

paraguay A crucial part of our Food Chain campaign is working with communities affected by soy, ensuring both political and practical approaches to a solution.
Industrial soy production is not only destroying forests and contributing to climate change ­ it's ruining lives too. Pesticide spraying of soy has increased rapidly in recent years, leading to health problems and, in some cases, deaths. This was highlighted in the film Killing Fields, which we commissioned and used to call for urgent action by governments in Europe and South America.
One of the places worst affected by industrial-scale soy is Paraguay. Some of the eastern regions of the country have as much as 30 per cent soy coverage. As soy plantations expand, small farmers are squeezed out and more forest and grasslands are turned over to agribusiness.

""People in Europe don't know what's happening here. I'd like them to come and witness the spraying""

Biodiversity loss

biofuels and sustainable resource use

Environmental legislation and enforcement in the country is weak, and regularly ignored by powerful landowners. But in partnership with our sister group Friends of the Earth Paraguay (Sobrevivencia), we are working with communities to halt the chainsaws and the march of soy. We have been running workshops to educate local people about their rights, how to spot common breaches of the law and how to report these to the authorities.
We have been helping communities find ways of making a living that gets the most from the environment, yet protects it, such as diversifying crops, preserving traditional seed varieties and using organic farming techniques.
We have also developed groundbreaking work training local people to use GPS to record environmental crimes. Impacts such as deforestation can then be confirmed through satellite imaging.
Another important tool is a local radio station, which has been one of the most effective ways of telling people what's really going on in the area. It's also helped to engage young people, who have been making programmes for the station.
Our work in the Luz Bella area has already resulted in the Paraguayan Environment Ministry launching eight

investigations into possible breaches of the law. These include deforestation.
In 2011 we plan to expand this work, to protect the rights and improve the livelihoods of many more indigenous communities across Paraguay.
biofuels: the problem Biofuels are another significant driver of forest destruction and biodiversity loss. Biofuels have been promoted as a green fuel because they are made from plants ­ renewable resources that absorb carbon dioxide while they grow.
However, research shows that growing crops for fuel increases demand for land which leads to more rainforests being destroyed in countries like Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia. And a report for the European Commission found some biofuels can lead to four times more carbon dioxide polluting the atmosphere than equivalent fossil fuels.
Yet European Union and UK targets for renewable energy in transport, heat and electricity are increasing biofuel use. The UK even plans to subsidise new palm oil power stations.
Friends of the Earth is campaigning to halt damaging biofuels targets, advocating that the UK and EU should instead tackle the root causes of carbon dioxide emissions. In response to a report commissioned by Friends of the Earth in coalition with eight other organisations, the UK Government is now urging the European Commission to rethink biofuels policy.

We have also persuaded the International Finance Corporation to suspend funding for palm oil investments and caused a misleading palm oil advert to be banned in the UK.
Through grassroots and national work, we have helped stop new palm oil power stations in Avonmouth, London's Southall and Portland in Dorset.
Over the coming year we will support groups campaigning against similar plants, and work at a national and European level to promote alternative solutions to our energy and transport needs.
Waste and resources Addressing the amount that countries consume is key to restoring a healthy planet. This is especially true in the richer world where countries consume much more than their fair share of global resources.
We've been working to convince European decision makers of the importance of measuring, then reducing, our resource use. Our work has helped make resource efficiency one of the main priorities of the new EU Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik in 2011, and we are frequently called in to contribute to expert discussions in the European Commission and Parliament.
We produced a briefing, Measuring Our Resource Use: A vital tool in creating a resource-efficient EU ­ which has been extensively distributed at EU level. The issue was discussed in depth at a successful conference of key decision makers and politicans that we organised in the European Parliament.

Growing demand for biofuels is destroying rainforests in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil.



Reuse and recycling Our campaign in 2003 led to the introduction of doorstep recycling in the UK. But more needs to be done. We need more sustainable waste treatment, including increased waste prevention, reuse and recycling instead of incineration.
We have been working to highlight what Britain currently wastes, including a study which reveals that the country needlessly throws away £650 million of recyclable materials every year.
We have had some success in Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government agreed to Friends of the Earth Cymru's demand to commit to a waste reduction target of 65 per cent by 2050.

We have also supported numerous community-led campaigns against waste incinerators which create greenhouse gases and toxic emissions. A number of incinerator proposals have been withdrawn as a result.
We move into 2011 with a golden opportunity to influence the next decade of waste policy in the UK, as the Government reviews its recycling targets. We will be pushing for a 70 per cent target by 2020, in line with best practice in Europe and well above the current aim of 50 per cent.

Telford's burning issue
Telford is just one example of several successful campaigns against incinerators in 2009-2010. We liaised with councillors, held public meetings to explore the issues and helped residents submit planning objections.

Crucially, we got the support of two local MPs and worked closely with Telford PAIN (People Against Incineration Now) to propose alternative solutions. The council opted to invest in recycling and reject the incinerator.

Environmental justice
Friends of the Earth believes the environment is for all of us ­ and that everyone has the right to a healthy place to live and a fair share of the world's resources.

Millions of households cannot afford to keep warm in winter, often because their homes are poorly insulated. We are campaigning for minimum energy-efficiency standards in the rental sector.
(The photo is posed by a model.)

FROM PEOPLE TO PLANET

Friends of the Earth supports people in the UK and around the world, so they have a genuine say in what happens where they live. We do this through individual legal cases and campaigning for better laws affecting communities and their environment.
rights in paraguay In Paraguay, for example, you have already seen how we have been supporting people whose lives are being ruined by the march of soy plantations into farmland, grassland and forests (page 9).
greener homes Environmental justice not only brings benefits for people ­ but for the wider environment and the economy. It is also part of any credible strategy to tackle climate change.
In the UK, for example, we launched work to tackle the energy efficiency of one of the worst performing areas of housing ­ private rented homes. This sector accounts for more than 10 per cent of housing in England. Nearly one in five private tenants live in fuel poverty, meaning they spend more than a tenth of household income trying to keep warm. Fuel poverty is unacceptable in 21st century Britain, and our campaign is seeking legally-binding standards of fuel efficiency in private rented homes. This would benefit 600,000 people.

Tenants would be protected from high fuel bills. Jobs would be created insulating and improving homes. It would cut carbon equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road, and there would be a reduction of illnesses associated with living in cold homes ­ which our research says would save the National Health Service £600 million a year.
We have made some early progress with a Government commitment to address the private rented sector in its forthcoming Energy Bill. However, the details are yet to emerge and in 2011, we will be focusing our efforts on ensuring it will deliver both for people and the planet.
Rights & Justice Centre At the heart of our environmental justice work is our unique Rights & Justice Centre. We are the only national environmental organisation providing free legal advice and representation for those who need to use the law to protect their communities and the environment.
""I found myself out of my depth at the wrong end of an injunction from a major multinational. At my moment of greatest need, Friends of the Earth's lawyers were there to make sure that my rights were not abused and justice was done""
Shlomo Dowen

We support those worst affected by environmental problems, who often struggle to get their opinions heard. Acting on behalf of community group Fight the Flights, for example, we challenged Newham Borough Council's decision to allow the London City airport to almost double the number of take offs and landings. The case went to Court in November 2010 and we are awaiting the judgment.
We also work on cases that will bring about a change in law to benefit many communities and the environment. For example, Friends of the Earth won a landmark Freedom of Information judgment on behalf of Nottinghamshire resident Shlomo Dowen.
Shlomo was trying to get information on the contract between his council and the huge waste company Veolia. Veolia tried to prevent this with an injunction. We acted for Shlomo in the High Court ­ which ruled in our favour, throwing out Veolia's case. The judgment sets an important precedent for people who want information about how councils are spending their money.
Power up 2010 Empowerment is an important part of our environmental justice work with communities and individuals. Our annual Power Up residential weekend, where we train people on community rights and campaigning tools, is the flagship

12

of this work. This year we brought together a diverse group of 50 people to learn more about community rights and environmental justice.
The weekend blended some familiar ingredients ­ workshops on how to use the planning system and important legal tools such as Freedom of Information ­ with some new additions, such as community film-making.
Planning As well as working with communities, we are making progress at a national level. The Government has recently introduced a new planning system for large projects such as power stations, airports and large incinerators. This new system makes it much harder for people to influence what is built in their area. Not only does the developer run the public consultation, the final decision is not taken by the local council or Government Minister but by an unaccountable, unelected body called the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC). We advocated that decisions on

such large controversial developments must be made by a democratically accountable body or individual. The Coalition Government now has plans to scrap the IPC and ensure that the relevant Government Minister takes the final decision on big developments. Some projects, however, are already in the planning system, such as an incinerator in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales. This would be one of the biggest in the UK, taking waste from all over Wales.
Like many areas chosen for potentially controversial projects, Merthyr Tydfil is an area of high unemployment that's already suffered environmental degradation. It has the UK's largest open-cast coal mine on its doorstep, and the incinerator would

exacerbate existing economic, social and environmental problems. Friends of the Earth is working with local people to raise awareness of the issue and to help them challenge the application.
In 2011 we will continue to support communities affected by bad environmental decisions, and work with them to get their opinions heard. This includes working on individual cases, and pressing national Government for a fairer planning system.

Making a difference on the ground
As well as addressing policy, we have also been tackling planning issues on the ground. For example, in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, we worked with the local Chamber of Commerce to oppose a gigantic, out-of-town Tesco store, successfully arguing that it would have a detrimental impact on a thriving town centre. And in Westbury, Wiltshire, we helped

persuade the Government to reject plans for a bypass through the Wellhead Valley, just below the famous White Horse. Years of campaigning and new planning applications from the local council had forced the scheme to a public inquiry, where the planning inspector agreed that the landscape impact was too high.

Economy
Friends of the Earth aims to change the way the UK economy works so that it respects the planet's natural limits and meets the challenge of tackling climate change.
A green route to recovery

Hundreds of thousands of jobs could be created building a low-carbon economy. Councils alone could create 70,000 jobs in England and Wales by insulating homes and businesses and fitting green energy systems to buildings.

We are pushing for investment in green technologies and a reduction in energy demand to make our economy more sustainable, create new business opportunities and generate thousands of jobs.
Though the year was dominated by recession and talk of spending cuts, we maintained that this was a major opportunity to promote low-carbon measures and build a greener economy.
For example, we commissioned research showing that councils alone could create at least 70,000 jobs across England and Wales by insulating homes and businesses and fitting green energy technology to buildings. As well as the obvious social benefits, this would save energy and radically reduce emissions.

Boosting renewable energy Friends of the Earth believes the UK can meet future energy needs with demand efficiencies and a mix of renewables. This is supported by the Government's own research. In Wales, we helped persuade the Welsh Assembly Government to support a major expansion in renewable energy generation. And the UK as a whole made an important step forward with the introduction of feed-in tariffs (FITs) where homes, businesses and communities get paid for generating green electricity.
This was a fantastic achievement for Friends of the Earth and its supporters, who led the campaign for FITs.
There's a lot more to do, however. The current scheme demands only 2 per cent of UK electricity should be produced from small-scale renewables by 2020. Along with others, we're pushing to see this amount tripled.

We also need to encourage other forms of green energy generation ­ not just electricity. We have therefore been campaigning for the Government to introduce payments for people who produce their own renewable heat, from such things as solar panels for hot water, ground source heat pumps and animal waste on farms. And in 2011 a Renewable Heat Incentive to do just that will be launched.
MPs supporting our renewable heat campaign. From left: Caroline Lucas, Zac Goldsmith and Alan Whitehead.

Green job creation

Friends of the Earth research shows a green economy can create thousands of jobs ­ and this is being borne out on the ground. In Teesside, when the Government announced a massive roll-out of offshore wind in the North Sea, we identified an opportunity to deliver a crucial economic and environmental boost to a region reeling from the closure of the local Corus iron and steel plant. We submitted a detailed briefing to the

region's MPs, calling for investment in local industry instead of sourcing components from overseas (as had happened with the London Array wind farm). The MPs' subsequent report made substantial reference to these opportunities and Corus has since announced over 200 jobs will be created in building the structures that secure turbines to the sea bed.

Other important wins include:
Carbon pricing Research by our economics team and academics led the Government to make changes to the way it prices carbon. The cost of carbon is one of the factors that Governments take into account when considering new developments, such as power stations, where the economic cost of pollution has to be factored in. The changes are great news for the climate because the new price for carbon is higher and rises steeply over time. This makes it harder for Ministers to give the green light to polluting projects such as new runways.

A Green Investment Bank In the March 2010 Budget the Government announced it would set up a Green Investment Bank to bring billions of pounds of private investment into low-carbon technology. Friends of the Earth had worked tirelessly with businesses, investors and other groups to push for such a commitment. The Bank will be a core element of a green economy.

Community
The work of our local volunteer groups
Friends of the Earth works at a community level across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Often this is through more than 220 local volunteer groups. This is one of our strengths as a campaigning organisation. It means we can bring about change at a grassroots level as well as build support for our campaigns on a national and international stage. 16

There have been many creative campaigns from our local groups. Here's just a taste of the wonderful things they've been doing:
grow to eat well Grow to Eat Well is a scheme running in Portsmouth schools, teaching students and families about the benefits of growing their own food. Working with a number of other organisations, Portsmouth Friends of the Earth successfully applied to the Big Lottery Local Food Fund for a grant of £250,000 to get going. The aim is to roll out the scheme to 35 schools in the next three years.
no to plastic bags Walsall Friends of the Earth formed bag-making group Walsall Saddlebags to raise awareness of the impact of plastic bags. They engaged a diverse range of communities. This included

working with the Aaina Asian women's centre and the local primary school to demonstrate the need to reduce the use of plastic bags.
derby day Derby Friends of the Earth, with local residents, has successfully opposed not one but two proposed incinerators in the city. Their extensive campaigning included proposals for alternative solutions to incineration, and is a great example of how Friends of the Earth groups can work with affected communities to oppose environmentally damaging proposals.
northern lights Thanks to your support, Friends of the Earth's groups in the North East have continued to deliver a range of environmental benefits. In Alnwick the local group organised a season of green films at a local cinema, and public events included an Environmental Question Time.

In North Tyneside, the local group joined forces with the council to stage the second annual Big Green Seaside Station Day, promoting sustainable living and transport to over 2,000 people. Darlington Friends of the Earth launched Gro Zone, working with community groups, the council and Groundwork to turn wasteland into temporary growing spaces for local people.
young people Local groups also have a Youth and Education Network that works with young people. Run entirely by volunteers, this enables local people to deliver educational events and activities, and visit schools to foster the next generation of environmentalists.

Girlguiding UK
Last year saw the conclusion of the Be a Climate Champion project between Friends of the Earth and Girlguiding UK. We asked more than 1,400 Brownies and Guides to test a selection of green solutions. The idea was to unearth the barriers preventing people living climate-friendly lifestyles, and the findings formed the basis of a report that helped inform our Get Serious About CO2 campaign. We also ran a competition, asking the girls what they would say to world leaders about the climate. Three winners were selected for a weekend in London, where they joined a huge march in the run-up to the Copenhagen climate summit and were interviewed on stage as part of the main rally.

A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

foreword

Of all the sectors of a modern economic system, the one that appears to be getting the maximum attention currently is the energy sector. While the recent increase in oil prices certainly requires some temporary measures to tide over the problem of increasing costs of oil consumption particularly for oil importing countries, there are several reasons why the focus must now shift towards longer term solutions. First and

foremost, of course, are the growing uncertainties related to oil imports both in respect of quantities and prices, but there are several other factors that require a totally new approach to planning energy supply and consumption in the future. Perhaps, the most crucial of these considerations is the threat of global climate change which has been caused overwhelmingly in recent decades by human actions that have resulted in the build up of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere.

Impacts of climate change are diverse and serious, and unless the emissions of GHGs are effectively mitigated these would threaten to become far more serious over time. There is now, therefore, a renewed interest in renewable sources of energy, because by creating and using low carbon substitutes to fossil fuels, we may be able to reduce emissions of GHGs significantly while at the same time ensuring economic growth and development and the enhancement of human welfare across the world. As it happens, there are major disparities in the levels of consumption of energy across the world, with some countries using large quantities per capita and others being deprived of any sources of modern energy forms. Solutions in the future would, therefore, also have to come to grips with the reality of lack of access to modern forms of energy for hundreds of millions of people. For instance, there are 1.6 billion people in the world who have no access to electricity. Households, in which these people reside, therefore, lack a single electric bulb for lighting purposes, and whatever substitutes they use provide inadequate lighting and environmental pollution, since these include inefficient lighting devices using various types of oil or the burning of candles.

Future policies can be guided by the consideration of different scenarios that can be linked to specific developments. This publication advocates the need for something in the nature of an energy revolution. This is a view that is now shared by several people across the world, and it is also expected that energy plans would be based on a clear assessment of specific scenarios related to clearly identified policy initiatives and technological developments. This edition of Energy [R]evolution Scenarios provides a detailed analysis of the energy efficiency potential and choices in the transport sector. The material presented in this publication provides a useful basis for considering specific policies and developments that would be of value not only to the world but for different countries as they attempt to meet the global challenge confronting them. The work carried out in the following pages is comprehensive and rigorous, and even those who may not agree with the analysis presented would, perhaps, benefit from a deep study of the underlying assumptions that are linked with specific energy scenarios for the future.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK
introduction
""NOW IS THE TIME TO COMMIT TO A TRULY SECURE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE ­ A FUTURE BUILT ON CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE CREATION OF MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS.""



Energy supply has become a subject of major universal concern. High and volatile oil and gas prices, threats to a secure and stable supply and not least climate change have all pushed it high up the international agenda. In order to avoid dangerous climate change, global CO2 emissions must peak no later than 2015 and rapidly decrease after that. The technology to do this is available. The renewables industry is ready for take off and opinion polls show that the majority of people support this move. There are no real technical obstacles in the way of an Energy [R]evolution, all that is missing is political support. But we have no time to waste. To achieve an emissions peak by 2015 and a net reduction afterwards, we need to start rebuilding the energy sector now.

An overwhelming consensus of scientific opinion now agrees that climate change is happening, is caused in large part by human activities (such as burning fossil fuels), and if left unchecked will have disastrous consequences. Furthermore, there is solid scientific evidence that we should act now. This is reflected in the conclusions, published in 2007, of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN institution of more than 1,000 scientists providing advice to policy makers.
The effects of climate change have in fact already begun. In 2008, the melting of the Arctic ice sheet almost matched the record set on September 16, 2007. The fact that this has now happened two years in a row reinforces the strong decreasing trend in the amount of summertime ice observed over the past 30 years.

In response to this threat, the Kyoto Protocol has committed its signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from their 1990 levels by 2008-2012. The Kyoto signatories are currently negotiating the second phase of the agreement, covering the period from 2013-2017. Time is quickly running out. Signatory countries agreed a negotiating `mandate', known as the Bali Action Plan, which they must complete with a final agreement on the second Kyoto commitment period by the end of 2009. By choosing renewable energy and energy efficiency, developing countries can virtually stabilise their CO2 emissions, whilst at the same time increasing energy consumption through economic growth. OECD countries, on the other hand, will have to reduce their emissions by up to 80%. The Energy [R]evolution concept provides a practical blueprint on how to put this into practice.
Renewable energy, combined with the smart use of energy, can deliver at least half of the world's energy needs by 2050. This report, `Energy [R]evolution: A Sustainable World Energy Outlook', shows that it is economically beneficial to cut global CO2 emissions by over 50% within the next 42 years. It also concludes that a massive uptake of renewable energy sources is technically and economically possible. Wind power alone could produce about 40 times more power than it does today, and total global renewable energy generation could quadruple by then.
renewed energy [r]evolution
This is the second edition of the Energy [R]evolution. Since we published the first edition in January 2007, we have experienced an overwhelming wave of support from governments, the renewables industry and non-governmental organisations. Since than we have broken down the global regional scenarios into country specific plans for Canada, the USA, Brazil, the European Community, Japan and Australia, among many others.
More and more countries are seeing the environmental and economic benefits provided by renewable energy. The Brent crude oil price was at $55 per barrel when we launched the first Energy [R]evolution report. Since than the price has only headed in one direction - upwards! By mid-2008 it had reached a peak of over $140 per barrel and has subsequently stabilised at around $100. Other fuel prices have also shot up. Coal, gas and uranium have doubled or even tripled in the same timeframe. By contrast, most renewable energy sources don't need any fuel. Once installed, they deliver energy independently from the global energy markets and at predictable prices. Every day that another community switches to renewable energy is an independence day.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario concludes that the restructuring of the global electricity sector requires an investment of $14.7 trillion up to 2030. This compares with $11.3 trillion under the Reference Scenario based on International Energy Agency projections. While the average annual investment required to implement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario would need just under 1% of global GDP, it would lower fuel costs by 25% - saving an annual amount in the range of $750 billion.

In fact, the additional costs for coal power generation alone from today up to 2030 under the Reference Scenario could be as high as US$ 15.9 billion: this would cover the entire investment needed in renewable and cogeneration capacity to implement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. These renewable sources will produce energy without any further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs for coal and gas will continue to be a burden on national and global economies.
global energy scenario
The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) and Greenpeace International have produced this global energy scenario as a practical blueprint for how to urgently meet CO2 reduction targets and secure an affordable energy supply on the basis of steady worldwide economic development. Both of these goals are possible at the same time. The urgent need for change in the energy sector means that this scenario is based only on proven and sustainable technologies, such as renewable energy sources and efficient decentralised cogeneration. It therefore excludes so-called `CO2-free coal power plants', which are not in fact CO2 free and would create another burden in trying to store the gas under the surface of the Earth with unknown consequences. For multiple safety and environmental reasons, nuclear energy is also excluded.
Commissioned from the Department of Systems Analysis and Technology Assessment (Institute of Technical Thermodynamics) at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), the report develops a global sustainable energy pathway up to 2050. The future potential for renewable energy sources has been assessed with input from all sectors of the renewables industry around the world. The new Energy [R]evolution Scenario also takes a closer look for the first time at the transport sector, including future technologies and how to implement energy efficiency.
The energy supply scenarios adopted in this report, which extend beyond and enhance projections made by the International Energy Agency, have been calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model. The demand side projection has been developed by the Ecofys consultancy to take into account the future potential for energy efficiency measures. This study envisages an ambitious development pathway for the exploitation of energy efficiency potential, focused on current best practice as well as technologies available in the future. The result is that under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, worldwide final energy demand can be reduced by 38% in 2050 compared to the Reference Scenario.

the potential for renewable energy
The good news is that the global market for renewables is booming. Decades of technical progress have seen renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines, solar photovoltaic panels, biomass power plants, solar thermal collectors and many others move steadily into the mainstream. The global market for renewable energy is growing dramatically; in 2007 its turnover was over aUS$ 70 billion, almost twice as high as the previous year. The time window for making the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, however, is still relatively short. Within the next decade many of the existing power plants in the OECD countries will come to the end of their technical lifetime and will need to be replaced. But a decision taken to construct a coal or gas power plant today will result in the production of CO2 emissions and dependency on the resource and its future costs lasting until 2050.
The power industry and utilities need to take more responsibility because today's investment decisions will define the energy supply of the next generation. We strongly believe that this should be the `solar generation'. Politicians from the industrialised world urgently need to rethink their energy strategy, while the developing world should learn from past mistakes and build economies on the strong foundations of a sustainable energy supply.
Renewable energy could more than double its share of the world's energy supply - reaching up to 30% by 2030. All that is lacking is the political will to promote its large scale deployment in all sectors at a global level, coupled with far reaching energy efficiency measures. By 2030 about half of global electricity could come from renewable energies.
The future of renewable energy development will strongly depend on political choices made by both individual governments and the international community. At the same time strict technical standards will ensure that only the most efficient fridges, heating systems, computers and vehicles will be on sale. Consumers have a right to buy products that don't increase their energy bills and won't destroy the climate.
In this report we have also expanded the time horizon for the Energy [R]evolution concept beyond 2050, to see when we could phase out fossil fuels entirely. Once the pathway of this scenario has been implemented, renewable energy could provide all global energy needs by 2090. A more radical scenario ­ which takes the advanced projections of the renewables industry into account ­ could even phase out coal by 2050. Dangerous climate change might force us to accelerate the development of renewables faster. We believe that this would be possible, but to achieve it more resources must go into research and development. Climate change and scarcity of fossil fuel resources puts our world as we know it at risk; we must start to think the unthinkable. To tap into the fast potential for renewables and to phase out fossil fuels as soon as possible are amongst the most pressing tasks for the next generation of engineers and scientists.

implementing the energy [r]evolution
Business as usual is not an option for future generations. The Reference Scenario based on the IEA's `World Energy Outlook 2007' projection would almost double global CO2 emissions by 2050 and the climate would heat up by well over 2°C. This would have catastrophic consequences for the environment, the economy and human society. In addition, it is worth remembering that the former chief economist of the World Bank, Sir Nicholas Stern, pointed out clearly in his landmark report that the countries which invest in energy saving technologies and renewable energies today will be the economic winners of tomorrow.
As Stern emphasised, inaction will be much more expensive in the long run. We therefore call on all decision makers yet again to make this vision a reality. The world cannot afford to stick to the `business as usual' energy development path: relying on fossil fuels, nuclear energy and other outdated technologies. Renewable energy can and will play a leading role in our collective energy future. For the sake of a sound environment, political stability and thriving economies, now is the time to commit to a truly secure and sustainable energy future ­ a future built on clean technologies, economic development and the creation of millions of new jobs.

climate threats and climate solutions
Global climate change caused by the relentless build-up of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere is already disrupting ecosystems, resulting in about 150,000 additional deaths each year. An average global warming of 2°C threatens millions of people with an increased risk of hunger, malaria, flooding and water shortages. If rising temperatures are to be kept within acceptable limits then we need to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This makes both environmental and economic sense. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by using fossil fuels for energy and transport.

climate change and security of supply
Spurred by recent large increases in the price of oil, the issue of security of supply is now at the top of the energy policy agenda. One reason for these price increases is the fact that supplies of all fossil fuels ­ oil, gas and coal ­ are becoming scarcer and more expensive to produce. The days of `cheap oil and gas' are coming to an end. Uranium, the fuel for nuclear power, is also a finite resource. By contrast, the reserves of renewable energy that are technically accessible globally are large enough to provide about six times more power than the world currently consumes - forever.
Renewable energy technologies vary widely in their technical and economic maturity, but there are a range of sources which offer increasingly attractive options. These include wind, biomass, photovoltaic, solar thermal, geothermal, ocean and hydroelectric power. Their common feature is that they produce little or no greenhouse gases, and rely on virtually inexhaustible natural sources for their `fuel'. Some of these technologies are already competitive. Their economics will further improve as they develop technically, as the price of fossil fuels continues to rise and as their saving of carbon dioxide emissions is given a monetary value.

At the same time there is enormous potential for reducing our consumption of energy, while providing the same level of energy services. This study details a series of energy efficiency measures which together can substantially reduce demand in industry, homes, business and services.
Although nuclear power produces little carbon dioxide, there are multiple threats to people and the environment from its operations. These include the risks and environmental damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation, the unsolved problem of nuclear waste and the potential hazard of a serious accident. The nuclear option is therefore discounted in this analysis. The solution to our future energy needs lies instead in greater use of renewable energy sources for both heat and power.
the energy [r]evolution
The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy revolution. At the core of this revolution will be a change in the way that energy is produced, distributed and consumed.
the five key principles behind this shift will be to:
· Implement renewable solutions, especially through decentralised energy systems
· Respect the natural limits of the environment
· Phase out dirty, unsustainable energy sources
· Create greater equity in the use of resources
· Decouple economic growth from the consumption of fossil fuels
Decentralised energy systems, where power and heat are produced close to the point of final use, avoid the current waste of energy during conversion and distribution. They will be central to the Energy [R]evolution, as will the need to provide electricity to the two billion people around the world to whom access is presently denied.
Two scenarios up to the year 2050 are outlined in this report. The Reference Scenario is based on the Reference Scenario published by the International Energy Agency in World Energy Outlook 2007, extrapolated forward from 2030. Compared to the 2004 IEA projections, World Energy Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007) assumes a slightly higher average annual growth rate of world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 3.6%, instead of 3.2%, over the period 20052030. At the same time, WEO 2007 expects final energy consumption in 2030 to be 4% higher than in WEO 2004.
China and India are expected to grow faster than other regions, followed by the Developing Asia group of countries, Africa and the Transition Economies (mainly the former Soviet Union). The OECD share of global purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted GDP will decrease from 55% in 2005 to 29% by 2050.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target for worldwide carbon dioxide emissions to be reduced by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050, with per capita emissions reduced to less than 1.3 tonnes per year. This is necessary if the increase in global temperature is to

remain below +2°C. A second objective is the global phasing out of nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, the scenario is characterised by significant efforts to fully exploit the large potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all cost-effective renewable energy sources are accessed for both heat and electricity generation, as well as the production of sustainable bio fuels.
Today, renewable energy sources account for 13% of the world's primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used in the heat sector, is the main renewable energy source. The share of renewable energies for electricity generation is 18%. The contribution of renewables to heat supply is around 24%, to a large extent accounted for by traditional uses such as collected firewood. About 80% of the primary energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario describes a development pathway which turns the present situation into a sustainable energy supply through the following measures:
· Exploitation of the existing large energy efficiency potentials will ensure that primary energy demand increases only slightly - from the current 474,900 PJ/a (2005) to 480,860 PJ/a in 2050, compared to 867,700 PJ/a in the Reference Scenario. This dramatic reduction is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources in the overall energy supply system, for compensating the phasing out of nuclear energy and for reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.
· The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP) also improves the supply system's energy conversion efficiency, increasingly using natural gas and biomass. In the long term, the decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources limits the further expansion of CHP.
· The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy utilisation. By 2050, around 77% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources (including large hydro). A capacity of 9,100 GW will produce 28,600 TWh/a renewable electricity in 2050.
· In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will increase to 70% by 2050. Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal.
· Before sustainable bio fuels are introduced in the transport sector, the existing large efficiency potentials have to be exploited. As biomass is mainly committed to stationary applications, the production of bio fuels is limited by the availability of sustainable raw materials. Electric vehicles powered by renewable energy sources, will play an increasingly important role from 2020 onwards.
· By 2050, 56% of primary energy demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.
To achieve an economically attractive growth of renewable energy sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of great importance. Such mobilisation depends on technical potentials, actual costs, cost reduction potentials and technological maturity.

costs
The slightly higher electricity generation costs (compared to conventional fuels) under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are compensated for, to a large extent, by reduced demand for electricity. Assuming average costs of 3 cents/kWh for implementing energy efficiency measures, the additional cost for electricity supply under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will amount to a maximum of $10 billion/a in 2010. These additional costs, which represent society's investment in an environmentally benign, safe and economic energy supply, continue to decrease after 2010. By 2050 the annual costs of electricity supply will be $2,900 billion/a below those in the Reference Scenario.
It is assumed that average crude oil prices will increase from $52.5 per barrel in 2005 to $100 per barrel in 2010, and continue to rise to $140 per barrel in 2050. Natural gas import prices are expected to increase by a factor of four between 2005 and 2050, while coal prices will nearly double, reaching $360 per tonne in 2050. A CO2 `price adder' is applied, which rises from $10 per tonne of CO2 in 2010 to $50 per tonne of in 2050.
development of CO2 emissions
While CO2 emissions worldwide will double under the Reference Scenario up to 2050, and are thus far removed from a sustainable development path, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2003 to 10,590 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.8 tonnes/capita to 1.2 t/capita. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and a growing electricity demand, CO2 emissions will decrease enormously in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electric vehicles, as well as a sharp expansion in public transport, will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 35% of total emissions in 2050, the power sector will reduce significantly but remain the largest source of CO2 emissions - followed by transport and industry.

to make the energy [r]evolution real and to avoid dangerous climate change, Greenpeace and EREC demand for the energy sector that the following policies and actions are implemented:
1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
2. Internalise the external (social and environmental) costs of energy production through ""cap and trade"" emissions trading.
3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming appliances, buildings and vehicles.
4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation.
5. Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators.
6. Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example by feed-in tariff programmes.
7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information.
8. Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

long term energy [r]evolution scenarios
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario outlines a sustainable pathway for a new way of using and producing energy up to 2050. Greenpeace, the DLR and the renewable energy industry have now developed this scenario further towards a complete phasing out of fossil fuels in the second half of this century.
A long term scenario over almost 100 years cannot be exact. Projections of economic growth rates, fossil fuel prices or the overall energy demand are of course speculative and by no means represent forecasts. A regional breakdown is also not possible as sufficient technical data, such as exact wind speed data in specific locations, is not available. The grid integration of huge percentages of fluctuating sources such as wind and solar photovoltaics equally needs further scientific and technical research. But such a long term scenario can give us an idea of by when a complete fossil fuel and CO2 free energy supply at a global level is possible, and what long term production capacities for renewable energy sources are needed. In this context we developed two different long term scenarios: the long term Energy [R]evolution and the advanced Energy [R]evolution. The long term scenario follows the same projections until the end of this century.
By 2050, renewable energy sources will account for more than 50% of the world's primary energy demand in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. Approximately 44% of primary energy supply in 2050 still comes from fossil fuels, mainly oil used in the transport sector, followed by gas and coal in the power sector.
The long term Energy [R]evolution Scenario continues the development pathway up to 2100 with the following outcomes:
· demand: Energy efficiency potentials are largely exploited and primary energy demand therefore stabilises at 2060 levels.
· power sector: The electricity sector will pioneer the fossil fuel phase-out. By 2070 over 93% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources, with the remaining gas-fired power plants mainly used for backup power. A capacity of 23,100 GW will produce 56,800 TWh of renewable electricity in 2100 ­ 17 times more than today.
From the currently available technologies, solar photovoltaics, followed by wind power, concentrated solar power and geothermal, have the highest potentials in the power sector. The use of ocean energy might be significantly higher, but with the current state of development, the technical and economical potential remains unclear.

· heating and cooling: The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP) in 2050 will remain at the same level up to 2070. It will then fall back slightly to its 2040 level (5,500 TWh) until the end of this century, as the decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources, such as solar collectors and geothermal, limits the further expansion of CHP.
· In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will increase to 90% by 2080. A complete fossil fuels phase-out will be realised shortly afterwards.
· transport: Efficient use of transport systems will still be the main way of limiting fuel use. Public transport systems will continue to be far more energy efficient than individual vehicles. However, we assume that cars will still be needed, especially in rural areas. Between 2050 and 2085 the use of oil in cars will be phased out completely and replaced mainly by electric vehicles. The electricity will come from renewable energy sources.
· By 2080, about 90% of primary energy demand will be covered by renewable energy sources; in 2090 the renewable share will reach 98.2%.
The advanced Energy [R]evolution Scenario takes a much more radical approach to the climate crisis facing the world. In order to pull the emergency brake on global emissions it therefore assumes much shorter technical lifetimes for coal-fired power plants - 20 years instead of 40 years. This reduces global CO2 emissions even faster and takes the latest evidence of greater climate sensitivity into account. In order to fill the resulting gap, the annual growth rates of renewable energy sources, especially solar photovoltaics, wind and concentrated solar power plants, have been increased.
Growth rates increase from 2020 onwards to 2050. These expanded growth rates are in line with the current projections of the wind and solar industry (see Global Wind Energy Outlook 2008, Solar Generation 2008). So in the advanced scenario the capacities for solar and wind power generation appear 10 to 15 years earlier than projected in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The expansion of geothermal co-generation has also been moved 20 years ahead of its expected take-off. All other results remain the same as in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, with the only changes affecting the power sector.
The main change for the power sector in the advanced Energy [R]evolution Scenario is that all conventional coal-fired power plants are phased out by 2050. Between 2020 and 2050 a total of about 1,200 GW of capacity will be replaced by solar photovolatics, on- and offshore wind and concentrated solar power plants. By 2050, 86% of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources and 96% by 2070. Again the remaining fossil fuel-based power production is from gas. Compared to the basic Energy [R]evolution Scenario the expected capacity of renewable energy will emerge 15 years ahead of schedule, while the overall level of renewable power generation from 2085 onwards will be the same.

From the renewables industry perspective, these larger quantities are able to be delivered. However, the advanced scenario requires more research and development into the large scale grid integration of renewable energies as well as better regional meteorological data to optimise the mix of different sources.
It is important to highlight that in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario the majority of remaining coal power plants ­ which will be replaced 20 years before the end of their technical lifetime ­ are in China and India. This means that in practice all coal power plants built between 2005 and 2020 will be replaced by renewable energy sources. To support the building of capacity in developing countries significant new public financing, especially from industrialised countries, will be needed. It is vital that specific funding mechanisms are developed under the international climate negotiations that can assist the transfer of financial support to climate change mitigation, including technology transfer. Greenpeace International has developed one option for how such a funding mechanism could work (see Chapter 2).
almost zero CO2 emissions by 2080
While worldwide CO2 emissions will decrease under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario from 10,589 million tonnes in 2050 (51% below 1990 levels) down to 425 m/t in 2090, the advanced scenario would reduce emissions even faster. By 2050, the advanced Energy [R]evolution version would reduce CO2 emissions by 61% below 1990 levels, and 80% below by the year 2075. Annual per capita emissions would drop below 1 t/capita in 2050 under the advanced scenario, compared with around 2060 under the basic Energy [R]evolution.
Further CO2 reductions between 2040 and 2080 are only possible in the transport sector, as the major remaining emitters are combustion engines in cars. It is not possible to replace the remaining fossil fuelled cars with electric vehicles as this would drive electricity demand up again. The increased demand cannot be met by renewables in this timeframe since this would exceed growth rates and grid capacities based on today's knowledge. The only way to cut vehicle emissions further would be to reduce kilometres driven by about 40% between 2040 and 2080.

climate protection | EFFECTS

The greenhouse effect is the process by which the atmosphere traps some of the sun's energy, warming the Earth and moderating our climate. A human-driven increase in `greenhouse gases' has enhanced this effect artificially, raising global temperatures and disrupting our climate. These greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels and through deforestation, methane, released from agriculture, animals and landfill sites, and nitrous oxide, resulting from agricultural production plus a variety of industrial chemicals.
Every day we damage our climate by using fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas) for energy and transport. As a result, climate change is already impacting on our lives, and is expected to destroy the livelihoods of many people in the developing world, as well as ecosystems and species, in the coming decades. We therefore need to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This makes both environmental and economic sense.
According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations forum for established scientific opinion, the world's temperature is expected to increase over the next hundred years by up to 5.8°C. This is much faster than anything experienced so far in human history. The goal of climate policy should be to keep the global mean temperature rise to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. At 2°C and above, damage to ecosystems and disruption to the climate system increases dramatically. We have very little time within which we can change our energy system to meet these targets. This means that global emissions will have to peak and start to decline by the end of the next decade at the latest.
Climate change is already harming people and ecosystems. Its reality can be seen in disintegrating polar ice, thawing permafrost, dying coral reefs, rising sea levels and fatal heat waves. It is not only scientists that are witnessing these changes. From the Inuit in the far north to islanders near the Equator, people are already struggling with the impacts of climate change. An average global warming of 2°C threatens millions of people with an increased risk of hunger, malaria, flooding and water shortages. Never before has humanity been forced to grapple with such an immense environmental crisis. If we do not take urgent and immediate action to stop global warming, the damage could become irreversible. This can only happen through a rapid reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

This is a summary of some likely effects if we allow current trends to continue:
Likely effects of small to moderate warming
· Sea level rise due to melting glaciers and the thermal expansion of the oceans as global temperature increases. Massive releases of greenhouse gases from melting permafrost and dying forests.
· A greater risk of more extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts and floods. Already, the global incidence of drought has doubled over the past 30 years.
· Severe regional impacts. In Europe, river flooding will increase, as well as coastal flooding, erosion and wetland loss. Flooding will also severely affect low-lying areas in developing countries such as Bangladesh and South China.
· Natural systems, including glaciers, coral reefs, mangroves, alpine ecosystems, boreal forests, tropical forests, prairie wetlands and native grasslands will be severely threatened.
· Increased risk of species extinction and biodiversity loss.
The greatest impacts will be on poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Andean South America as well as small islands least able to protect themselves from increasing droughts, rising sea levels, the spread of disease and decline in agricultural production.
longer term catastrophic effects Warming from emissions may trigger the irreversible meltdown of the Greenland ice sheet, adding up to seven metres of sea level rise over several centuries. New evidence shows that the rate of ice discharge from parts of the Antarctic mean it is also at risk of meltdown. Slowing, shifting or shutting down of the Atlantic Gulf Stream current will have dramatic effects in Europe, and disrupt the global ocean circulation system. Large releases of methane from melting permafrost and from the oceans will lead to rapid increases of the gas in the atmosphere, and consequent warming.

the kyoto protocol
Recognising these threats, the signatories to the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. The Protocol finally entered into force in early 2005 and its 165 member countries meet twice annually to negotiate further refinement and development of the agreement. Only one major industrialised nation, the United States, has not ratified Kyoto.
The Kyoto Protocol commits its signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% from their 1990 level by the target period of 2008-2012. This has in turn resulted in the adoption of a series of regional and national reduction targets. In the European Union, for instance, the commitment is to an overall reduction of 8%. In order to help reach this target, the EU has also agreed a target to increase its proportion of renewable energy from 6% to 12% by 2010.
At present the Kyoto countries are negotiating the second phase of the agreement, covering the period from 2013-2017. Greenpeace is calling for industrialised country emissions to be reduced by 18% from 1990 levels for this second commitment period, and by 30% for the third period covering 2018-2022. Only with these cuts do we stand a reasonable chance of meeting the 2°C target.
The Kyoto Protocol's architecture relies fundamentally on legally binding emissions reduction obligations. To achieve these targets, carbon is turned into a commodity which can be traded. The aim is to encourage the most economically efficient emissions reductions, in turn leveraging the necessary investment in clean technology from the private sector to drive a revolution in energy supply.
Negotiators are running out of time, however. Signatory countries agreed a negotiating `mandate', known as the Bali Action Plan, in December 2007, but they must complete these negotiations with a final agreement on the second Kyoto commitment period by the end of 2009 at the absolute latest. Forward-thinking nations can move ahead of the game by implementing strong domestic targets now, building the industry and skills bases that will deliver the transition to a low-carbon society, and thereby provide a strong platform from which to negotiate the second commitment period.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK


climate protection | INTERNATIONAL POLICY - TARGETS - DEMANDS

international energy policy
At present, renewable energy generators have to compete with old nuclear and fossil fuel power stations which produce electricity at marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers have already paid the interest and depreciation on the original investments. Political action is needed to overcome these distortions and create a level playing field for renewable energy technologies to compete.
At a time when governments around the world are in the process of liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without political support, however, renewable energy remains at a disadvantage, marginalised by distortions in the world's electricity markets created by decades of massive financial, political and structural support to conventional technologies. Developing renewables will therefore require strong political and economic efforts, especially through laws that guarantee stable tariffs over a period of up to 20 years. Renewable energy will also contribute to sustainable economic growth, high quality jobs, technology development, global competitiveness and industrial and research leadership.
renewable energy targets
In recent years, in order to reduce greenhouse emissions as well as increase energy security, a growing number of countries have established targets for renewable energy. These are either expressed in terms of installed capacity or as a percentage of energy consumption. These targets have served as important catalysts for increasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world.
A time period of just a few years is not long enough in the electricity sector, however, where the investment horizon can be up to 40 years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short, medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order to be effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such as feed-in tariffs for renewable electricity generation. In order for the proportion of renewable energy to increase significantly, targets must be set in accordance with the local potential for each technology (wind, solar, biomass etc) and be complemented by policies that develop the skills and manufacturing bases to deliver the agreed quantity of renewable energy.
In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown that it is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in the renewables sector. In conjunction with the European Photovoltaic Industry Association1, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry Association2 and the Global Wind Energy Council3, the European Renewable Energy Council and Greenpeace have documented the development of those industries from 1990 onwards and outlined a prognosis for growth up to 2020 and 2040.

demands for the energy sector
Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear agenda for the policy changes which need to be made to encourage a shift to renewable sources. The main demands are:
1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
2. Internalise external (social and environmental) costs through ""cap and trade"" emissions trading.
3. Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming appliances, buildings and vehicles.
4. Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation.
5. Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators.
6. Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example through feed-in tariff payments.
7. Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information.
8. Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency
Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300 billion4 in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted markets. Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power, keep renewable energy out of the market place and prop up non-competitive technologies and fuels. Eliminating direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power would help move us towards a level playing field across the energy sector. Renewable energy would not need special provisions if markets factored in the cost of climate damage from greenhouse gas pollution. Subsidies to polluting technologies are perverse in that they are economically as well as environmentally detrimental. Removing subsidies from conventional electricity would not only save taxpayers' money. It would also dramatically reduce the need for renewable energy support.

This chapter outlines a Greenpeace proposal for a feed-in tariff system in developing countries financed by emissions trading from OECD countries.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows that renewable electricity generation has huge environmental and economic benefits. However its generation costs, especially in developing countries, will remain higher than those of existing coal or gas-fired power stations for the next five to ten years. To bridge this gap between conventional fossil fuel-based power generation and renewables, a support mechanism is needed.
The Feed in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading model (FFET) is a concept conceived by Greenpeace International5. The aim is the expansion of renewable energy in developing countries with financial support from industrialised nations ­ a mechanism to implement renewable energy technology transfer via future Joint Implementation, Clean Development Mechanism projects or Technology Transfer programmes under the Kyoto Protocol. With the Kyoto countries currently negotiating the second phase of their agreement, covering the period from 2013-2017, the proposed FFET mechanism could be used under all the existing flexible mechanisms, auctioning cap & trade schemes or linked to technology transfer projects.
The thinking behind the FFET in a nutshell is to link the feed-in tariff system, as it has been successfully applied in countries like Germany and Spain, with emissions trading schemes such as the ETS in Europe through already established international funding channels such as development aid banks or the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms.
bankable support schemes
Since the early development of renewable energies within the power sector, there has been an ongoing debate about the best and most effective type of support scheme. The European Commission published a survey in December 2005 which provides a good overview of the experience so far. According to this report, feed-in tariffs are by far the most efficient and successful mechanism. Globally more than 40 countries have adopted some version of the system.
Although the organisational form of these tariffs differs from country to country, there are certain clear criteria which emerge as essential for creating a successful renewable energy policy. At the heart of these is a reliable, bankable support scheme for renewable energy projects which provides long term stability and certainty6. Bankable support schemes result in lower cost projects because they lower the risk for both investors and equipment suppliers. The cost of wind-powered electricity in Germany is up to 40% cheaper than in the United Kingdom7, for example, because the support system is more secure and reliable.
For developing countries, feed-in laws would be an ideal mechanism for the implementation of new renewable energies. The extra costs, however, which are usually covered in Europe, for example, by a very minor increase in the overall electricity price for consumers, are still seen as an obstacle. In order to enable technology transfer from Annex 1 countries to developing countries, a mix of a feed-in law, international finance and emissions trading could be used to establish a locally based renewable energy infrastructure and industry with the assistance of OECD countries.
20

learning from experience
The FFET program brings together three different support mechanisms and builds on the experience from 20 years of renewable energy support programmes.
experience of feed-in tariffs
· Feed-in tariffs are seen as the best way forward and very popular, especially in developing countries.
· The main argument against them is the increase in electricity prices for households and industry, as the extra costs are shared across all customers. This is particularly difficult for developing countries, where many people can't afford to spend more money for electricity services.
experience of emissions trading Emissions trading (between countries which need to make emissions reductions and countries where renewable energy projects can be more easily or cheaply implemented) already plays a role in achieving CO2 reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. The experience so far is that:
· The CO2 market is unstable, with the price per tonne varying significantly.
· The market is still a `virtual' market, with only limited actual flow of money.
· Putting a price on CO2 emissions makes fossil fuelled power more expensive, but due to the unstable and fluctuating prices it will not help to make renewable energy projects more economic within the foreseeable future.
· Most systems are not yet delivering real cuts in emissions.
experience of international financing Finance for renewable energy projects is one of the main obstacles in developing countries. While large scale projects have fewer funding problems, small, community based projects, whilst having a high degree of public acceptance, face financing difficulties. The experiences from micro credits for small hydro projects in Bangladesh, for example, as well as wind farms in Denmark and Germany, show how strong local participation and acceptance can be achieved. The main reasons for this are the economic benefits flowing to the local community and careful project planning based on good local knowledge and understanding. When the community identifies the project rather than the project identifying the community, the result is generally faster bottom-up growth of the renewables sector.
combining existing programmes
The basic aims of the Feed-in Tariff Fund Emissions Trading scheme are to facilitate the implementation of feed-in laws for developing countries, to use existing emissions trading schemes to link CO2 prices directly with the uptake of renewable energy, and to use the existing infrastructure,of international financial institutions to secure investment for projects and lower the risk factor.The FFET concept will have three parts ­ fixed feed-in tariffs, emissions trading and a funding arrangement.

implementing the energy [r]evolution | FIXED FEED-IN TARIFFS - EMISSIONS TRADING - THE FFET FUND

1. fixed feed-in tariffs
Feed-in tariffs will provide bankable and long term stable support for the development of a local renewable energy market in developing countries. The tariffs should bridge the gap between conventional power generation costs and those of renewable energy generation.
The key parameters for feed-in tariffs under FFET are:
· Variable tariffs for different renewable energy technologies, depending on their costs and technology maturity, paid for 20 years.
· Payments based on actual generation in order to achieve properly maintained projects with high performance ratios.
· Any additional finance required over the (20 year) period will be secured through a public fund, which could generate some capital income, for example via interest rates, from a soft loan programme to finance renewable energy projects (see below).
· Payment of the `additional costs' for renewable generation will be based on the Spanish system of the wholesale electricity price plus a fixed premium.
A developing country which wants to apply for funding to operate renewable energy projects under the FFET scheme will need to establish clear regulations for the following:
· Guaranteed access to the electricity grid for renewable electricity projects.
· Establishment of a feed-in law based on successful examples.
· Transparent access to all data needed to establish the feed-in tariff, including full records of generated electricity.
· Clear planning and licencing procedures.
2. emissions trading
The traded CO2 emissions will come from OECD countries on top of any commitment under their national emission reduction targets. Every tonne of CO2 will be connected to a specific amount of electricity form renewable energy. A simple approach would be to use a factor of 1kg CO2 for 1 kWh of renewable electricity, which equals the amount of avoided CO2 emissions from an older coal power plant. A more complex method would be to use the average CO2 emissions per kilowatt-hour in the specific country or the world's average, which is currently 0.6kg CO2/kWh. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario shows that the average additional costs (under the proposed energy mix) between 2008 and 2015 are between 1 and 4 cents per kilowatt-hour so the price per tonne of CO2 would be between 10 and 40.
The key parameters for emissions trading under FFET will be:
· 1 tonne CO2 = 1,000 kWh renewable electricity (emissions factor: 1kg CO2/kWh)
· 1 tonne CO2 represents a 20 year `package' of renewable electricity (1,000 kWh = 20 years x annual 50 kWh renewable electricity production)

3. the FFET fund
The FFET fund will act as a buffer between fluctuating CO2 emissions prices and stable long term feed-in tariffs. The fund will secure the payment of the required feed-in tariffs during the whole period (about 20 years) for each project. This fund could be managed by intrernational financial institutions operating in Europe and Central Asia or by Multilateral Development Banks. In order to provide access to finance for small-scale businesses, a co-operation with a local bank with a local presence in villages or cities would be desirable.
All renewable energy projects must have a clear set of environmental criteria which are part of the national licensing procedure in the country where the project will generate electricity. Those criteria will have to meet a minimum environmental standard defined by an independent monitoring group. If there are already acceptable criteria developed, for example for CDM projects, they should be adopted rather than reinventing the wheel. The board members will come from NGOs, energy and finance experts as well as members of the governments involved. The fund will not be able to use the money for speculative investments. It can only provide soft loans for FFET projects.
The key parameters for the FFET fund will be:
· The fund will guarantee the payment of the total feed-in tariffs over a period of 20 years if the project is operated properly.
· The fund will receive annual income from emissions trading under FFET.
· The fund can provide soft loans to finance renewable energy projects.
· The fund will generate income from interest rates only.
· The fund will pay feed-in tariffs annually only on the basis of generated electricity.
· The operator of a FFET project is required to transmit all relevant data about generation to a central database. This database will also be used to evaluate the performance of the project.
· Every FFET project must have a professional maintenance company to ensure high availability.
· The grid operator must do its own monitoring and send generation data to the FFET fund. Data from the project and grid operators will be compared regularly to check consistency.

implementing the energy [r]evolution | FFET SCHEME

Nuclear energy is a relatively small industry with big problems. It covers just one sixteenth of the world's primary energy consumption, a share set to decline over the coming decades. The average age of operating commercial nuclear reactors is 23 years, so more power stations are being shut down than started. In 2007, world nuclear production fell by 1.8 % and the number of operating reactors was 439, five less than the historical peak of 2002.
In terms of new power stations, the amount of nuclear capacity added annually between 2000 and 2007 was 2,500 MWe on average. This was six times less than wind power (13,300 MWe per annum between 2000 and 2007). In 2007, newly constructed renewable energy power plants in Germany generated 13 TWh of electricity ­ as much as two large nuclear units.
Despite the rhetoric of a `nuclear renaissance', the industry is struggling with a massive increase in costs and construction delays as well as safety and security problems linked to reactor operation, radioactive waste and nuclear proliferation.
a solution to climate protection?
The promise of nuclear energy to contribute to both climate protection and energy supply needs to be checked against reality. In the most recent Energy Technology Perspectives report published by the International Energy Agency8, for example, its Blue Map scenario outlines a future energy mix which would halve global carbon emissions by the middle of this century. To reach this goal the IEA assumes a massive expansion of nuclear power between now and 2050, with installed capacity increasing four-fold and electricity generation reaching 9,857 TWh/year, compared to 2,608 TWh in 2007. In order to achieve this, the report says that 32 large reactors (1,000 MWe) would have to be built every year from now until 2050. This would be unrealistic, expensive, hazardous and too late to make a difference.
unrealistic: Such a rapid growth is practically impossible given the technical limitations. This scale of development was achieved in the history of nuclear power for only two years at the peak of the statedriven boom of the mid-1980s. It is unlikely to be achieved again, not to mention maintained for 40 consecutive years. While 1984 and 1985 saw 31 GW of newly added nuclear capacity, the decade average was 17 GW annually. In the past ten years, only three large reactors have been brought on line each year, and the current production capacity of the global nuclear industry cannot deliver more than an annual six units.

expensive: The IEA scenario assumes very optimistic investment costs of $2,100/kWe installed, in line with what the industry has been recently promising. The reality indicates three times that much. Recent estimates by US business analysts Moody's (June 2008) put the cost of nuclear investment as high as $7,000/kWe. Price quotes for projects under preparation in the US cover a range from $5,200 to 8,000/kWe9. The latest cost estimate for the first French EPR pressurised water reactor being built in Finland is $5,200/kWe, a figure likely to increase for later reactors as prices escalate. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the cost index for nuclear components has risen by 173 % since 2000 ­ a near tripling over the past eight years10. Building 1,400 large reactors (1,000 MWe), even at the current cost of about $7,000/kWe, would require an investment of US$9.8 trillion.
hazardous: Massive expansion of nuclear energy would necessarily lead to a large increase in related hazards, such as serious reactor accidents, growing stockpiles of deadly high level nuclear waste which will need to be safeguarded for thousands of years and potential proliferation of both nuclear technologies and materials that can be diverted to military or terrorist use. The 1,400 large operating reactors in 2050 would generate an annual 35,000 tons of spent fuel (assuming they are light water reactors, the most common design for most new projects). This also means the production of 350,000 kilograms of plutonium each year, enough to build 35,000 crude nuclear weapons.
Most of the expected electricity demand growth by 2050 will occur in non-OECD countries. This means that a large proportion of the new reactors would need to be built in those countries in order to have a global impact on emissions. At the moment, the list of countries with announced nuclear ambitions is long and worrying in terms of their political situation and stability, especially with the need to guarantee against the hazards of accidents and proliferation for many decades. The World Nuclear Association listed the Emerging Nuclear Energy Countries in May 2008 as Albania, Belarus, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Norway, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland, Iran, the Gulf states, Yemen, Israel, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Venezuela, Nigeria, Ghana and Namibia.
slow: Climate science says that we need to reach a peak of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2015 and reduce them by 20 % in 2020. Even in developed countries with an established nuclear infrastructure it takes at least a decade from the decision to build a reactor to the delivery of its first electricity, and often much longer. Out of 35 reactors officially listed as under construction by the IEA in mid-July 2008, one third had been in this category for two decades or more, indicating that these projects are not progressing. This means that even if the world's governments decided to implement strong nuclear expansion now, only a few reactors would start generating electricity before 2020. The contribution from nuclear power towards reducing emissions would come too late to help.


nuclear power blocks solutions
Even if the ambitious nuclear scenario is implemented, regardless of costs and hazards, the IEA concludes that the contribution of nuclear power to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector would be only 4.6 % - less than 3 % of the global overall reduction required.
There are other technologies that can deliver much larger emission reductions, and much faster. Their investment costs are lower and they do not create global security risks. Even the IEA finds that the combined potential of efficiency savings and renewable energy to cut emissions by 2050 is more than ten times larger than that of nuclear.
The world has limited time, finance and industrial capacity to change our energy sector and achieve a large reduction in greenhouse emissions. Choosing the pathway by spending $10 trillion on nuclear development would be a fatally wrong decision. It would not save the climate but it would necessarily take resources away from solutions described in this report and at the same time create serious global security hazards. Therefore new nuclear reactors are a clearly dangerous obstacle to the protection of the climate.
nuclear power in the energy [r]evolution scenario
For the reasons explained above, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario envisages a nuclear phase-out. Existing reactors would be closed at the end of their average operational lifetime of 35 years. We assume that no new construction is started after 2008 and only two thirds of the reactors currently under construction will be finally put into operation.
the dangers of nuclear power
Although the generation of electricity through nuclear power produces much less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels, there are multiple threats to people and the environment from its operations. The main risks are:
· Nuclear Proliferation
· Nuclear Waste
· Safety Risks
These are the background to why nuclear power has been discounted as a future technology in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.


1. nuclear proliferation
Manufacturing a nuclear bomb requires fissile material - either uranium-235 or plutonium-239. Most nuclear reactors use uranium as a fuel and produce plutonium during their operation. It is impossible to adequately protect a large reprocessing plant to prevent the diversion of plutonium to nuclear weapons. A smallscale plutonium separation plant can be built in four to six months, so any country with an ordinary reactor can produce nuclear weapons relatively quickly.
The result is that nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown up like Siamese twins. Since international controls on nuclear proliferation began, Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea have all obtained nuclear weapons, demonstrating the link between civil and military nuclear power. Both the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) embody an inherent contradiction - seeking to promote the development of `peaceful' nuclear power whilst at the same time trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons
Israel, India and Pakistan all used their civil nuclear operations to develop weapons capability, operating outside international safeguards. North Korea developed a nuclear weapon even as a signatory of the NPT. A major challenge to nuclear proliferation controls has been the spread of uranium enrichment technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, has said that ""should a state with a fully developed fuel-cycle capability decide, for whatever reason, to break away from its nonproliferation commitments, most experts believe it could produce a nuclear weapon within a matter of months11.""
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has also warned that the security threat of trying to tackle climate change with a global fast reactor programme (using plutonium fuel) ""would be colossal""12. Even without fast reactors, all of the reactor designs currently being promoted around the world could be fuelled by MOX (mixed oxide fuel), from which plutonium can be easily separated.
Restricting the production of fissile material to a few `trusted' countries will not work. It will engender resentment and create a colossal security threat. A new UN agency is needed to tackle the twin threats of climate change and nuclear proliferation by phasing out nuclear power and promoting sustainable energy, in the process promoting world peace rather than threatening it.



nuclear power | NUCLEAR WASTE - SAFETY RISKS

3
2. nuclear waste
The nuclear industry claims it can `dispose' of its nuclear waste by burying it deep underground, but this will not isolate the radioactive material from the environment forever. A deep dump only slows down the release of radioactivity into the environment. The industry tries to predict how fast a dump will leak so that it can claim that radiation doses to the public living nearby in the future will be ""acceptably low"". But scientific understanding is not sufficiently advanced to make such predictions with any certainty.
As part of its campaign to build new nuclear stations around the world, the industry claims that problems associated with burying nuclear waste are to do with public acceptability rather than technical issues. It points to nuclear dumping proposals in Finland, Sweden or the United States to underline its argument.
The most hazardous waste is the highly radioactive waste (or spent) fuel removed from nuclear reactors, which stays radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. In some countries the situation is exacerbated by `reprocessing' this spent fuel ­ which involves dissolving it in nitric acid to separate out weapons-usable plutonium. This process leaves behind a highly radioactive liquid waste. There are about 270,000 tonnes of spent nuclear waste fuel in storage, much of it at reactor sites. Spent fuel is accumulating at around 12,000 tonnes per year, with around a quarter of that going for reprocessing13. No country in the world has a solution for high level waste.
The IAEA recognises that, despite its international safety requirements, ""...radiation doses to individuals in the future can only be estimated and that the uncertainties associated with these estimates will increase for times farther into the future.""
The least damaging option for waste already created at the current time is to store it above ground, in dry storage at the site of origin, although this option also presents major challenges and threats. The only real solution is to stop producing the waste.

3. safety risks
Windscale (1957), Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986) and Tokaimura (1999) are only a few of the hundreds of nuclear accidents which have occurred to date.
A simple power failure at a Swedish nuclear plant in 2006 highlighted our vulnerability to nuclear catastrophe. Emergency power systems at the Forsmark plant failed for 20 minutes during a power cut and four of Sweden's 10 nuclear power stations had to be shut down. If power was not restored there could have been a major incident within hours. A former director of the Forsmark plant later said that ""it was pure luck there wasn't a meltdown"". The closure of the plants removed at a stroke roughly 20% of Sweden's electricity supply.
A nuclear chain reaction must be kept under control, and harmful radiation must, as far as possible, be contained within the reactor, with radioactive products isolated from humans and carefully managed. Nuclear reactions generate high temperatures, and fluids used for cooling are often kept under pressure. Together with the intense radioactivity, these high temperatures and pressures make operating a reactor a difficult and complex task.
The risks from operating reactors are increasing and the likelihood of an accident is now higher than ever. Most of the world's reactors are more than 20 years old and therefore more prone to age related failures. Many utilities are attempting to extend their life from the 40 years or so they were originally designed for to around 60 years, posing new risks.
De-regulation has meanwhile pushed nuclear utilities to decrease safety-related investments and limit staff whilst increasing reactor pressure and operational temperature and the burn-up of the fuel. This accelerates ageing and decreases safety margins.
New so-called passively safe reactors have many safety systems replaced by `natural' processes, such as gravity fed emergency cooling water and air cooling. This can make them more vulnerable to terrorist attack.

""... reactors with gravity fed emergency cooling water and air cooling can make them more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.""

1. uranium mining
Uranium, used in nuclear power plants, is extracted from huge mines in Canada, Australia, Russia and Nigeria. Mine workers can breathe in radioactive gas from which they are in danger of contracting lung cancer. Uranium mining produces huge quantities of mining debris, including radioactive particles which can contaminate surface water and food.

4. power plant operation
Uranium nuclei are split in a nuclear reactor, releasing energy which heats up water. The compressed steam is converted in a turbine generator into electricity. This process creates a radioactive `cocktail' which involves more than 100 products. One of these is the highly toxic and long-lasting plutonium. Radioactive material can enter the environment through accidents at nuclear power plants. The worst accident to date happened at Chernobyl in the then Soviet Union in 1986. A nuclear reactor generates enough plutonium every year for the production of as many as 39 nuclear weapons.

5. reprocessing
Reprocessing involves the chemical extraction of contaminated uranium and plutonium from used reactor fuel rods. There are now over 230,000 kilograms of plutonium stockpiled around the world from reprocessing ­ five kilograms is sufficient for one nuclear bomb. Reprocessing is not the same as recycling: the volume of waste increases many tens of times and millions of litres of radioactive waste are discharged into the sea and air each day. The process also demands the transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste by ship, rail, air and road around the world. An accident or terrorist attack could release vast quantities of nuclear material into the environment. There is no way to guarantee the safety of nuclear transport.

2. uranium enrichment
Natural uranium and concentrated `yellow cake' contain just 0.7% of fissionable uranium 235. To use the material in a nuclear reactor, the share must go up to 3 or 5 %. This process can be carried out in 16 facilities around the world. 80% of the total volume is rejected as `tails', a waste product. Enrichment generates massive amounts of `depleted uranium' that ends up as long-lived radioactive waste or is used in weapons or as tank shielding.

3. fuel rod ­ production
Enriched material is converted into uranium dioxide and compressed to pellets in fuel rod production facilities. These pellets fill 4m long tubes called fuel rods. There are 29 fuel rod production facilities globally. The worst accident in this type of facility happened in September 1999 in Tokaimura, Japan, when two workers died. Several hundred workers and villagers have suffered radioactive contamination.

6. waste storage
There is not a single final storage facility for nuclear waste available anywhere in the world. Safe secure storage of high level waste over thousands of years remains unproven, leaving a deadly legacy for future generations. Despite this the nuclear industry continues to generate more and more waste each day.

THE DUO UNDERTAKE THE EXPEDITION TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE PLIGHT OF THE POLAR BEAR WHICH SCIENTISTS CLAIM COULD BE EXTINCT AS EARLY AS 2050 DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING.


The climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy revolution. The expert consensus is that this fundamental change must begin very soon and be well underway within the next ten years in order to avert the worst impacts. What we need is a complete transformation in the way we produce, consume and distribute energy and at the same time maintain economic growth. Nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit global warming to less than a rise in temperature of 2°C, above which the impacts become devastating.
Current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with their associated CO2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary input energy. More energy is lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. The system is innately vulnerable to disruption: localised technical, weather-related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. Whichever technology is used to generate electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these problems. At the core of the Energy [R]evolution there therefore needs to be a change in the way that energy is both produced and distributed.
key principles
the energy [r]evolution can be achieved by adhering to five key principles:
1.respect natural limits ­ phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century We must learn to respect natural limits. There is only so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. Each year we emit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent; we are literally filling up the sky. Geological resources of coal could provide several hundred years of fuel, but we cannot burn them and keep within safe limits. Oil and coal development must be ended.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to reduce energy related CO2 emissions to a maximum of 10 Gt (Giga tonnes) by 2050 and phase out fossil fuels by 2085.
2.equity and fairness As long as there are natural limits there needs to be a fair distribution of benefits and costs within societies, between nations and between present and future generations. At one extreme, a third of the world's population has no access to electricity, whilst the most industrialised countries consume much more than their fair share.
The effects of climate change on the poorest communities are exacerbated by massive global energy inequality. If we are to address climate change, one of the principles must be equity and fairness, so that the benefits of energy services ­ such as light, heat, power and transport ­ are available for all: north and south, rich and poor. Only in this way can we create true energy security, as well as the conditions for genuine human wellbeing.
The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has a target to achieve energy equity as soon as technically possible. By 2050 the average per capita emission should be between 1 and 2 tonnes of CO2.

3. implement clean, renewable solutions and decentralise

energy systems There is no energy shortage. All we need to do is

use existing technologies to harness energy effectively and

4

efficiently. Renewable energy and energy efficiency measures are

ready, viable and increasingly competitive. Wind, solar and other

renewable energy technologies have experienced double digit

market growth for the past decade.

Just as climate change is real, so is the renewable energy sector. Sustainable decentralised energy systems produce less carbon emissions, are cheaper and involve less dependence on imported fuel. They create more jobs and empower local communities. Decentralised systems are more secure and more efficient. This is what the Energy [R]evolution must aim to create.

""THE STONE AGE DID NOT END FOR LACK OF STONE, AND THE OIL AGE WILL END LONG BEFORE THE WORLD RUNS OUT OF OIL.""
Sheikh Zaki Yamani, former Saudi Arabian oil minister
To stop the Earth's climate spinning out of control, most of the world's fossil fuel reserves ­ coal, oil and gas ­ must remain in the ground. Our goal is for humans to live within the natural limits of our small planet.
4.decouple growth from fossil fuel use Starting in the developed countries, economic growth must fully decouple from fossil fuels. It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must be predicated on their increased combustion.
We need to use the energy we produce much more efficiently, and we need to make the transition to renewable energy ­ away from fossil fuels ­ quickly in order to enable clean and sustainable growth.
5.phase out dirty, unsustainable energy We need to phase out coal and nuclear power. We cannot continue to build coal plants at a time when emissions pose a real and present danger to both ecosystems and people. And we cannot continue to fuel the myriad nuclear threats by pretending nuclear power can in any way help to combat climate change. There is no role for nuclear power in the Energy [R]evolution.
from principles to practice
In 2005, renewable energy sources accounted for 13% of the world's primary energy demand. Biomass, which is mostly used for heating, is the main renewable energy source. The share of renewable energy in electricity generation was 18%. The contribution of renewables to primary energy demand for heat supply was around 24%. About 80% of primary energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels, and 6% from nuclear power14.
The time is right to make substantial structural changes in the energy and power sector within the next decade. Many power plants in industrialised countries, such as the USA, Japan and the European Union, are nearing retirement; more than half of all operating power plants are over 20 years old. At the same time developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, are looking to satisfy the growing energy demand created by expanding economies.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

the energy [r]evolution | DEVELOPMENT PATHWAY

Within the next ten years, the power sector will decide how this new demand will be met, either by fossil and nuclear fuels or by the
4 efficient use of renewable energy. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario
is based on a new political framework in favour of renewable energy and cogeneration combined with energy efficiency.
To make this happen both renewable energy and cogeneration ­ on a large scale and through decentralised, smaller units ­ have to grow faster than overall global energy demand. Both approaches must replace old generating technologies and deliver the additional energy required in the developing world.
As it is not possible to switch directly from the current large scale fossil and nuclear fuel based energy system to a full renewable energy supply, a transition phase is required to build up the necessary infrastructure. Whilst remaining firmly committed to the promotion of renewable sources of energy, we appreciate that gas, used in appropriately scaled cogeneration plant, is valuable as a transition fuel, and able to drive cost-effective decentralisation of the energy infrastructure. With warmer summers, tri-generation, which incorporates heat-fired absorption chillers to deliver cooling capacity in addition to heat and power, will become a particularly valuable means to achieve emissions reductions.
a development pathway
The Energy [R]evolution envisages a development pathway which turns the present energy supply structure into a sustainable system. There are two main stages to this.
step 1: energy efficiency The Energy [R]evolution is aimed at the ambitious exploitation of the potential for energy efficiency. It focuses on current best practice and technologies which will become available in the future, assuming continuous innovation. The energy savings are fairly equally distributed over the three sectors ­ industry, transport and domestic/business. Intelligent use, not abstinence, is the basic philosophy for future energy conservation.
The most important energy saving options are improved heat insulation and building design, super efficient electrical machines and drives, replacement of old style electrical heating systems by renewable heat production (such as solar collectors) and a reduction in energy consumption by vehicles used for goods and passenger traffic. Industrialised countries, which currently use energy in the most inefficient way, can reduce their consumption drastically without the loss of either housing comfort or information and entertainment electronics. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario uses energy saved in OECD countries as a compensation for the increasing power requirements in developing countries. The ultimate goal is stabilisation of global energy consumption within the next two decades. At the same time the aim is to create ""energy equity"" ­ shifting the current one-sided waste of energy in the industrialised countries towards a fairer worldwide distribution of efficiently used supply.
A dramatic reduction in primary energy demand compared to the IEA's ""Reference Scenario"" (see Chapter 6) ­ but with the same GDP and population development - is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources in the overall energy supply system, compensating for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.

step 2: structural changes
decentralised energy and large scale renewables In order to achieve higher fuel efficiencies and reduce distribution losses, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario makes extensive use of Decentralised Energy (DE).This is energy generated at or near the point of use.
DE is connected to a local distribution network system, supplying homes and offices, rather than the high voltage transmission system. The proximity of electricity generating plant to consumers allows any waste heat from combustion processes to be piped to buildings nearby, a system known as cogeneration or combined heat and power. This means that nearly all the input energy is put to use, not just a fraction as with traditional centralised fossil fuel plant.
DE also includes stand-alone systems entirely separate from the public networks, for example heat pumps, solar thermal panels or biomass heating. These can all be commercialised at a domestic level to provide sustainable low emission heating. Although DE technologies can be considered `disruptive' because they do not fit the existing electricity market and system, with appropriate changes they have the potential for exponential growth, promising `creative destruction' of the existing energy sector.
A huge proportion of global energy in 2050 will be produced by decentralised energy sources, although large scale renewable energy supply will still be needed in order to achieve a fast transition to a renewables dominated system. Large offshore wind farms and concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the sunbelt regions of the world will therefore have an important role to play.
cogeneration The increased use of combined heat and power generation (CHP) will improve the supply system's energy conversion efficiency, whether using natural gas or biomass. In the longer term, decreasing demand for heat and the large potential for producing heat directly from renewable energy sources will limit the further expansion of CHP.
renewable electricity The electricity sector will be the pioneer of renewable energy utilisation. All renewable electricity technologies have been experiencing steady growth over the past 20 to 30 years of up to 35% annually and are expected to consolidate at a high level between 2030 and 2050. By 2050, the majority of electricity will be produced from renewable energy sources. Expected growth of electricity use in transport will further promote the effective use of renewable power generation technologies.
renewable heating In the heat supply sector, the contribution of renewables will increase significantly. Growth rates are expected to be similar to those of the renewable electricity sector. Fossil fuels will be increasingly replaced by more efficient modern technologies, in particular biomass, solar collectors and geothermal. By 2050, renewable energy technologies will satisfy the major part of heating and cooling demand.

optimised integration of renewable energy
Modification of the energy system will be necessary to accommodate the significantly higher shares of renewable energy expected under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. This is not unlike what happened in the 1970s and 1980s, when most of the centralised power plants now operating were constructed in OECD countries. New high voltage power lines were built, night storage heaters marketed and large electric-powered hot water boilers installed in order to sell the electricity produced by nuclear and coal-fired plants at night.
Several OECD countries have demonstrated that it is possible to smoothly integrate a large proportion of decentralised energy, including variable sources such as wind. A good example is Denmark, which has the highest percentage of combined heat and power generation and wind power in Europe. With strong political support, 50% of electricity and 80% of district heat is now supplied by cogeneration plants. The contribution of wind power has reached more than 18% of Danish electricity demand. At certain times, electricity generation from cogeneration and wind turbines even exceeds demand. The load compensation required for grid stability in Denmark is managed both through regulating the capacity of the few large power stations and through import and export to neighbouring countries. A three tier tariff system enables balancing of power generation from the decentralised power plants with electricity consumption on a daily basis.
It is important to optimise the energy system as a whole through intelligent management by both producers and consumers, by an appropriate mix of power stations and through new systems for storing electricity.

appropriate power station mix: The power supply in OECD countries is mostly generated by coal and ­ in some cases ­ nuclear power stations, which are difficult to regulate. Modern gas power stations, by contrast, are not only highly efficient but easier and faster to regulate and thus better able to compensate for fluctuating loads. Coal and nuclear power stations have lower fuel and operating costs but comparably high investment costs. They must therefore run round-the-clock as `base load' in order to earn back their investment. Gas power stations have lower investment costs and are profitable even at low output, making them better suited to balancing out the variations in supply from renewable energy sources.
load management: The level and timing of demand for electricity can be managed by providing consumers with financial incentives to reduce or shut off their supply at periods of peak consumption. Control technology can be used to manage the arrangement. This system is already used for some large industrial customers. A Norwegian power supplier even involves private household customers by sending them a text message with a signal to shut down. Each household can decide in advance whether or not they want to participate. In Germany, experiments are being conducted with time flexible tariffs so that washing machines operate at night and refrigerators turn off temporarily during periods of high demand.
This type of load management has been simplified by advances in communications technology. In Italy, for example, 30 million innovative electricity counters have been installed to allow remote meter reading and control of consumer and service information. Many household electrical products or systems, such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, storage heaters, water pumps and air conditioning, can be managed either by temporary shut-off or by rescheduling their time of operation, thus freeing up electricity load for other uses.

generation management: Renewable electricity generation systems can also be involved in load optimisation. Wind farms, for example, can be temporarily switched off when too much power is available on the network.
energy storage: Another method of balancing out electricity supply and demand is through intermediate storage. This storage can be decentralised, for example by the use of batteries, or centralised. So far, pumped storage hydropower stations have been the main method of storing large amounts of electric power. In a pumped storage system, energy from power generation is stored in a lake and then allowed to flow back when required, driving turbines and generating electricity. 280 such pumped storage plants exist worldwide. They already provide an important contribution to security of supply, but their operation could be better adjusted to the requirements of a future renewable energy system.
In the long term, other storage solutions are beginning to emerge. One promising solution besides the use of hydrogen is the use of compressed air. In these systems, electricity is used to compress air into deep salt domes 600 metres underground and at pressures of up to 70 bar. At peak times, when electricity demand is high, the air is allowed to flow back out of the cavern and drive a turbine. Although this system, known as CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage) currently still requires fossil fuel auxiliary power, a socalled ""adiabatic"" plant is being developed which does not. To achieve this, the heat from the compressed air is intermediately stored in a giant heat store. Such a power station can achieve a storage efficiency of 70%.
The forecasting of renewable electricity generation is also continually improving. Regulating supply is particularly expensive when it has to be found at short notice. However, prediction techniques for wind power generation have become considerably more accurate in recent years and are still being improved. The demand for balancing supply will therefore decrease in the future.

the ""virtual power station"" 16

The rapid development of information technologies is helping to pave the way for a decentralised energy supply based on

the energy [r]evolution | THE ""VIRTUAL POWER STATION""

cogeneration plants, renewable energy systems and conventional

power stations. Manufacturers of small cogeneration plants already

offer internet interfaces which enable remote control of the system.

It is now possible for individual householders to control their

electricity and heat usage so that expensive electricity drawn from

the grid can be minimised ­ and the electricity demand profile is

smoothed. This is part of the trend towards the `smart house' where

its mini cogeneration plant becomes an energy management centre.

We can go one step further than this with a `virtual power station'.

Virtual does not mean that the power station does not produce real

electricity. It refers to the fact that there is no large, spatially

located power station with turbines and generators. The hub of the

virtual power station is a control unit which processes data from

many decentralised power stations, compares them with predictions

of power demand, generation and weather conditions, retrieves the

available power market prices and then intelligently optimises the

overall power station activity. Some public utilities already use such

systems, integrating cogeneration plants, wind farms, photovoltaic

systems and other power plants. The virtual power station can also

link consumers into the management process.

future power grids

4

The power grid network must also change in order to realise decentralised structures with a high share of renewable energy.

the energy [r]evolution | FUTURE POWER GRIDS

Today's grids are designed to transport power from a few

centralised power stations out to the passive consumers. A future

system must enable an active integration of consumers and

decentralised power generators and thus realise real time two-way

power and information flows. Large power stations will feed

electricity into the high voltage grid but small decentralised systems

such as solar, cogeneration and wind plants will deliver their power

into the low or medium voltage grid. In order to transport

electricity from renewable generation such as offshore wind farms

in remote areas (see box), a limited number of new high voltage

transmission lines will need to be constructed. These power lines will

also be available for cross-border power trade. Within the Energy

[R]evolution Scenario, the share of variable renewable energy

sources is expected to reach about 10% of total electricity

generation by 2020 and about 35% by 2050.

case 1: a north sea electricity grid
A new Greenpeace report shows how a regionally integrated approach to the large-scale development of offshore wind in the North Sea could deliver reliable clean energy for millions of homes. The `North Sea Electricity Grid [R]evolution' report (September 2008) calls for the creation of an offshore network to enable the smooth flow of electricity generated from renewable energy sources into the power systems of seven different countries - the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark and Norway ­ at the same time enabling significant emissions savings. The cost of developing the grid is expected to be between 15 and 20 billion. This investment would not only allow the broad integration of renewable energy but also unlock unprecedented power trading opportunities and cost efficiency. In a recent example, a new 600 kilometre-long power line between Norway and the Netherlands cost 600 million to build, but is already generating a daily cross-border trade valued at 800,000.
The grid would enable the efficient integration of renewable energy into the power system across the whole North Sea region. By aggregating power generation from wind farms spread across the whole area, periods of very low or very high power flows would be reduced to a negligible amount. A dip in wind power generation in one area would be `balanced' by higher production in another area, even hundreds of kilometres away. Over a year, an installed offshore wind power capacity of 68.4 GW in the North Sea would be able to generate an estimated 247 TWh of electricity.
An offshore grid in the North Sea would also allow, for example, the import of electricity from hydro power generation in Norway to the British and UCTE (Central European) network. This could replace thermal baseload plants and increase flexibility within a portfolio. In addition, increased liquidity and trading facilities on the European power markets will allow for a more efficient portfolio management. The value of such an offshore therefore lies in its contribution to increased security of supply, its function in aggregating the dispatch of power from offshore wind farms and its role as a facilitator for power exchange and trade between regions and power systems.

""a future system must enable an active integration of consumers and decentralised power generators...""

Energy is central to reducing poverty, providing major benefits in the areas of health, literacy and equity. More than a quarter of the

world's population has no access to modern energy services. In sub-

Saharan Africa, 80% of people have no electricity supply. For

cooking and heating, they depend almost exclusively on burning

biomass ­ wood, charcoal and dung.

Poor people spend up to a third of their income on energy, mostly to cook food. Women in particular devote a considerable amount of time to collecting, processing and using traditional fuel for cooking. In India, two to seven hours each day can be devoted to the collection of cooking fuel. This is time that could be spent on child care, education or income generation. The World Health Organisation estimates that 2.5 million women and young children in developing countries die prematurely each year from breathing the fumes from indoor biomass stoves.

The Millennium Development Goal of halving global poverty by 2015 will not be reached without adequate energy to increase production, income and education, create jobs and reduce the daily grind involved in having to just survive. Halving hunger will not come about without energy for more productive growing, harvesting, processing and marketing of food.

Improving health and reducing death rates will not happen without energy for the refrigeration needed for clinics, hospitals and vaccination campaigns.The world's greatest child killer, acute respiratory infection, will not be tackled without dealing with smoke from cooking fires in the home. Children will not study at night without light in their homes. Clean water will not be pumped or treated without energy.
The UN Commission on Sustainable Development argues that ""to implement the goal accepted by the international community of halving the proportion of people living on less than US $1 per day by 2015, access to affordable energy services is a prerequisite"".
the role of sustainable, clean renewable energy
To achieve the dramatic emissions cuts needed to avoid climate change ­ in the order of 80% in OECD countries by 2050 ­ will require a massive uptake of renewable energy. The targets for renewable energy must be greatly expanded in industrialised countries both to substitute for fossil fuel and nuclear generation and to create the necessary economies of scale necessary for global expansion. Within the Energy [R]evolution Scenario we assume that modern renewable energy sources, such as solar collectors, solar cookers and modern forms of bio energy, will replace inefficient, traditional biomass use.


scenarios for a future energy supply | BACKGROUND

Moving from principles to action on energy supply and climate change mitigation requires a long-term perspective. Energy infrastructure takes time to build up; new energy technologies take time to develop. Policy shifts often also need many years to have an effect. Any analysis that seeks to tackle energy and environmental
5 issues therefore needs to look ahead at least half a century.
Scenarios are important in describing possible development paths, to give decision-makers an overview of future perspectives and to indicate how far they can shape the future energy system. Two different scenarios are used here to characterise the wide range of possible paths for the future energy supply system: a Reference Scenario, reflecting a continuation of current trends and policies, and the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, which is designed to achieve a set of dedicated environmental policy targets.
The reference scenario is based on the Reference Scenario published by the International Energy Agency in World Energy Outlook 2007 (WEO 2007)18. This only takes existing international energy and environmental policies into account. The assumptions include, for example, continuing progress in electricity and gas market reforms, the liberalisation of cross-border energy trade and recent policies designed to combat environmental pollution. The Reference Scenario does not include additional policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As the IEA's scenario only covers a time horizon up to 2030, it has been extended by extrapolating its key macroeconomic indicators. This provides a baseline for comparison with the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.
The energy [r]evolution scenario has a key target for the reduction of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions down to a level of around 10 Gigatonnes per year by 2050 in order for the increase in global temperature to remain under +2°C. A second objective is the global phasing out of nuclear energy. To achieve these targets, the scenario is characterised by significant efforts to fully exploit the large potential for energy efficiency. At the same time, all costeffective renewable energy sources are used for heat and electricity generation as well as the production of bio fuels. The general framework parameters for population and GDP growth remain unchanged from the Reference Scenario.
These scenarios by no means claim to predict the future; they simply describe two potential development paths out of the broad range of possible `futures'. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario is designed to indicate the efforts and actions required to achieve its ambitious objectives and to illustrate the options we have at hand to change our energy supply system into one that is sustainable.

scenario background The scenarios in this report were jointly commissioned by Greenpeace and the European Renewable Energy Council from the Institute of Technical Thermodynamics, part of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The supply scenarios were calculated using the MESAP/PlaNet simulation model used for the previous Energy [R]evolution study19. Energy demand projections were developed by Ecofys Netherlands, based on an analysis of the future potential for energy efficiency measures. The biomass potential, using Greenpeace sustainability criteria, has been developed especially for this scenario by the German Biomass Research Centre. The future development pathway for car technologies is based on a special report produced in 2008 by the Institute of Vehicle Concepts, DLR for Greenpeace International.
energy efficiency study
The aim of the Ecofys study was to develop a low energy demand scenario for the period 2005 to 2050 for the IEA regions as defined in the World Energy Outlook report series. Calculations were made for each decade from 2010 onwards. Energy demand was split up into electricity and fuels. The sectors which were taken into account were industry, transport and other consumers, including households and services.
Under the low energy demand scenario, worldwide final energy demand is reduced by 38% in 2050 in comparison to the Reference Scenario, resulting in a final energy demand of 350 EJ (ExaJoules). The energy savings are fairly equally distributed over the three sectors of industry, transport and other uses. The most important energy saving options are efficient passenger and freight transport and improved heat insulation and building design. Chapter 11 provides more details about this study.

""moving from principles to action..""

the future for cars
The Institute of Vehicle Concepts in Stuttgart, Germany has developed a global scenario for cars covering ten world regions. The aim was to produce a demanding but feasible scenario to lower global car CO2 emissions within the context of the overall objectives of this report. The approach takes into account a vast range of technical measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles, but also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and annual mileage taking place in developing countries. The major parameters are vehicle technology, alternative fuels, changes in sales of different vehicle sizes (segment split) and changes in vehicle kilometres travelled (modal split).
The scenario assumes that a large share of renewable electricity will be available in the future. A combination of ambitious efforts towards higher efficiency in vehicle technologies, a major switch to grid-connected electric vehicles and incentives for vehicle users to save carbon dioxide lead to the conclusion that it is possible to reduce CO2 emissions from `well-to-wheel' in 2050 by roughly 25%20 compared to 1990 and 40% compared to 2005.

By 2050, 60% of the final energy used in transport will still come

from fossil sources, mainly gasoline and diesel. Renewable

electricity will cover 25%, bio fuels 13% and hydrogen 2%. Total

energy consumption in 2050 will be similar to the consumption in

2005, however, in spite of enormous increases in fuel use in some

regions of the world.

5

The peak in global CO2 emissions from transport occurs between 2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US and Europe will contribute to breaking the upwards trend in emissions. From 2020, the effect of introducing grid-connected electric cars can be clearly seen. Chapter 13 provides more details about this report.

the global potential for sustainable bio energy
As part of the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Greenpeace commissioned the German Biomass Research Centre (the former Institute for Energy and Environment) to look at the worldwide potential for energy crops up to 2050. A summary of this report can be found in Chapter 8.

references 20 THERE IS NO RELIABLE NUMBER AVAILABLE FOR GLOBAL LDV EMISSIONS IN 1990, SO A ROUGH ESTIMATE HAS BEEN MADE.
main scenario assumptions
Development of a global energy scenario requires the use of a multiregion model in order to reflect the significant structural differences between energy supply systems. The International Energy Agency
5 breakdown of world regions, as used in the ongoing series of World
Energy Outlook reports, has been chosen because the IEA also provides the most comprehensive global energy statistics21.

The previous Energy [R]evolution Scenario used three regions to cover Asia: East Asia, South Asia and China. In line with WEO 2007, this new edition maintains the three region approach, but assesses China and India separately and aggregates the remaining Non-OECD countries in Asia under `Developing Asia'. The loss of comparability with the previous study is outweighed by the ability to compare the new results with current IEA reports and still provides a reasonable analysis of Asia in terms of population and economic development. The definitions of the world regions are shown in Figure 5.1.


1. population development
One important underlying factor in energy scenario building is future population development. Population growth affects the size and composition of energy demand, directly and through its impact on economic growth and development. World Energy Outlook 2007 uses the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) projections for population development. For this study the most recent population projections from UNDP up to 2050 are applied22.
Table 5.1 summarises this study's assumptions on world population development.The world's population is expected to grow by 0.77 % on average over the period 2005 to 2050, from 6.5 billion people in 2005 to more than 9.1 billion in 2050. Population growth will slow over the projection period, from 1.2% during 2005-2010 to 0.4% during 20402050. However, the updated projections show an increase in population of almost 300 million compared to the previous edition.This will further increase the demand for energy. The population of the developing regions will continue to grow most rapidly.The Transition Economies will face a continuous decline, followed after a short while by the OECD Pacific countries. OECD Europe and OECD North America are expected to maintain their population, with a peak in around 2020/2030 and a slight decline afterwards. The share of the population living in today's NonOECD countries will increase from the current 82% to 86% in 2050. China's contribution to world population will drop from 20% today to 15% in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the highest growth rate, leading to a share of 21% of world population in 2050.
Satisfying the energy needs of a growing population in the developing regions of the world in an environmentally friendly manner is a key challenge for achieving a global sustainable energy supply.
2. economic growth
Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since 1971, each 1% increase in global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been accompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary energy consumption.The decoupling of energy demand and GDP growth is therefore a prerequisite for reducing demand in the future. Most global energy/economic/ environmental models constructed in the past have relied on market exchange rates to place countries in a common currency for estimation and calibration.This approach has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent years, and the alternative of purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates has been proposed. Purchasing power parities compare the costs in different currencies of a fixed basket of traded and non-traded goods and services and yield a widely-based measure of the standard of living.This is important in analysing the main drivers of energy demand or for comparing energy intensities among countries.
Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise compared to statistics based on national income and product trade and national price indexes, they are considered to provide a better basis for global scenario development.23 Thus all data on economic development in WEO 2007 refers to purchasing power adjusted GDP. However, as WEO 2007 only covers the time period up to 2030, the projections for 2030-2050 are based on our own estimates.

Prospects for GDP growth have increased considerably compared to

the previous study, whilst underlying growth trends continue much the

same. GDP growth in all regions is expected to slow gradually over the

coming decades. World GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.6%

per year over the period 2005-2030, compared to 3.3% from 1971 to

2002, and on average by 3.3 % per year over the entire modelling

period. China and India are expected to grow faster than other

regions, followed by the Developing Asia countries, Africa and the

Transition Economies. The Chinese economy will slow as it becomes

more mature, but will nonetheless become the largest in the world in

PPP terms early in the 2020s. GDP in OECD Europe and OECD

Pacific is assumed to grow by around 2% per year over the projection

period, while economic growth in OECD North America is expected to

be slightly higher. The OECD share of global PPP-adjusted GDP will

decrease from 55% in 2005 to 29% in 2050.

3. fossil fuel and biomass price projections
The recent dramatic increase in global oil prices has resulted in much higher forward price projections for fossil fuels. Under the 2004 `high oil and gas price' scenario from the European Commission, for example, an oil price of just $34 per barrel was assumed in 2030. More recent projections of oil prices in 2030 range from the IEA's $200662/bbl ($200560/bbl) (WEO 2007) up to $2006119/bbl ($2005115/bbl) in the `high price' scenario of the US Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2008.

Since the last Energy [R]evolution study was published, however, the price of oil has moved over $100/bbl for the first time (at the end of 2007), and in July 2008 reached a record high of more than $140/bbl. Although oil prices fell back to $100/bbl in September 2008, the above projections might still be considered too conservative. Considering the growing global demand for oil and gas we have assumed a price development path for fossil fuels in which the price of oil reaches $120/bbl by 2030 and $140/bbl in 2050.
As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of pipeline infrastructure, there is no world market price for natural gas. In most regions of the world the gas price is directly tied to the price of oil. Gas prices are assumed to increase to $20-25/GJ by 2050.

4. cost of CO2 emissions
Assuming that a CO2 emissions trading system is established in all world regions in the long term, the cost of CO2 allowances needs to be included in the calculation of electricity generation costs. Projections of emissions costs are even more uncertain than energy prices, and available studies span a broad range of future CO2 cost estimates. As in the previous Energy [R]evolution study we assume CO2 costs of $10/tCO2 in 2010, rising to $50/tCO2 in 2050. Additional CO2 costs are applied in Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex B (developing) countries only after 2020.



5. power plant investment costs
fossil fuel technologies and carbon capture and storage (CCS) While the fossil fuel power technologies in use today for coal, gas, lignite and oil are established and at an advanced stage of market development, further cost reduction potentials are assumed. The potential for cost reductions is limited, however, and will be achieved mainly through an increase in efficiency, bringing down investment costs24.
There is much speculation about the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to mitigate the effect of fossil fuel consumption on climate change, even though the technology is still under development.
CCS is a means of trapping CO2 from fossil fuels, either before or after they are burned, and `storing' (effectively disposing of) it in the sea or beneath the surface of the Earth. There are currently three different methods of capturing CO2: `pre-combustion', `postcombustion' and `oxyfuel combustion'. However, development is at a very early stage and CCS will not be implemented - in the best case - before 2020 and will probably not become commercially viable as a possible effective mitigation option until 2030.
Cost estimates for CCS vary considerably, depending on factors such as power station configuration, technology, fuel costs, size of project and location. One thing is certain, however, CCS is expensive. It requires significant funds to construct the power stations and the necessary infrastructure to transport and store carbon. The IPCC assesses costs at $15-75 per ton of captured CO225, while a recent US Department of Energy report found installing carbon capture systems to most modern plants resulted in a near doubling of costs26. These costs are estimated to increase the price of electricity in a range from 21-91%27.

Pipeline networks will also need to be constructed to move CO2 to storage sites. This is likely to require a considerable outlay of capital28. Costs will vary depending on a number of factors, including pipeline length, diameter and manufacture from corrosion-resistant steel, as well as the volume of CO2 to be
transported. Pipelines built near population centres or on difficult 5
terrain, such as marshy or rocky ground, are more expensive29.
The IPCC estimates a cost range for pipelines of $1-8/ton of CO2 transported. A United States Congressional Research Services report calculated capital costs for an 11 mile pipeline in the Midwestern region of the US at approximately $6 million. The same report estimates that a dedicated interstate pipeline network in North Carolina would cost upwards of $5 billion due to the limited geological sequestration potential in that part of the country30. Storage and subsequent monitoring and verification costs are estimated by the IPCC to range from $0.5-8/tCO2 injected and $0.1-0.3/tCO2 injected, respectively. The overall cost of CCS could therefore serve as a major barrier to its deployment31.
For the above reasons, CCS power plants are not included in our financial analysis.
Table 5.4 summarises our assumptions on the technical and economic parameters of future fossil-fuelled power plant technologies. In spite of growing raw material prices, we assume that further technical innovation will result in a moderate reduction of future investment costs as well as improved power plant efficiencies. These improvements are, however, outweighed by the expected increase in fossil fuel prices, resulting in a significant rise in electricity generation costs.

6. cost projections for renewable energy technologies
The range of renewable energy technologies available today display marked differences in terms of their technical maturity, costs and development potential. Whereas hydro power has been widely used
5 for decades, other technologies, such as the gasification of biomass,
have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some renewable sources by their very nature, including wind and solar power, provide a variable supply, requiring a revised coordination with the grid network. But although in many cases these are `distributed' technologies - their output being generated and used locally to the consumer - the future will also see large-scale applications in the form of offshore wind parks, photovoltaic power plants or concentrating solar power stations.
By using the individual advantages of the different technologies, and linking them with each other, a wide spectrum of available options can be developed to market maturity and integrated step by step into the existing supply structures. This will eventually provide a complementary portfolio of environmentally friendly technologies for heat and power supply and the provision of transport fuels.
Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the costs of electricity, heat and fuel production are generally higher than those of competing conventional systems - a reminder that the external (environmental and social) costs of conventional power production are not included in the market prices. It is expected, however, that compared with conventional technologies large cost reductions can be achieved through technical advances, manufacturing improvements and large-scale production. Especially when developing long-term scenarios spanning periods of several decades, the dynamic trend of cost developments over time plays a crucial role in identifying economically sensible expansion strategies.

To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have been applied which reflect the correlation between cumulative production volumes of a particular technology and a reduction in its costs. For many technologies, the learning factor (or progress ratio) falls in the range between 0.75 for less mature systems to 0.95 and higher for well-established technologies. A learning factor of 0.9 means that costs are expected to fall by 10% every time the cumulative output from the technology doubles. Empirical data shows, for example, that the learning factor for PV solar modules has been fairly constant at 0.8 over 30 years whilst that for wind energy varies from 0.75 in the UK to 0.94 in the more advanced German market.
Assumptions on future costs for renewable electricity technologies in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are derived from a review of learning curve studies, for example by Lena Neij and others32, from the analysis of recent technology foresight and road mapping studies, including the European Commission funded NEEDS (New Energy Externalities Developments for Sustainability)33 project or the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives 2008, and a discussion with experts from the renewable energy industry.

""large cost reductions can be achieved through technical advances, manufacturing improvements and large-scale production.""

photovoltaics (pv)
The worldwide photovoltaics (PV) market has been growing at over 35% per annum in recent years and the contribution it can make to electricity generation is starting to become significant. Development work is focused on improving existing modules and system components by increasing their energy efficiency and reducing material usage. Technologies like PV thin film (using alternative semiconductor materials) or dye sensitive solar cells are developing quickly and present a huge potential for cost reduction. The mature technology crystalline silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, is continually increasing its cell and module efficiency (by 0.5% annually), whereas the cell thickness is rapidly decreasing (from 230 to 180 microns over the last five years). Commercial module efficiency varies from 14 to 21% depending on silicon quality and fabrication process.
The learning factor for PV modules has been fairly constant over the last 30 years, with a cost reduction of 20% each time the installed capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of technical learning. Assuming a globally installed capacity of 1,600 GW by between 2030 and 2040, and with an electricity output of 2,600 TWh, we can expect that generation costs of around 5-10 cents/kWh (depending on the region) will be achieved. During the following five to ten years, PV will become competitive with retail electricity prices in many parts of the world and competitive with fossil fuel costs by 2050. The importance of photovoltaics comes from its decentralised/ centralised character, its flexibility for use in an urban environment and huge potential for cost reduction.

concentrating solar power (csp)

Solar thermal `concentrating' power stations (CSP) can only use

direct sunlight and are therefore dependent on high irradiation

locations. North Africa, for example, has a technical potential

which far exceeds local demand. The various solar thermal

5

technologies (parabolic trough, power towers and parabolic dish

concentrators) offer good prospects for further development and

cost reductions. Because of their more simple design, `Fresnel'

collectors are considered as an option for additional cost reduction.

The efficiency of central receiver systems can be increased by

producing compressed air at a temperature of up to 1,000°C, which

is then used to run a combined gas and steam turbine.

Thermal storage systems are a key component for reducing CSP electricity generation costs. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, for example, is equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity of 7.5 hours. A higher level of full load operation can be realised by using a thermal storage system and a large collector field. Although this leads to higher investment costs, it reduces the cost of electricity generation.

Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation, it is expected that long term future electricity generation costs of 6-10 cents/kWh can be achieved. This presupposes rapid market introduction in the next few years.

wind power
Within a short period of time, the dynamic development of wind power has resulted in the establishment of a flourishing global market. The world's largest wind turbines, several of which have
5 been installed in Germany, have a capacity of 6 MW. While
favourable policy incentives have made Europe the main driver for the global wind market, in 2007 more than half of the annual market was outside Europe. This trend is likely to continue. The boom in demand for wind power technology has nonetheless led to supply constraints. As a consequence, the cost of new systems has stagnated or even increased. Because of the continuous expansion of production capacities, the industry expects to resolve the bottlenecks in the supply chain over the next few years. Taking into account market development projections, learning curve analysis and industry expectations, we assume that investment costs for wind turbines will reduce by 30% for onshore and 50% for offshore installations up to 2050.

biomass
The crucial factor for the economics of biomass utilisation is the cost of the feedstock, which today ranges from a negative cost for waste wood (based on credit for waste disposal costs avoided) through inexpensive residual materials to the more expensive energy crops. The resulting spectrum of energy generation costs is correspondingly broad. One of the most economic options is the use of waste wood in steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP) plants. Gasification of solid biomass, on the other hand, which opens up a wide range of applications, is still relatively expensive. In the long term it is expected that favourable electricity production costs will be achieved by using wood gas both in micro CHP units (engines and fuel cells) and in gas-and-steam power plants. Great potential for the utilisation of solid biomass also exists for heat generation in both small and large heating centres linked to local heating networks. Converting crops into ethanol and `bio diesel' made from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) has become increasingly important in recent years, for example in Brazil, the USA and Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from biogenic synthesis gases will also play a larger role.
A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in Latin and North America, Europe and the Transition Economies, either in stationary appliances or the transport sector. In the long term Europe and the Transition Economies will realise 20-50% of the potential for biomass from energy crops, whilst biomass use in all the other regions will have to rely on forest residues, industrial wood waste and straw. In Latin America, North America and Africa in particular, an increasing residue potential will be available.
In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian regions, the additional use of biomass is restricted, either due to a generally low availability or already high traditional use. For the latter, using modern, more efficient technologies will improve the sustainability of current usage and have positive side effects, such as reducing indoor pollution and the heavy workloads currently associated with traditional biomass use.


geothermal
Geothermal energy has long been used worldwide for supplying heat, and since the beginning of the last century for electricity generation as well. Geothermally generated electricity was previously limited to sites with specific geological conditions, but further intensive research and development work has enabled the potential areas to be widened. In particular the creation of large underground heat exchange surfaces (Enhanced Geothermal Systems - EGS) and the improvement of low temperature power conversion, for example with the Organic Rankine Cycle, open up the possibility of producing geothermal electricity anyywhere. Advanced heat and power cogeneration plants will also improve the economics of geothermal electricity.
As a large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come from deep underground drilling, further development of innovative drilling technology is expected. Assuming a global average market growth for geothermal power capacity of 9% per year up to 2020, adjusting to 4% beyond 2030, the result would be a cost reduction potential of 50% by 2050:
· for conventional geothermal power, from 7 cents/kWh to about 2 cents/kWh.
· for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about 20 cents/kWh), electricity production costs - depending on the payments for heat supply - are expected to come down to around 5 cents/kWh in the long term.
Because of its non-fluctuating supply and a grid load operating almost 100% of the time, geothermal energy is considered to be a key element in a future supply structure based on renewable sources. Until now we have just used a marginal part of the geothermal heating and cooling potential. Shallow geothermal drilling makes possible the delivery of heating and cooling at any time anywhere, and can be used for thermal energy storage.

ocean energy
Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a significant resource, and has the potential to satisfy an important percentage of electricity supply worldwide. Globally, the potential of ocean energy
has been estimated at around 90,000 TWh/year. The most significant 5
advantages are the vast availability and high predictability of the resource and a technology with very low visual impact and no CO2 emissions. Many different concepts and devices have been developed, including taking energy from the tides, waves, currents and both thermal and saline gradient resources. Many of them are in an advanced phase of R&D, large scale prototypes have been deployed in real sea conditions and some have reached pre-market deployment. There are a few grid connected, fully operational commercial wave and tidal generating plants.
The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms has been estimated to be in the range of 15-55 cents/kWh, and for initial tidal stream farms in the range of 11-22 cents/kWh. Generation costs of 10-25 cents/kWh are expected by 2020. Key areas for development will include concept design, optimisation of the device configuration, reduction of capital costs by exploring the use of alternative structural materials, economies of scale and learning from operation. According to the latest research findings, the learning factor is estimated to be 10-15% for offshore wave and 5-10% for tidal stream. In the medium term, ocean energy has the potential to become one of the most competitive and cost effective forms of generation. In the next few years a dynamic market penetration is expected, following a similar curve to wind energy.
Because of the early development stage any future cost estimates for ocean energy systems are uncertain, and no learning curve data is available. Present cost estimates are based on analysis from the European NEEDS project34.

scenarios for a future energy supply | MAIN SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS



hydro power
Hydropower is a mature technology with a significant part of its potential already exploited. There is still, however, some potential left both for new schemes (especially small scale run-of-river
5 projects with little or no reservoir impoundment) and for
repowering of existing sites. The significance of hydropower is also likely to be encouraged by the increasing need for flood control and maintenance of water supply during dry periods. The future is in sustainable hydropower which makes an effort to integrate plants with river ecosystems while reconciling ecology with economically attractive power generation.

summary of renewable energy cost development
Figure 5.4 summarises the cost trends for renewable energy technologies as derived from the respective learning curves. It should be emphasised that the expected cost reduction is basically not a function of time, but of cumulative capacity, so dynamic market development is required. Most of the technologies will be able to reduce their specific investment costs to between 30% and 70% of current levels by 2020, and to between 20% and 60% once they have achieved full development (after 2040).
Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies lead directly to reduced heat and electricity generation costs, as shown in Figure 5.5. Generation costs today are around 8 to 25 cents/kWh (10-25 $cents/kWh) for the most important technologies, with the exception of photovoltaics. In the long term, costs are expected to converge at around 4 to 10 cents/kWh (5-12 $cents/kWh). These estimates depend on site-specific conditions such as the local wind regime or solar irradiation, the availability of biomass at reasonable prices or the credit granted for heat supply in the case of combined heat and power generation.


The development of future global energy demand is determined by three key factors:
6 · Population development: the number of people consuming energy
or using energy services.
· Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most commonly used indicator. In general, an increase in GDP triggers an increase in energy demand.
· Energy intensity: how much energy is required to produce a unit of GDP.
Both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios are based on the same projections of population and economic development. The future development of energy intensity, however, differs between the two, taking into account the measures to increase energy efficiency under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.

global: projection of energy intensity
An increase in economic activity and a growing population does not necessarily have to result in an equivalent increase in energy demand. There is still a large potential for exploiting energy efficiency measures. Under the Reference Scenario, we assume that energy intensity will be reduced by 1.25% on average per year, leading to a reduction in final energy demand per unit of GDP of about 56% between 2005 and 2050. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, it is assumed that active policy and technical support for energy efficiency measures will lead to an even higher reduction in energy intensity of almost 73%.

global: development of energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth and energy intensity results in future development pathways for the world's energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.4 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand almost doubles from 474,900 PJ/a in 2005 to 867,700 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand increases up to 2015 by 16% and decreases to close to today's level of 480,860 PJ in 2050.

The accelerated increase in energy efficiency, which is a crucial prerequisite for achieving a sufficiently large share of renewable energy sources in our energy supply, is beneficial not only for the environment but also for economics. Taking into account the full service life, in most cases the implementation of energy efficiency measures saves costs compared to an additional energy supply. The mobilisation of cost-effective energy saving potential leads directly
to a reduction in costs. A dedicated energy efficiency strategy thus 6
also helps to compensate in part for the additional costs required during the market introduction phase of renewable energy sources.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately, with households and services the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.5). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 30,800 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 12,800 TWh/a.This reduction in energy demand can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the best available technology in all demand sectors. Employment of solar architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will help to curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced

(see Figure 6.6). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 46,000 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and `passive houses' for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will increase by 12 % to around 94,000 PJ/a in 2015 and will fall slightly afterwards down to 83,300 PJ/a in 2050, saving 100,000 PJ compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.


key results | GLOBAL - ELECTRICITY GENERATION

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a

6

dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of

nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants

required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 77% of the electricity

produced worldwide will come from renewable energy sources.

`New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will

contribute over 60% of electricity generation. The following strategy

paves the way for a future renewable energy supply:

· The phasing out of nuclear energy and rising electricity demand will be met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficient gas-fired combined-cycle power plants, plus an increasing capacity of wind turbines, biomass, concentrating solar power plants and solar photovoltaics. In the long term, wind will be the most important single source of electricity generation.

· Solar energy, hydro and biomass will make substantial contributions to electricity generation. In particular, as non-fluctuating renewable energy sources, hydro and solar thermal, combined with efficient heat storage, are important elements in the overall generation mix.

· The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 1,000 GW to 9,100 GW in 2050. Increasing renewable capacity by a factor of nine within the next 42 years requires political support and well-designed policy instruments, however. There will be a considerable demand for investment in new production capacity over the next 20 years. As investment cycles in the power sector are long, decisions on restructuring the world's energy supply system need to be taken now.

To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of great importance. This mobilisation depends on technical potentials, cost reduction and technological maturity. Figure 21 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the major contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaic and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

key results | GLOBAL - COSTS - HEATING & COOLING

global: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 27 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be less than 0.2 cents/kWh up to 2020. Note that any increase in fossil fuel prices beyond the projection given in Table 6.1 will reduce the gap between the two scenarios. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, by 2020 electricity generation costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costs will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Due to growing demand, we face a significant increase in society's expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $1,750 billion per year to more than $7,300 bn in 2050. Figure 28 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with global CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario. It becomes clear that pursuing stringent environmental targets in the energy sector also pays off in terms of economics.

global: heat and cooling supply

Development of renewables in the heat supply sector raises

different issues. Today, renewables provide 24%of primary energy

demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use

of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severe

structural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal and

solar thermal energy. Past experience shows that it is easier to

implement effective support instruments in the grid-connected

6

electricity sector than in the heat market, with its multitude of

different actors. Dedicated support instruments are required to

ensure a dynamic development.

In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables satisfy more than 70% of the total global heating demand in 2050.

· Energy efficiency measures can decrease the current per capita demand for heat supply by 30% in spite of improving living standards.

· For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as geothermal energy will increasingly substitute for fossil fuel-fired systems.

· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.


key results | GLOBAL - TRANSPORT - CONSUMPTION - CO2 EMISSIONS

In the transport sector, it is assumed that under the Energy
6 [R]evolution Scenario, due to fast growing demand for services,
energy demand will further increase up to 2015. After that demand will decrease, falling to below its current level in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, energy demand is reduced by 54%. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns. By implementing attractive alternatives to individual cars, the amount of cars will grow more slowly than in the Reference Scenario. In 2050, electricity will provide 24% of the transport sector's total energy demand, while 61% of the demand will be covered by fossil fuels.

· NATURAL GAS ·· OIL PRODUCTS

Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shown in Figure 6.13. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energy demand will be reduced by almost 45% in 2050. More than half of the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources. Note that because of the `efficiency method' used for the calculation of primary energy consumption, which postulates that the amount of electricity generation from hydro, wind, solar and geothermal energy equals the primary energy consumption, the share of renewables seems to be lower than their actual importance as energy suppliers.

development of global CO2 emissions
Whilst worldwide emissions of CO2 will almost double under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 24,350 million tonnes in 2005 to 10,600 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.7 tonnes to 1.15 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 35% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will fall significantly but remain the largest source of emissions, followed by transport.

The Energy [R]evolution Scenario for the USA shows that it is

possible to reduce per capita CO2 emissions from 19 tonnes now to

3 tonnes by 2050. For the EU-27 countries, per capita emissions

will fall from 8 to just under 2 tonnes per capita. Developing

countries such as the Philippines could even keep per capita emissions at their current level of about 1 tonne of CO2 until 2050, while maintaining economic growth. A combination of efficiency standards and renewable energy development proves to be the most

oecd north america: energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
6 and energy intensity results in future development pathways for
North America's energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.18 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand increases by more than 40% from the current 115,900 PJ/a to 164,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, primary energy demand decreases by 33% compared to current consumption and is expected by 2050 to reach 77,700 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to decrease in the industry sector, but to grow in the transport as well as in the residential and service sectors (see Figure 6.19). Total electricity demand will rise to 5,730 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 2,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the best available technology in all demand sectors. Employment of solar

architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will help to curb the growing demand for active air-conditioning.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand for heat supply will grow up to 2030, but after that can even be reduced to below the current level (see Figure 6.20). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 7,850 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and `passive houses' for new buildings, enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will decrease by half to 16,720 PJ/a by 2050, saving 65% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

oecd north america: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 94% of the electricity produced in OECD North America will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute over 85% of electricity generation.
Figure 6.22 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable technologies in OECD North America over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.


oecd north america: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.23 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs
of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be less than 0.4 cents/kWh up to 2020. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, by 2020 electricity generation costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 generation costs will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $420 billion per year to more than $1,350 bn in 2050. Figure 6.24 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with OECD North America CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

oecd north america: heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide 11% of North America's primary energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass. The lack of district heating networks is a severe structural barrier to the large scale utilisation of geothermal and solar thermal energy. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 69% of North America's total heating demand in 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently growing demand for heating and cooling, in spite of improving living standards.
· For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuelfired systems.
· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.
oecd north america: transport
A key initiative in North America is to introduce incentives to drive smaller cars, which today are virtually non-existant. In addition, a shift to efficient modes of transport like rail, light rail and bus is important, especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas. Together with the rising price of fossil fuels, these changes reduce the huge growth in car sales projected by the Reference Scenario. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, the car fleet still grows by 20% from the year 2000 to 2050. However the energy demand of the transport sector is reduced by 47%. Highly efficient propulsion technology, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric powertrains, will bring large efficiency gains. A quarter of the transport energy demand by 2050 is covered by electricity, 30% by bio fuels.


oecd north america: development of CO2 emissions
Whilst North America's emissions of CO2 will increase by 42% under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 6,430 million tonnes in 2005 to 1,060 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 14.7 tonnes to 1.8 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in the transport sector will even reduce CO2 emissions there. With a share of 46% of total CO2, the transport sector will be the largest source of emissions in 2050.

latin america: energy demand by sector
Combining the projections on population development, GDP growth
6 and energy intensity results in future development pathways for
Latin America's energy demand. These are shown in Figure 6.29 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current 21,140 PJ/a to 52,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a smaller 54% increase on current consumption is expected by 2050, reaching 32,500 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately, with households and services the main source of growing consumption. This is due to wider access to energy services in developing countries (see Figure 6.30). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase

can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 2,150 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 660 TWh/a. This reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices. Employment of solar architecture in both residential and commercial buildings will help to curb the growing demand for air-conditioning.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced (see Figure 6.31). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 2,400 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will increase by a fifth to 6,100 PJ/a by 2050, saving 50% compared to the Reference Scenario.


latin america: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by an increasing share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 95% of the electricity produced in Latin America will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute more than 60% of electricity generation. The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 139 GW to 695 GW in 2050 - increasing renewable capacity by a factor of five within the next 42 years.
Figure 6.33 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

latin america: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.34 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 generation costs will be more than 8 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $70 billion per year to more than $551 bn in 2050. Figure 6.35 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Latin America's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

latin america: heat and cooling supply
Today, renewables provide around 40% of primary energy demand for heat supply in Latin America, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass. The availability of less efficient but cheap appliances is a severe structural barrier to efficiency gains. Large-scale utilisation of geothermal and solar thermal energy for heat supply will be largely restricted to the industrial sector.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 83% of Latin America's total heating and cooling demand in 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures restrict the future primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply to a 60% increase, in spite of improving living standards.
· In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil fuel-fired heating systems.
· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

latin america: development of CO2 emissions
Whilst Latin America's emissions of CO2 will almost triple under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 830 million tonnes in 2005 to 370 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.8 tonnes to 0.6 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 53% of total CO2 in 2050, the transport sector will remain the largest source of emissions.

oecd europe: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for Europe's energy demand are
6 shown in Figure 6.40 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution
Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand in OECD Europe increases by more than 10% from the current 81,500 PJ/a to 90,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand decreases by 40% compared to current consumption, reaching 48,900 PJ/a by the end of the scenario period.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in all three sectors is expected to decrease after 2015 (see Figure 6.41). Because of the growing use of electric vehicles, however, electricity use for transport increases to 3,520 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 1,460 TWh/a. This reduction in energy demand can be achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the best available technology.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced (see Figure 6.42). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 7,350 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050. As a result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of residential buildings, as well as the introduction of low energy standards and new `passive houses', enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be accompanied by a much lower future energy demand.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will decrease by almost half to 8700 PJ/a by 2050, saving 58% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour patterns.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy market. This will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 86% of the electricity produced in OECD Europe will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute 67%.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 250 GW to 1,030 GW in 2050, increasing renewables capacity by a factor of four. Figure 6.44 shows the evolution of the different renewable technologies. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.
None of these numbers describe a maximum feasibility, but a possible balanced approach. With the right policy development, the solar industry believes that a much further uptake could happen. This is particularly true for concentrated solar power (CSP) which could unfold to 30GW already by 2020 and more than 120GW in 2050. The photovoltaic industry believes in a possible electricity generation capacity of 350GW by 2020 in Europe alone, assuming the necessary policy changes.



oecd europe: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.45 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of
electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be less than 0.4 cents/kWh up to 2020, however. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, electricity generation costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario by 2020, and by 2050 costs will be more than 3 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $330 billion per year to more than $800 bn in 2050. Figure 6.46 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with OECD Europe CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.

Future development pathways for Africa's energy demand are shown in
6 Figure 6.51 for both the Reference and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios.
Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current 25,200 PJ/a to 53,300 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a much smaller 50% increase on current consumption is expected by 2050 to reach 38,300 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in Africa is expected to increase disproportionately, with households and services the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.52). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 1,340 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 620 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced (see Figure 6.53). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 550 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will almost double to 5,300 PJ/a by 2050, still saving 46% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 73% of the electricity produced in Africa will come from renewable energy sources. A main driver for the development of solar power generation capacities will be the export of solar electricity to OECD Europe. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute more than 60% of electricity generation.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 21 GW to 388 GW in 2050, increasing renewable capacity by a factor of 18 over the next 42 years. More than 60 GW CSP plants will produce electricity for export to Europe.
Figure 6.55 shows the comparative evolution of different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors to the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.

Figure 6.56 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation. Because of the lower CO2 intensity, electricity generation costs will steadily become more economic under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be more than 9 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, by contrast, unchecked demand growth, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $59 billion per year to more than $468 bn in 2050. Figure 6.57 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Africa's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs.

key results | AFRICA - TRANSPORT - CONSUMPTION - CO2 EMISSIONS

africa: transport
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will almost double to 5,300 PJ/a by 2050, still saving 46% compared to the Reference Scenario.This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobility-related behaviour.The African car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 6 to roughly 100 million vehicles. Development of fuel efficiency is delayed by 20 years compared to other world regions for economic reasons. By 2050, Africa will still have the lowest average fuel consumption.

africa: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 6
is shown in Figure 6.60. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energy demand will be reduced by about 30% in 2050. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Africa's energy demand will increase from 25,200 PJ/a to 38,300 PJ/a in 2050. Around 56% of this demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.

africa: development of CO2 emissions
While Africa's emissions of CO2 will almost triple under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will increase from 780 million tonnes in 2003 to 895 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 0.8 tonnes to 0.45 t. In spite of increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of bio fuels and electricity will reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 28% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will drop below transport as the largest source of emissions.

middle east: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for the Middle East's energy
6 demand are shown in Figure 6.62 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current 21,400 PJ/a to 54,980 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a much smaller 28% increase on current consumption is expected by 2050, reaching 27,600 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately, with households and services the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.63), leading to an electricity demand of around 1,620 TWh/a in the year 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 390 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario (see Figure 6.64), consumption equivalent to 2,650 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will be slightly reduced compared to today's level, reaching 3,990 PJ/a by 2050, a saving of 49% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, by shifting the transport of goods from road to rail and by changes in mobilityrelated behaviour patterns.

The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by an increasing share of renewable electricity. By 2050, 95% of the electricity produced in the Middle East will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute about 90% of electricity generation.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 10 GW to 556 GW in 2050, a very large increase over the next 42 years requiring political support and well-designed policy instruments. Figure 6.66 shows the comparative evolution of the different technologies over the period up to 2050.


middle east: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.67 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario will lead to a significant
reduction of electricity generation costs. Under the Reference Scenario, on the other hand, the unchecked growth in demand, increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $133 billion per year to more than $870 bn in 2050. Figure 6.68 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only meets the Middle East's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Long term costs for electricity supply are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

middle east: heat and cooling supply
Renewables currently provide only 1% of primary energy demand for heat and cooling in the Middle East, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass and solar collectors. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables satisfy 83% of the Middle East's total heating and cooling demand in 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply to a doubling rather than tripling, in spite of improving living standards.
· In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for conventional fossil-fired heating systems.

middle east: transport
Traditionally, in a region with major oil resources, transport has been powered 100% by fossil fuels. Rising prices, together with other incentives, lead to a projected share of 27% of renewable electricity in this sector. Highly efficient electrified cars ­ plug-in-hybrid and battery vehicles ­ contribute to a total energy saving of 16%, although the car fleet is still projected to grow by a factor of 5 by 2050. The further promotion of energy efficient transport modes will help to reduce annual vehicle kilometres travelled by 0.25% p.a.

middle east: development of CO2 emissions
While CO2 emissions in the Middle East will triple under the Reference Scenario by 2050, and are thus far removed from a sustainable development path, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 1,170 million tonnes in 2005 to 390 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 6.2 tonnes/capita to 1.1 t. In spite of an increasing electricity demand, CO2 emissions will decrease strongly in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector.

transition economies: energy demand by sector
Future development pathways for energy demand in the Transition
6 Economies are shown in Figure 6.73 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand increases by 38 % from the current 46,250 PJ/a to 63,930 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, demand decreases by 23% compared to current consumption and is expected to reach 35,760 PJ/a by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately, with transport and the households and services sectors being the main source of growing consumption (see Figure 6.74). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading

to electricity demand of around 1,550 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 560 TWh/a.
Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced after 2030 (see Figure 6.75). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 5,990 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 28% to 4,240 PJ/a by 2050, saving 57% compared to the Reference Scenario.

transition economies: electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by a growing renewable energy market. This will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuelfired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 81% of the electricity produced in the Transition Economy countries will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute 65% of electricity generation.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 93 GW to 550 GW in 2050, increasing capacity by a factor of six over the next 42 years. This will require political support and well-designed policy instruments.
Figure 6.77 shows the expansion rate of the different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and geothermal energy.


transition economies: future costs of electricity generation
6 Figure 6.78 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies under
the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. This difference will be about 0.5 cents/kWh in 2015. Because of the lower CO2 intensity of electricity generation, by 2020 these costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Due to growing demand, there will be a significant increase in society's expenditure on electricity supply. Under the Reference Scenario, total electricity supply costs will rise from today's $190 billion per year to $520 bn in 2050. Figure 6.79 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with the Transition Economies' CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society. Long term costs for electricity supply are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.
transition economies: heat and cooling supply
Renewables currently provide just 3% of the Transition Economies' primary energy demand for heat supply, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass. The lack of available infrastructure for modern and efficient district heating networks is a barrier to the large scale utilisation of biomass, geothermal and solar thermal energy. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 75% of the Transition Economies' total heating demand in 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures can moderate the increase in heat demand, and in spite of improving living standards after 2030 lead to a decrease in demand, which in 2050 is slightly lower than at present.
· For direct heating, solar collectors, biomass/biogas as well as geothermal energy are increasingly substituting for fossil fuelfired systems.
· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications will lead to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

(`EFFICIENCY' = REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SCENARIO)
transition economies: transport
Development of the transport sector is characterised by the diversification of energy sources towards bio fuels (9%) and electricity (28%) up to 2050. The time taken to reach reference target levels for efficient vehicles is delayed by ten years compared to the most other industrialised countries. Although the light duty vehicle stock will triple by 2050, increasingly attractive and highly efficient suburban and long distance rail services, as well as growing fuel prices, will lead to the vehicle kilometres travelled falling by 10% between 2010 and 2050. These measures and incentives, together with highly efficient cars, will result in nearly 30% energy savings in the transport sector.
figure 6.81: transition economies: transport under the two scenarios
(`EFFICIENCY' = REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SCENARIO)
transition economies: development of CO2 emissions
Whilst emissions of CO2 will increase by 11% under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 2,380 million tonnes in 2005 to 540 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 7.0 tonnes to 1.8 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector.

transition economies: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the changes outlined above, the resulting primary
energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is shown 6
in Figure 6.82. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall energy demand will be reduced by 44% in 2050. Around 60% of the remaining demand will be covered by renewable energy sources.


india: energy demand by sector
The potential future development pathways for India's primary
6 energy demand are shown in Figure 6.84 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand quadruples from the current 22,300 PJ/a to 89,100 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, by contrast, demand will increase by about 230 % and is expected to reach 52,000 PJ/a by 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase substantially (see Figure 6.85). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, a higher increase can be avoided, leading to demand of around 3,500 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 1,410 TWh/a. This reduction can be achieved in

particular by introducing highly efficient electronic devices using the best available technology in all demand sectors.
Efficiency gains for heat and cooling supply are also significant. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heating and cooling can even be reduced (see Figure 6.86). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 3,130 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.
In the transport sector it is assumed that a fast growing economy will see energy demand, even under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, increase dramatically - from 1,550 PJ/a in 2005 to 8,700 PJ/a by 2050. This still saves 50% compared to the Reference Scenario. This reduction can be achieved by the introduction of highly efficient vehicles, shifting freight transport from road to rail and by changes in travel behaviour.

india: electricity generation
By 2050, about 60% of the electricity produced in India will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute almost 50%. The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 38 GW to 915 GW in 2050, a substantial increase over the next 42 years.
Figure 6.88 shows the comparative evolution of different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2030, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.


india: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.89 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the
future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. Because of the lower CO2 intensity, electricity generation costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and by 2050 will be more than 4.5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, a massive growth in demand, increased fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $64 billion per year to more than $930 bn in 2050. Figure 6.90 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with India's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

india: heat and cooling supply
Renewables presently provide 63% of primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply in India, the main contribution coming from the use of biomass. Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables will provide 71% of India's heating and cooling demand by 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures will restrict future primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply to an increase of 90% by 2005, in spite of improving living standards. This compares to 130% in the Reference Scenario.
· In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossilfired heating systems.
· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

india: transport
India's car fleet is projected to grow by a factor of 16 from 2000 to 2050. Presently characterised by small cars (70%), this will stay the same up to 2050. Although India will remain a low price car market, the key to efficiency lies in electrified powertrains (hybrid, plug-in and battery electric). Biofuels will take over 6% and electricity 22% of total transport energy demand. Stringent energy efficiency measures will help limit growth of transport energy demand by 2050 to about a factor of 5.5 compared to 2005.

india: primary energy consumption

Taking into account the above assumptions, the resulting primary

energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is

6

shown in Figure 6.93. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall

demand will be reduced by about 40% in 2050. Around half of this

will be covered by renewable energy sources.


india: development of CO2 emissions
While CO2 emissions in India will increase under the Reference Scenario by a factor of 5.4 up to 2050, and are thus far removed from a sustainable development path, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will increase from the current 1,074 million tonnes in 2005 to reach a peak of 1,820 m/t in 2030. After that they will decrease to 1,660 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will increase to 1.3 tonnes/capita in 2030 and fall again to 1.0 t/capita in 2050. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing electricity demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector.
After 2030, efficiency gains and the increased use of renewables in all sectors will soften the still increasing CO2 emissions in transport, the power sector and industry. Although its share is decreasing, the power sector will remain the largest source of emissions in India, contributing 50% of the total in 2050, followed by transport.
developing asia: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for Developing Asia's primary
6 energy demand are shown in Figure 6.95 for both the Reference
and Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand more than doubles from the current 31,100 PJ/a to 67,400 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, a much smaller 40% increase in consumption is expected by 2050, reaching 43,800 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately in Developing Asia (see Figure 6.96). With the introduction of serious efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading to electricity demand of around 1,965 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 860 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are also significant (see Figure 6.97). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 2,900 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency measures by 2050. In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will rise to 8,300 PJ/a by 2050, saving 90% compared to the Reference Scenario.

 electricity generation
The development of the electricity supply sector is characterised by an increasing share of renewable electricity. This will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required. By 2050, 67% of the electricity produced in Developing Asia will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute 55%.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 51 GW to 590 GW in 2050, increasing capacity by a factor of more than ten.
Figure 6.99 shows the comparative evolution of the different technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and geothermal sources.


developing asia: future costs of electricity generation
6 Figure 6.100 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario significantly decreases the future costs of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. Because of lower CO2 intensity in electricity generation, costs will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. By 2050 they will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, unchecked growth in demand, an increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $98 billion per year to more than $566 bn in 2050. Figure 6.101 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with Developing Asia's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting supply to renewables leads to long term costs that are almost one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.
developing asia: heat and cooling supply
The starting point for renewables in the heat supply sector is quite different from the power sector. Today, renewables provide 53% of primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply in Developing Asia, the main contribution coming from biomass. Dedicated support instruments are still required to ensure a continuously dynamic development of renewables in the heat market.
In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, renewables provide 70% of Developing Asia's heating and cooling demand in 2050.
· Energy efficiency measures can restrict the future primary energy demand for heat and cooling supply to a increase of 48%, compared to 77% in the Reference Scenario, in spite of improving living standards.
· In the industry sector solar collectors, biomass/biogas and geothermal energy are increasingly replacing conventional fossil fuel-fired heating systems.
· A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining conventional applications leads to a further reduction of CO2 emissions.

developing asia: transport
This region's light duty vehicle stock is projected to grow by a factor of 10 from 2000 to 2050. Biofuels will reach a share of 7%, electricity 9% of the energy needed in the total transport sector. Highly efficient hybrid car technologies, together with plug-in and battery electric vehicles, will lead to significant gains in energy efficiency.

developing asia: primary energy consumption
Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the resulting
primary energy consumption under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario 6
is shown in Figure 6.104. Compared to the Reference Scenario, overall demand will be reduced by almost 35% in 2050. Around half of the remaining demand will be covered by renewables.

developing asia: development of CO2 emissions
Whilst Developing Asia's CO2 emissions will increase by a factor of 2.5 under the Reference Scenario, in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 1,300 million tonnes in 2005 to 1,150 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.3 tonnes to 0.8 t. In spite of the phasing out of nuclear energy and increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles will stabilise CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 22% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will drop below transport as the largest source of emissions.

china: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for China's primary energy
6 demand are shown in Figure 6.106 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand will increase by a factor of 2.5 from the current 73,000 PJ/a to 185,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, primary energy demand increases up to 2030 by 60% and decreases to a level of 99,150 PJ/a in 2050.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand is expected to increase disproportionately (see Figure 6.107). With the exploitation of efficiency measures, however, an even higher increase can be avoided, leading to demand of around 7,500 TWh/a in 2050. Compared to the Reference Scenario, efficiency measures avoid the generation of about 3,160 TWh/a.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are large as well. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced (see Figure 6.108). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 10,300 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will increase considerably, from 5,100 PJ/a in 2005 to 17,300 PJ/a by 2050. However this still saves 50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

china: electricity generation
A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 63% of the electricity produced in China will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute 46% of electricity generation. The following strategy paves the way for a future renewable energy supply:
Rising electricity demand will be met initially by bringing into operation new highly efficient gas-fired combined-cycle power plants, plus an increasing capacity of wind turbines and biomass. In the long term, wind will be the most important single source of electricity generation. Solar energy, hydro-power and biomass will also make substantial contributions.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 119 GW to 1,950 GW in 2050, an enormous increase resulting in a considerable demand for investment over the next 20 years. Figure 6.110 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewable technologies over time. Up to 2020, hydropower and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal energy.

china: future costs of electricity generation
Figure 6.111 shows that the introduction of renewable technologies
6 under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario slightly increases the costs
of electricity generation compared to the Reference Scenario. The difference will be less than 1 cents/kWh up to 2020. Because of the lower CO2 intensity, by 2020 electricity generation costs in China will become economically favourable under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, and by 2050 will be more than 5 cents/kWh below those in the Reference Scenario.
Under the Reference Scenario, the unchecked growth in demand, the increase in fossil fuel prices and the cost of CO2 emissions result in total electricity supply costs rising from today's $ 205 billion per year to more than $ 1,940 bn in 2050. Figure 6.112 shows that the Energy [R]evolution Scenario not only complies with China's CO2 reduction targets but also helps to stabilise energy costs. Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables leads to long term costs for electricity supply that are one third lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Whilst China's emissions of CO2 will almost triple under the Reference Scenario, under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario they will decrease from 4,400 million tonnes in 2005 to 3,200 m/t in 2050. Annual per capita emissions will drop from 3.4 tonnes to 2.3 t. In spite of increasing demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 50% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will remain the largest source of emissions.
oecd pacific: energy demand by sector
The future development pathways for the OECD Pacific's primary
6 energy demand are shown in Figure 6.117 for both the Reference and
Energy [R]evolution Scenarios. Under the Reference Scenario, total primary energy demand increases by 27% - from the current 37,040 PJ/a to 47,020 PJ/a in 2050. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, by contrast, primary energy demand decreases by 33% compared to current consumption and is expected by 2050 to reach 24,950 PJ/a.
Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, electricity demand in the industry as well as the residential and services sectors is expected to fall slightly below the current level of demand (see Figure 6.118). The growing use of electric vehicles however leads to an increase in electricity demand, reaching 1,920 TWh/a in 2050. Overall demand is still 560 TWh/a lower than in the Reference Scenario.

Efficiency gains in the heat supply sector are even larger. Under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, final demand for heat supply can even be reduced (see Figure 6.119). Compared to the Reference Scenario, consumption equivalent to 2,860 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050.
In the transport sector, it is assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that energy demand will decrease by 40% to 4,000 PJ/a by 2050, saving about 50% compared to the Reference Scenario.

oecd pacific: electricity generation
A dynamically growing renewable energy market will compensate for the phasing out of nuclear energy and reduce the number of fossil fuel-fired power plants required for grid stabilisation. By 2050, 78% of the electricity produced in the OECD Pacific will come from renewable energy sources. `New' renewables ­ mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV ­ will contribute 68%.
The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 62 GW to more than 600 GW in 2050, an increase by a factor of ten.
To achieve an economically attractive growth in renewable energy sources, a balanced and timely mobilisation of all technologies is of great importance. Figure 6.121 shows the comparative evolution of the different renewables over time. Up to 2020, hydro-power and wind will remain the main contributors. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaic and solar thermal energy.

oecd pacific: transport
The low duty vehicles (LDV) market in OECD Pacific is driven by Japan, with a unique share of small cars and a fuel consumption average of 6.45 litres/100 km in the new car fleet. Other countries in the region typically drive larger cars, and incentives to encourage smaller cars will be crucial. The LDV stock is projected to grow by a factor of 1.4 to 119 million vehicles. While 94% of all LDVs use petrol today, electrified vehicles will play a key role, especially in Japan's well suited small cars, in reducing energy demand. By 2050, 35% of total transport energy is covered by electricity and 25% by bio fuels.

Annual per capita emissions will fall from 9.5 tonnes to 2.4 t. In the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles will even reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. With a share of 45% of total CO2 in 2050, the power sector will remain the largest source of emissions.

global market overview
The global market for renewable energy has been expanding in recent years at a record rate, an indication of its potential to realise the future targets outlined in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.
· Renewable electricity generation capacity reached an estimated 240 Gigawatts (GW) worldwide in 2007, an increase of 50 % over 2004. Renewables represent 5 % of global power capacity and 3.4 % of global power generation. These figures exclude large hydropower, which alone accounted for 15 % of global power generation.
· Renewable energy (excluding large hydropower) generated as much electric power worldwide in 2006 as one-quarter of the world's nuclear power plants.
· The largest component of renewable generation capacity is wind power, which grew by 28 % worldwide in 2007 to reach 95 GW. The annual capacity growth rate is even higher: 40 % more in 2007 than the year before.
· The fastest growing energy technology in the world is grid-connected solar photovoltaics (PV), with a 50 % annual increase in cumulative installed capacity in both 2006 and 2007 to reach 7.7 GW. This translates into 1.5 million homes with rooftop solar PV feeding into the grid.
· Rooftop solar heat collectors provide hot water to nearly 50 million households worldwide, and space heating to a growing number of homes. Existing solar hot water/heating capacity increased by 19 % in 2006 to reach 105 Gigawatts thermal (GWth) globally.
· The use of biomass and geothermal energy for both power and heating has been increasing in a number of countries, including for district heating networks. More than 2 million ground source heat pumps are now used in 30 countries to heat (and cool) buildings.
· Renewable energy, in particular small hydropower, biomass and solar PV, is providing electricity, heat, motive power and water pumping for tens of millions of people in the rural areas of developing countries, serving agriculture, small industry, homes and schools. 25 million households cook and light their homes with biogas and 2.5 million households use solar lighting systems.
· Developing countries account for more than 40 % of existing renewable power capacity, more than 70 % of solar hot water capacity and 45 % of bio fuels production.
In terms of investment, an estimated $71 billion was invested in new renewable power and heating capacity worldwide in 2007 (excluding large hydropower). Of this, 47 % was for wind power and 30 % for solar PV. Investment in large hydropower, the most established renewable energy source, added a further $15­20 billion. The total amount invested in new renewable energy capacity, manufacturing plants and research and development during 2007 is estimated to have reached a record $100 billion.

Investment flows have also became more diversified and mainstream, with funding flowing from a wide range of sources, including major commercial and investment banks, venture capital and private equity investors, multilateral and bilateral development organisations as well as smaller local financiers. The renewable energy industry has seen many new companies launched, huge increases in company valuations and numerous initial public offerings. The 140 highest-valued publicly traded renewable energy companies now have a combined market capitalisation of over $100 billion.

futu[r]e investment | GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW

Major industrial growth is occurring in a number of emerging renewable technologies, including thin-film solar PV, concentrating

7

solar thermal power generation and advanced or second generation

bio fuels. Worldwide employment in renewable energy

manufacturing, operation and maintenance exceeded 2.4 million

jobs in 2006, including some 1.1 million in bio fuels production.

The main reason for this industrial expansion is that national targets for renewable energy have been adopted in at least 66 countries worldwide, including all 27 European Union member states, 29 US states and nine Canadian provinces. Most targets are for a percentage of electricity production or primary energy to be achieved by a specific future year. There is now an EU-wide target, for example, for 20 % of energy to come from renewables by 2020 and a Chinese target of 15 %. Targets for bio fuel use in transport energy also now exist in several countries, including an EU-wide target for 10 % by 2020.

Specific policies to promote renewables have also mushroomed in recent years. At least 60 countries - 37 developed and transition countries and 23 developing countries - have adopted some type of policy to promote renewable power generation. The most common is the feed-in law, through which a set premium price is paid for each unit of renewable power generation. By 2007, at least 37 countries and nine states or provinces had adopted feed-in policies, more than half of which have been enacted since 2002. At least 44 states, provinces and countries have enacted renewable portfolio standards (RPS), which place an obligation on energy companies to source a rising percentage of their power from renewable sources. Other forms of support for renewable power generation include capital investment subsidies or rebates, tax incentives and credits, sales tax and value-added tax exemptions, net metering, public investment or financing and public competitive bidding.

Beneath a national and state level, municipalities around the world are also setting targets for future shares of renewable energy, typically in the range of 10­20 %. Some cities have established carbon dioxide reduction targets, others are enacting policies to promote solar hot water and solar PV or introducing urban planning rules which incorporate renewable energy. Market facilitation organisations are supporting the growth of renewable energy markets and policies through networking, market research, training, project facilitation, consulting, financing, policy advice and other technical assistance. There are now hundreds of such organisations around the world, including industry associations, non-governmental organisations, multilateral and bilateral development agencies, international partnerships and government agencies.

growth rates of the renewable energy industry
Figure 7.2 shows that many renewable energy technologies grew at rates of 15­30 % annually during the five year period 2002­2006, including wind power, solar hot water, geothermal heating and offgrid solar PV. Grid-connected solar PV eclipsed all of these, with a 60 % annual average growth rate for the period. Bio fuels also grew rapidly during the period, at a 40 % annual average for biodiesel and 15 % for ethanol. Other technologies are growing more slowly, at 3­5 %, including large hydropower, biomass power and heat, and geothermal power, although in some countries these technologies are growing much more rapidly than the global average.
These expansion rates compare with the global growth rates for fossil fuels of 2­4 % in recent years (higher in some developing countries)35.

future growth rates
In order to get a better understanding of what different technologies can deliver, however, it is necessary to examine more closely how future production capacities can be achieved from the current baseline. The wind industry, for example, has a current annual production capacity of about 25,000 MW. If this output were not expanded, total capacity would reach 650 GW by the year 2050. This includes the need for ""repowering"" of older wind turbines after 20 years. But according to this scenario the share of wind electricity in global production by 2050 would need to grow from today's 1% to 4.5% under the Reference Scenario and 6.5% under the Energy [R]evolution pathway.

A relatively modest expansion from today's 25 GW production capacity, however, to about 80 GW by 2020 and 100 GW in 2040 would lead to a total installed capacity of 1,800 GW in 2050, providing between 12% and 18% of world electricity demand.

The tables below provide an overview of current generation levels,

the capacities required under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario and

industry projections of a more advanced market growth. The good

news is that the scenario does not even come close to the limit of

the renewable industries' own projections. However, the scenario

assumes that at the same time strong energy efficiency measures

are taken in order to save resources and develop a more cost

optimised energy supply.

futu[r]e investment | FUTURE GROWTH RATES
investment in new power plants
The overall global level of investment required in new power plants up to 2030 will be in the region of $ 11 to 14 trillion. The main driver for investment in new generation capacity in OECD countries will be the ageing power plant fleet. Utilities will make their technology choices within the next five to ten years based on national energy policies, in particular market liberalisation, renewable energy and CO2 reduction targets. Within Europe, the EU emissions trading scheme may have a major impact on whether the majority of investment goes into fossil fuel power plants or renewable energy and
7 co-generation. In developing countries, international financial
institutions will play a major role in future technology choices.
The investment volume required to realise the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is $ 14.7 trillion, approximately 30% higher than in the Reference Scenario, which will require $ 11.3 trillion. Whilst the levels of investment in renewable energy and fossil fuels are almost equal under the Reference Scenario, with about $ 4.5 trillion each up to 2030, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario shifts about 80% of investment towards renewable energy. The fossil fuel share of power sector investment is focused mainly on combined heat and power and efficient gas-fired power plants.
The average annual investment in the power sector under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario between 2005 and 2030 is approximately $ 590 billion. This is equal to the current amount of subsidies for fossil fuels globally in less than two years. Most investment in new power generation will take place in China, followed by North America and Europe. South Asia, including India, and East Asia, including Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, will also be `hot spots' of new power generation investment.

renewable power generation investment
Under the Reference Scenario the investment expected in renewable electricity generation will be $ 4.7 trillion. This compares with $ 8.9 trillion in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The regional distribution in the two scenarios, however, is almost the same.
How investment is divided between the different renewable power generation technologies depends on their level of technical development. Technologies like wind power, which in some regions with good wind resources is already cost competitive with conventional fuels, will take a larger investment volume and a bigger market share. The market volume by technology and region also depends on the local resources and policy framework.
For solar photovoltaics, the main market will remain for some years in Europe and the US, but will soon expand across China and India. Because solar PV is a highly modular and decentralised technology which can be used almost everywhere, its market will eventually be spread across the entire world.

Concentrated solar power systems, on the other hand, can only be operated within the world's sunbelt regions. The main investment in this technology will therefore take place in North Africa, the Middle East, parts of the USA and Mexico, as well as south-west China, India, Australia and southern Europe.
The main development of the wind industry will take place in Europe, North America and China. Offshore wind technology will take a larger share from roughly 2015 onwards. The main offshore wind development will take place in North Europe and North America.
The market for geothermal power plants will be mainly in North America and East Asia. The USA, Indonesia and the Philippines, and some countries of central and southern Africa, have the highest potential over the next 20 years. After 2030, geothermal generation will expand to other parts of the world, including Europe and India.
Bio energy power plants will be distributed across the whole world as there is potential almost everywhere for biomass and/or biogas (cogeneration) power plants.

fossil fuel power generation investment

Under the Reference Scenario, the main market expansion for new fossil fuel power plants will be in China, followed by North America, which will have a volume equal to India and Europe combined. In the Energy [R]evolution Scenario the overall investment in fossil fuel power stations up to 2030 will be $ 2,600 billion, significantly lower than the Reference Scenario's $ 4,500 billion.

China will be by far the largest investor in coal power plants in both

scenarios. While in the Reference Scenario the growth trend of the

7

current decade (2000­2010) will continue towards 2030, the Energy [R]evolution Scenario assumes that in the second and third

decades (2011-2030) growth slows down significantly. In the

Reference Scenario the massive expansion of coal firing is due to

activity in China, followed by the USA, India, East Asia and Europe.

The total cost for fossil fuel investment in the Reference Scenario between 2005 and 2030 amounts to $ 80.6 trillion, compared to $ 61.8 trillion in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario.This means that fuel costs in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are already about 25% lower by 2030 and will be

50% lower by 2050. Although the investment in gas-fired power stations and cogeneration plants is about the same in both scenarios, the finance committed to oil and coal for electricity generation in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is almost 30% below the Reference version.
fuel cost savings with renewables
Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the total fuel cost savings in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario reach a total of $18.7 trillion, or $ 750 billion per year. A comparison between the extra fuel costs associated with the Reference Scenario and the extra investment costs of the Energy [R]evolution version shows that the average annual additional fuel costs are about five times higher than the additional investment requirements of the alternative scenario. In fact, the additional costs for coal fuel from today until the year 2030 are as high as $ 15.9 trillion: this would cover the entire investment in renewable and cogeneration capacity required to implement the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. These renewable energy sources will produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond 2030, while the costs for coal and gas will continue to be a burden on national economies.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

energy resources & security of supply | OIL - RESERVES CHAOS

The issue of security of supply is now at the top of the energy policy agenda. Concern is focused both on price security and the security of physical supply. At present around 80% of global energy demand is met by fossil fuels. The unrelenting increase in energy demand is matched by the finite nature of these sources. The regional distribution of oil and gas resources, on the other hand, does not match the distribution of demand. Some countries have to rely almost entirely on fossil fuel imports. The maps on the following pages provide an overview of the availability of different fuels and their regional distribution. Information in this chapter is based partly on the report `Plugging the Gap'36.
oil
8
Oil is the lifeblood of the modern global economy, as the effects of the supply disruptions of the 1970s made clear. It is the number one source of energy, providing 36% of the world's needs and the fuel employed almost exclusively for essential uses such as transportation. However, a passionate debate has developed over the ability of supply to meet increasing consumption, a debate obscured by poor information and stirred by recent soaring prices.

the reserves chaos
Public data about oil and gas reserves is strikingly inconsistent, and potentially unreliable for legal, commercial, historical and sometimes political reasons. The most widely available and quoted figures, those from the industry journals Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil, have limited value as they report the reserve figures provided by companies and governments without analysis or verification. Moreover, as there is no agreed definition of reserves or standard reporting practice, these figures usually stand for different physical and conceptual magnitudes. Confusing terminology (`proved', `probable', `possible', `recoverable', `reasonable certainty') only adds to the problem.
Historically, private oil companies have consistently underestimated their reserves to comply with conservative stock exchange rules and through natural commercial caution. Whenever a discovery was made, only a portion of the geologist's estimate of recoverable resources was reported; subsequent revisions would then increase the reserves from that same oil field over time. National oil companies, mostly represented by OPEC (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries), are not subject to any sort of accountability, so their reporting practices are even less clear. In the late 1980s, OPEC countries blatantly overstated their reserves while competing for production quotas, which were allocated as a proportion of the reserves. Although some revision was needed after the companies were nationalised, between 1985 and 1990, OPEC countries increased their joint reserves by 82%. Not only were these dubious revisions never corrected, but many of these countries have reported untouched reserves for years, even if no sizeable discoveries were made and production continued at the same pace. Additionally, the Former Soviet Union's oil and gas reserves have been overestimated by about 30% because the original assessments were later misinterpreted.
Whilst private companies are now becoming more realistic about the extent of their resources, the OPEC countries hold by far the majority of the reported reserves, and information on their resources is as unsatisfactory as ever. In brief, these information sources should be treated with considerable caution. To fairly estimate the world's oil resources a regional assessment of the mean backdated (i.e. `technical') discoveries would need to be performed.

gas
Natural gas has been the fastest growing fossil energy source in the last two decades, boosted by its increasing share in the electricity generation mix. Gas is generally regarded as an abundant resource and public concerns about depletion are limited to oil, even though few in-depth studies address the subject. Gas resources are more concentrated, and a few massive fields make up most of the reserves: the largest gas field in the world holds 15% of the `Ultimate Recoverable Resources' (URR), compared to 6% for oil. Unfortunately, information about gas resources suffers from the same bad practices as oil data because gas mostly comes from the same geological formations, and the same stakeholders are involved.
Most reserves are initially understated and then gradually revised upwards, giving an optimistic impression of growth. By contrast, Russia's reserves, the largest in the world, are considered to have been overestimated by about 30%. Owing to geological similarities, gas follows the same depletion dynamic as oil, and thus the same discovery and production cycles. In fact, existing data for gas is of worse quality than for oil, with ambiguities arising over the amount produced partly because flared and vented gas is not always accounted for. As opposed to published reserves, the technical ones have been almost constant since 1980 because discoveries have roughly matched production.

coal

Coal was the world's largest source of primary energy until it was overtaken by oil in the 1960s. Today, coal supplies almost one quarter of the world's energy. Despite being the most abundant of fossil fuels, coal's development is currently threatened by environmental concerns; hence its future will unfold in the context of both energy security and global warming.

Coal is abundant and more equally distributed throughout the world

than oil and gas. Global recoverable reserves are the largest of all

fossil fuels, and most countries have at least some. Moreover, existing

and prospective big energy consumers like the US, China and India

are self-sufficient in coal and will be for the foreseeable future. Coal

has been exploited on a large scale for two centuries, so both the

8

product and the available resources are well known; no substantial

new deposits are expected to be discovered. Extrapolating the

demand forecast forward, the world will consume 20% of its current

reserves by 2030 and 40% by 2050. Hence, if current trends are

maintained, coal would still last several hundred years.

energy resources & security of supply | GAS - COAL
nuclear
Uranium, the fuel used in nuclear power plants, is a finite resource whose economically available reserves are limited. Its distribution is almost as concentrated as oil and does not match regional consumption. Five countries - Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, Russia and Niger - control three quarters of the world's supply. As a significant user of uranium, however, Russia's reserves will be exhausted within ten years.
Secondary sources, such as old deposits, currently make up nearly half of worldwide uranium reserves. However, those will soon be used up. Mining capacities will have to be nearly doubled in the next few years to meet current needs.

A joint report by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency37 and the International Atomic Energy Agency estimates that all existing nuclear power plants will have used up their nuclear fuel, employing current technology, within less than 70 years. Given the range of scenarios for the worldwide development of nuclear power, it is likely that uranium supplies will be exhausted sometime between 2026 and 2070. This forecast includes the use of mixed oxide fuel (MOX), a mixture of uranium and plutonium.

and future predictions for

the E[R] scenario.

renewable energy
Nature offers a variety of freely available options for producing energy. Their exploitation is mainly a question of how to convert sunlight, wind, biomass or water into electricity, heat or power as efficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively as possible.
On average, the energy in the sunshine that reaches the Earth is about one kilowatt per square metre worldwide. According to the Research Association for Solar Power, power is gushing from renewable energy sources at a rate of 2,850 times more energy than is needed in the world. In one day, the sunlight which reaches the Earth produces enough energy to satisfy the world's current power requirements for eight years. Even though only a percentage of that
8 potential is technically accessible, this is still enough to provide just
under six times more power than the world currently requires.

definition of types of energy resource potential38
theoretical potential The theoretical potential identifies the physical upper limit of the energy available from a certain source. For solar energy, for example, this would be the total solar radiation falling on a particular surface.
conversion potential This is derived from the annual efficiency of the respective conversion technology. It is therefore not a strictly defined value, since the efficiency of a particular technology depends on technological progress.
technical potential This takes into account additional restrictions regarding the area that is realistically available for energy generation. Technological, structural and ecological restrictions, as well as legislative requirements, are accounted for.
economic potential The proportion of the technical potential that can be utilised economically. For biomass, for example, those quantities are included that can be exploited economically in competition with other products and land uses.
sustainable potential This limits the potential of an energy source based on evaluation of ecological and socio-economic factors.

energy resources & security of supply | RENEWABLE ENERGY

renewable energy potential by region and technology
Based on the report `Renewable Energy Potentials' from REN 21, a global policy network39, we can provide a more detailed overview of renewable energy prospects by world region and technology. The table below focuses on large economies, which consume 80 % of the world's primary energy and produce a similar share of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology can be harnessed almost everywhere, and its technical potential is estimated at over 1,500 EJ/year, closely followed by concentrating solar thermal power (CSP). These two cannot simply be added together, however, because they would require much of the same land resources. The onshore wind potential is equally vast, with almost 400 EJ/year available beyond the order of magnitude of future electricity consumption. The estimate for offshore wind potential (22 EJ/year) is cautious, as only wind intensive areas on ocean shelf areas, with a relatively shallow water depth, and outside shipping lines and

protected areas, are included. The various ocean or marine energy potentials also reach a similar magnitude, most of it from ocean waves. Cautious estimates reach a figure of around 50 EJ/year. The estimates for hydro and geothermal resources are well established, each having a technical potential of around 50 EJ/year. Those figures should be seen in the context of a current global energy demand of around 500 EJ.
In terms of heating and cooling, apart from using biomass, there is the option of using direct geothermal energy. The potential is extremely large and could cover 20 times the current world energy demand for heat. The potential for solar heating, including passive solar building design, is virtually limitless. However, heat is costly to transport and one should only consider geothermal heat and solar
water heating potentials which are sufficiently close to the point of 8
consumption. Passive solar technology, which contributes enormously to the provision of heating services, is not considered as a (renewable energy) supply source in this analysis but as an efficiency factor to be taken into account in the demand forecasts.
the global potential for sustainable biomass
As part of background research for the Energy [R]evolution Scenario, Greenpeace commissioned the German Biomass Research Centre, the former Institute for Energy and Environment, to investigate the worldwide potential for energy crops in different scenarios up to 2050. In addition, information has been compiled from scientific studies of the worldwide potential and from data derived from state of the art remote sensing techniques such as satellite images. A summary of the report's findings is given below; references can be found in the full report.
assessment of biomass potential studies
8 Various studies have looked historically at the potential for bio
energy and come up with widely differing results. Comparison between them is difficult because they use different definitions of the various biomass resource fractions. This problem is particularly significant in relation to forest derived biomass. Most research has focused almost exclusively on energy crops, as their development is considered to be more significant for satisfying the demand for bio energy. The result is that the potential for using forest residues (wood left over after harvesting) is often underestimated.
Data from 18 studies has been examined, with a concentration on those studies which report the potential for biomass residues. Among these there were ten comprehensive assessments with more or less detailed documentation of the methodology. The majority focus on the long-term potential for 2050 and 2100. Little information is available for 2020 and 2030. Most of the studies were published within the last ten years. Figure 8.2 shows the variations in potential by biomass type from the different studies.
figure 8.2: ranges of potentials for different resource categories

Looking at the contribution of individual resources to the total biomass potential, the majority of studies agree that the most promising resource is energy crops from dedicated plantations. Only six give a regional breakdown, however, and only a few quantify all types of residues separately. Quantifying the potential of minor fractions, such as animal residues and organic wastes, is difficult as the data is relatively poor.


potential of energy crops
Apart from the utilisation of biomass from residues, the cultivation of energy crops in agricultural production systems is of greatest significance. The technical potential for growing energy crops has been calculated on the assumption that demand for food takes priority. As a first step the demand for arable and grassland for food production has been calculated for each of 133 countries in different scenarios. These scenarios are:
· Business as usual (BAU) scenario: Present agricultural activity continues for the foreseeable future
· Basic scenario: No forest clearing; reduced use of fallow areas for agriculture
· Sub-scenario 1: Basic scenario plus expanded ecological protection areas and reduced crop yields
· Sub-scenario 2: Basic scenario plus food consumption reduced in industrialised countries
· Sub-scenario 3: Combination of sub-scenarios 1 and 2

In a next step the surpluses of agricultural areas were classified either as arable land or grassland. On grassland, hay and grass silage are produced, on arable land fodder silage and Short Rotation Coppice (such as fast-growing willow or poplar) are cultivated. Silage of green fodder and grass are assumed to be used for biogas production, wood from SRC and hay from grasslands for the production of heat, electricity and synthetic fuels. Country specific yield variations were taken into consideration.
The result is that the global biomass potential from energy crops in 2050 falls within a range from 6 EJ in Sub-scenario 1 up to 97 EJ in the BAU scenario.
The best example of a country which would see a very different future
under these scenarios in 2050 is Brazil. Under the BAU scenario large 8
agricultural areas would be released by deforestation, whereas in the Basic and Sub 1 scenarios this would be forbidden, and no agricultural areas would be available for energy crops. By contrast a high potential would be available under Sub-scenario 2 as a consequence of reduced meat consumption. Because of their high populations and relatively small agricultural areas, no surplus land is available for energy crop production in Central America, Asia and Africa. The EU, North America and Australia, however, have relatively stable potentials.

The results of this exercise show that the availability of biomass resources is not only driven by the effect on global food supply but the conservation of natural forests and other biospheres. So the assessment of future biomass potential is only the starting point of a discussion about the integration of bioenergy into a renewable energy system.

The total global biomass potential (energy crops and residues) therefore ranges in 2020 from 66 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) up to 110 EJ (Sub-scenario 2) and in 2050 from 94 EJ (Sub-scenario 1) to 184 EJ (BAU scenario). These numbers are conservative and include a level of uncertainty, especially for 2050. The reasons for this uncertainty are the potential effects of climate change, possible changes in the worldwide political and economic situation, a higher yield as a result of changed agricultural techniques and/or faster development in plant breeding.
This chapter describes the range of technologies available now and in the future to satisfy the world's energy demand. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario is focused on the potential for energy savings and renewable sources, primarily in the electricity and heat generating sectors. Although fuel use in transport is accounted for in the scenarios of future energy supply, no detailed description is given here of fuel sources, such as bio fuels for vehicles, which offer an alternative to the currently predominant oil.
fossil fuel technologies
The most commonly used fossil fuels for power generation around the world are coal and gas. Oil is still used where other fuels are not readily available, for example islands or remote sites, or where there is an indigenous resource. Together, coal and gas currently account for over half of global electricity supply.
coal combustion technologies In a conventional coal-fired power station, pulverised or powdered coal is blown into a combustion chamber where it is burnt at high temperature. The hot gases and heat produced converts water flowing through pipes lining the boiler into steam. This drives a steam turbine and generates electricity. Over 90% of global coal-fired capacity uses this system. Coal power stations can vary in capacity from a few hundred megawatts up to several thousand.
A number of technologies have been introduced to improve the environmental performance of conventional coal combustion. These include coal cleaning (to reduce the ash content) and various `bolton' or `end-of-pipe' technologies to reduce emissions of particulates, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, the main pollutants resulting from coal firing apart from carbon dioxide. Flue gas desulphurisation (FGD), for example, most commonly involves `scrubbing' the flue gases using an alkaline sorbent slurry, which is predominantly lime or limestone based.

More fundamental changes have been made to the way coal is burned to both improve its efficiency and further reduce emissions of pollutants. These include:

· Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle: Coal is not burnt directly but reacted with oxygen and steam to form a synthetic gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. This is cleaned and then burned in a gas turbine to generate electricity and produce steam to drive a steam turbine. IGCC improves the efficiency of coal combustion from 38-40% up to 50%.

· Supercritical and Ultrasupercritical: These power plants operate at higher temperatures than conventional combustion, again increasing efficiency towards 50%.

· Fluidised Bed Combustion: Coal is burned in a reactor

comprised of a bed through which gas is fed to keep the fuel in

a turbulent state. This improves combustion, heat transfer and the

recovery of waste products. By elevating pressures within a bed,

a high-pressure gas stream can be used to drive a gas turbine,

9

generating electricity. Emissions of both sulphur dioxide and

nitrogen oxide can be reduced substantially.

energy technologies | FOSSIL FUEL

· Pressurised Pulverised Coal Combustion: Mainly being developed in Germany, this is based on the combustion of a finely ground cloud of coal particles creating high pressure, high temperature steam for power generation. The hot flue gases are used to generate electricity in a similar way to the combined cycle system.

Other potential future technologies involve the increased use of coal gasification. Underground Coal Gasification, for example, involves converting deep underground unworked coal into a combustible gas which can be used for industrial heating, power generation or the manufacture of hydrogen, synthetic natural gas or other chemicals. The gas can be processed to remove CO2 before it is passed on to end users. Demonstration projects are underway in Australia, Europe, China and Japan.

gas combustion technologies Natural gas can be used for electricity generation through the use of either gas turbines or steam turbines. For the equivalent amount of heat, gas produces about 45% less carbon dioxide during its combustion than coal.

Gas turbine plants use the heat from gases to directly operate the turbine. Natural gas fuelled turbines can start rapidly, and are therefore often used to supply energy during periods of peak demand, although at higher cost than baseload plants.

Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. In a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, a gas turbine generator produces electricity and the exhaust gases from the turbine are then used to make steam to generate additional electricity. The efficiency of modern CCGT power stations can be more than 50%. Most new gas power plants built since the 1990s have been of this type.

At least until the recent increase in global gas prices, CCGT power stations have been the cheapest option for electricity generation in many countries. Capital costs have been substantially lower than for coal and nuclear plants and construction time shorter.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

energy technologies | FOSSIL FUEL

carbon reduction technologies Whenever coal or gas is burned, carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced. Depending on the type of power plant, a large quantity of the gas will dissipate into the atmosphere and contribute to climate change. A hard coal power plant discharges roughly 720 grammes of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour, a modern gas-fired plant about 370g CO2/kWh. To ensure that no CO2 emerges from the power plant chimney, the gas must first be removed, and then stored somewhere. Both carbon capture and storage (CCS) have limitations. Even after employing proposed capture technologies, a residual amount of carbon dioxide - between 60 and 150g CO2/kWh - will continue to be emitted.
carbon dioxide storage CO2 captured at the point of incineration has to be stored somewhere. Current thinking is that it can be trapped in the oceans or under the Earth's surface at a depth of over 3,000 feet. As with nuclear waste, however, the question is whether this will just displace the problem elsewhere.
9
Ocean storage could result in greatly accelerated acidification of large sea areas and would be detrimental to a great many organisms, if not entire ecosystems, in the vicinity of injection sites. CO2 disposed of in this way is likely to get back into the atmosphere in a relatively short time. The oceans are both productive resources and a common natural endowment for this and future generations. Given the diversity of other options available for dealing with CO2 emissions, direct disposal to the ocean, sea floor, lakes and other open reservoir structures must be ruled out.
Among the options available for underground storage, empty oil and gas fields are riddled with holes drilled during their exploration and production phases. These holes have to be sealed over. Normally special cement is used, but carbon dioxide is relatively reactive with water and attacks metals or cement, so that even sealed drilling holes present a safety hazard. To many experts the question is not if but when leakages will occur.
Because of the lack of experience with CO2 storage, its safety is often compared to the storage of natural gas. This technology has been tried and tested for decades and is considered by industry to be low risk. Greenpeace does not share this assessment. A number of serious leaks from gas storage installations have occurred around the world, sometimes requiring evacuation of nearby residents.
Sudden leakage of CO2 can be fatal. Carbon dioxide is not itself poisonous, and is contained (approx. 0.04 per cent) in the air we breathe. But as concentrations increase it displaces the vital oxygen in the air. Air with concentrations of 7 to 8% CO2 by volume causes death by suffocation after 30 to 60 minutes.
There are also health hazards when large amounts of CO2 are explosively released. Although the gas normally disperses quickly after leaking, it can accumulate in depressions in the landscape or closed buildings, since carbon dioxide is heavier than air. It is equally dangerous when it escapes more slowly and without being noticed in residential areas, for example in cellars below houses.
The dangers from such leaks are known from natural volcanic CO2 degassing. Gas escaping at the Lake Nyos crater lake in Cameroon, Africa in 1986 killed over 1,700 people. At least ten people have died in the Lazio region of Italy in the last 20 years as a result of CO2 being released.
134

carbon storage and climate change targets Can carbon storage contribute to climate change reduction targets? In order to avoid dangerous climate change, we need to reduce CO2 globally by 50% in 2050. Power plants that store CO2 are still being developed, however, and could only become reality in 15 years at the earliest. This means they will not make any substantial contribution towards protecting the climate until the year 2020 at the earliest. They are thus irrelevant to the goals of the Kyoto Protocol.
Nor is CO2 storage of any great help in attaining the goal of an 80% reduction by 2050 in OECD countries. If it does become available in 2020, most of the world's new power plants will have just finished being modernised. All that could then be done would be for existing power plants to be retrofitted and CO2 captured from the waste gas flow. As retrofitting existing power plants is highly expensive, a high carbon price would be needed.
Employing CO2 capture will also increase the price of electricity from fossil fuels. Although the costs of storage depend on many factors, including the technology used for separation, transport and the storage installation, experts from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculate the additional costs at between 3.5 and 5.0 cents/kWh of power. Since modern wind turbines in good wind locations are already cost competitive with new build coal-fired power plants today, the costs will probably be at the top end. This means the technology would more than double the cost of electricity.
The conclusion reached in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario is that renewable energy sources are already available, in many cases cheaper, and without the negative environmental impacts that are associated with fossil fuel exploitation, transport and processing. It is renewable energy together with energy efficiency and energy conservation ­ and not carbon capture and storage ­ that has to increase worldwide so that the primary cause of climate change ­ the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas ­ is stopped.
Greenpeace opposes any CCS efforts which lead to:
· The undermining or threats to undermine existing global and regional regulations governing the disposal of wastes at sea (in the water column, at or beneath the seabed).
· Continued or increasing finance to the fossil fuel sector at the expense of renewable energy and energy efficiency.
· The stagnation of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy conservation improvements.
· The promotion of this possible future technology as the only major solution to climate change, thereby leading to new fossil fuel developments ­ especially lignite and black coal-fired power plants, and an increase in emissions in the short to medium term.

nuclear technologies
Generating electricity from nuclear power involves transferring the heat produced by a controlled nuclear fission reaction into a conventional steam turbine generator. The nuclear reaction takes place inside a core and surrounded by a containment vessel of varying design and structure. Heat is removed from the core by a coolant (gas or water) and the reaction controlled by a moderating element or ""moderator"".
Across the world over the last two decades there has been a general slowdown in building new nuclear power stations. This has been caused by a variety of factors: fear of a nuclear accident, following the events at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Monju, increased scrutiny of economics and environmental factors, such as waste management and radioactive discharges.
nuclear reactor designs: evolution and safety issues At the beginning of 2005 there were 441 nuclear power reactors operating in 31 countries around the world. Although there are dozens of different reactor designs and sizes, there are three broad categories either currently deployed or under development. These are:
Generation I: Prototype commercial reactors developed in the 1950s and 1960s as modified or enlarged military reactors, originally either for submarine propulsion or plutonium production.
Generation II: Mainstream reactor designs in commercial operation worldwide.
Generation III: New generation reactors now being built.
Generation III reactors include the so-called Advanced Reactors, three of which are already in operation in Japan, with more under construction or planned. About 20 different designs are reported to be under development40, most of them `evolutionary' designs developed from Generation II reactor types with some modifications, but without introducing drastic changes. Some of them represent more innovative approaches. According to the World Nuclear Association, reactors of Generation III are characterised by the following:
· A standardised design for each type to expedite licensing, reduce capital cost and construction time.
· A simpler and more rugged design, making them easier to operate and less vulnerable to operational upsets.
· Higher availability and longer operating life, typically 60 years.
· Reduced possibility of core melt accidents.
· Minimal effect on the environment.
· Higher burn-up to reduce fuel use and the amount of waste.
· Burnable absorbers (`poisons') to extend fuel life.

To what extent these goals address issues of higher safety standards, as opposed to improved economics, remains unclear.

Of the new reactor types, the European Pressurised Water Reactor (EPR) has been developed from the most recent Generation II designs to start operation in France and Germany41. Its stated goals are to improve safety levels - in particular, reduce the probability of a severe accident by a factor of ten, achieve mitigation of severe accidents by restricting their consequences to the plant itself, and reduce costs. Compared to its predecessors, however, the EPR displays several modifications which constitute a reduction of safety margins, including:

· The volume of the reactor building has been reduced by simplifying the layout of the emergency core cooling system, and by using the results of new calculations which predict less hydrogen development during an accident.

· The thermal output of the plant has been increased by 15%

9

relative to existing French reactors by increasing core outlet

temperature, letting the main coolant pumps run at higher

capacity and modifying the steam generators.

energy technologies | NUCLEAR

· The EPR has fewer redundant pathways in its safety systems than a German Generation II reactor.

Several other modifications are hailed as substantial safety improvements, including a `core catcher' system to control a meltdown accident. Nonetheless, in spite of the changes being envisaged, there is no guarantee that the safety level of the EPR actually represents a significant improvement. In particular, reduction of the expected core melt probability by a factor of ten is not proven. Furthermore, there are serious doubts as to whether the mitigation and control of a core melt accident with the core catcher concept will actually work.

Finally, Generation IV reactors are currently being developed with the aim of commercialisation in 20-30 years.

renewable energy technologies
Renewable energy covers a range of natural sources which are constantly renewed and therefore, unlike fossil fuels and uranium, will never be exhausted. Most of them derive from the effect of the sun and moon on the Earth's weather patterns. They also produce none of the harmful emissions and pollution associated with `conventional' fuels. Although hydroelectric power has been used on an industrial scale since the middle of the last century, the serious exploitation of other renewable sources has a more recent history.
solar power (photovoltaics pv) There is more than enough solar radiation available all over the world to satisfy a vastly increased demand for solar power systems. The sunlight which reaches the Earth's surface is enough to provide 2,850 times as much energy as we can currently use. On a global average, each square metre of land is exposed to enough sunlight to produce 1,700 kWh of power every
9 year.The average irradiation in Europe is about 1,000 kWh per square
metre, however, compared with 1,800 kWh in the Middle East.
Photovoltaic (PV) technology involves the generation of electricity from light. The secret to this process is the use of a semiconductor material which can be adapted to release electrons, the negatively charged particles that form the basis of electricity. The most common semiconductor material used in photovoltaic cells is silicon, an element most commonly found in sand. All PV cells have at least two layers of such semiconductors, one positively charged and one negatively charged. When light shines on the semiconductor, the electric field across the junction between these two layers causes electricity to flow. The greater the intensity of the light, the greater the flow of electricity. A photovoltaic system does not therefore need bright sunlight in order to operate, and can generate electricity even on cloudy days. Solar PV is different from a solar thermal collecting system (see below) where the sun's rays are used to generate heat, usually for hot water in a house, swimming pool etc.
The most important parts of a PV system are the cells which form the basic building blocks, the modules which bring together large numbers of cells into a unit, and, in some situations, the inverters used to convert the electricity generated into a form suitable for everyday use. When a PV installation is described as having a capacity of 3 kWp (peak), this refers to the output of the system under standard testing conditions, allowing comparison between different modules. In central Europe a 3 kWp rated solar electricity system, with a surface area of approximately 27 square metres, would produce enough power to meet the electricity demand of an energy conscious household.

types of PV system
· grid connected The most popular type of solar PV system for homes and businesses in the developed world. Connection to the local electricity network allows any excess power produced to be sold to the utility. Electricity is then imported from the network outside daylight hours. An inverter is used to convert the DC power produced by the system to AC power for running normal electrical equipment.
· grid support A system can be connected to the local electricity network as well as a back-up battery. Any excess solar electricity produced after the battery has been charged is then sold to the network. This system is ideal for use in areas of unreliable power supply.
· off-grid Completely independent of the grid, the system is connected to a battery via a charge controller, which stores the electricity generated and acts as the main power supply. An inverter can be used to provide AC power, enabling the use of normal appliances. Typical off-grid applications are repeater stations for mobile phones or rural electrification. Rural electrification means either small solar home systems covering basic electricity needs or solar mini grids, which are larger solar electricity systems providing electricity for several households.
· hybrid system A solar system can be combined with another source of power - a biomass generator, a wind turbine or diesel generator - to ensure a consistent supply of electricity. A hybrid system can be grid connected, stand alone or grid support.

concentrating solar power (CSP) Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants, also called solar thermal power plants, produce electricity in much the same way as conventional power stations. The difference is that they obtain their energy input by concentrating solar radiation and converting it to high temperature steam or gas to drive a turbine or motor engine. Large mirrors concentrate sunlight into a single line or point. The heat created there is used to generate steam. This hot, highly pressurised steam is used to power turbines which generate electricity. In sun-drenched regions, CSP plants can guarantee a large proportion of electricity production.
Four main elements are required: a concentrator, a receiver, some form of transfer medium or storage, and power conversion. Many different types of system are possible, including combinations with other renewable and non-renewable technologies, but the three most promising solar thermal technologies are:
· parabolic trough Trough-shaped mirror reflectors are used to concentrate sunlight on to thermally efficient receiver tubes placed in the trough's focal line. A thermal transfer fluid, such as synthetic thermal oil, is circulated in these tubes. Heated to approximately 400°C by the concentrated sun's rays, this oil is then pumped through a series of heat exchangers to produce superheated steam. The steam is converted to electrical energy in a conventional steam turbine generator, which can either be part of a conventional steam cycle or integrated into a combined steam and gas turbine cycle.
This is the most mature technology, with 354 MWe of plants connected to the Southern California grid since the 1980s and more than 2 million square metres of parabolic trough collectors installed worldwide.

· central receiver or solar tower A circular array of heliostats (large individually tracking mirrors) is used to concentrate sunlight on to a central receiver mounted at the top of a tower. A heattransfer medium absorbs the highly concentrated radiation reflected by the heliostats and converts it into thermal energy to be used for the subsequent generation of superheated steam for turbine operation. To date, the heat transfer media demonstrated include water/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium and air. If pressurised gas or air is used at very high temperatures of about 1,000°C or more as the heat transfer medium, it can even be used to directly replace natural gas in a gas turbine, thus making use of the excellent efficiency (60%+) of modern gas and steam combined cycles.

After an intermediate scaling up to 30 MW capacity, solar tower

developers now feel confident that grid-connected tower power

plants can be built up to a capacity of 200 MWe solar-only units.

Use of heat storage will increase their flexibility. Although solar

tower plants are considered to be further from commercialisation

than parabolic trough systems, they have good longer-term

9

prospects for high conversion efficiencies. Projects are being

developed in Spain, South Africa and Australia.

· parabolic dish A dish-shaped reflector is used to concentrate sunlight on to a receiver located at its focal point. The concentrated beam radiation is absorbed into the receiver to heat a fluid or gas to approximately 750°C. This is then used to generate electricity in a small piston, Stirling engine or a micro turbine, attached to the receiver.

The potential of parabolic dishes lies primarily for decentralised power supply and remote, stand-alone power systems. Projects are currently planned in the United States, Australia and Europe.

solar thermal collectors Solar thermal collecting systems are based on a centuries-old principle: the sun heats up water contained in a dark vessel. Solar thermal technologies on the market now are efficient and highly reliable, providing energy for a wide range of applications - from domestic hot water and space heating in residential and commercial buildings to swimming pool heating, solar-assisted cooling, industrial process heat and the desalination of drinking water.

solar domestic hot water and space heating Domestic hot water production is the most common application. Depending on the conditions and the system's configuration, most of a building's hot water requirements can be provided by solar energy. Larger systems can additionally cover a substantial part of the energy needed for space heating. There are two main types of technology:

· vacuum tubes The absorber inside the vacuum tube absorbs

radiation from the sun and heats up the fluid inside. Additional

9

radiation is picked up from the reflector behind the tubes. Whatever the angle of the sun, the round shape of the vacuum

tube allows it to reach the absorber. Even on a cloudy day, when

the light is coming from many angles at once, the vacuum tube

collector can still be effective.

energy technologies | RENEWABLE ENERGY

· flat panel This is basically a box with a glass cover which sits on the roof like a skylight. Inside is a series of copper tubes with copper fins attached. The entire structure is coated in a black substance designed to capture the sun's rays. These rays heat up a water and antifreeze mixture which circulates from the collector down to the building's boiler.

solar assisted cooling Solar chillers use thermal energy to produce cooling and/or dehumidify the air in a similar way to a refrigerator or conventional air-conditioning. This application is well-suited to solar thermal energy, as the demand for cooling is often greatest when there is most sunshine. Solar cooling has been successfully demonstrated and large-scale use can be expected in the future.

figure 9.3: flat panel solar technology

wind power Over the last 20 years, wind energy has become the world's fastest growing energy source. Today's wind turbines are produced by a sophisticated mass production industry employing a technology that is efficient, cost effective and quick to install. Turbine sizes range from a few kW to over 5,000 kW, with the largest turbines reaching more than 100m in height. One large wind turbine can produce enough electricity for about 5,000 households. State-of-the-art wind farms today can be as small as a few turbines and as large as several hundred MW.
The global wind resource is enormous, capable of generating more electricity than the world's total power demand, and well distributed across the five continents. Wind turbines can be operated not just in the windiest coastal areas but in countries which have no coastlines, including regions such as central Eastern Europe, central North and South America, and central Asia. The wind resource out at sea is even more productive than on land, encouraging the installation of offshore wind parks with foundations embedded in the ocean floor. In Denmark, a wind park built in 2002 uses 80 turbines to produce enough electricity for a city with a population of 150,000.
Smaller wind turbines can produce power efficiently in areas that otherwise have no access to electricity. This power can be used directly or stored in batteries. New technologies for using the wind's power are also being developed for exposed buildings in densely populated cities.
wind turbine design Significant consolidation of wind turbine design has taken place since the 1980s. The majority of commercial turbines now operate on a horizontal axis with three evenly spaced blades. These are attached to a rotor from which power is transferred through a gearbox to a generator. The gearbox and generator are contained within a housing called a nacelle. Some turbine designs avoid a gearbox by using direct drive. The electricity output is then channelled down the tower to a transformer and eventually into the local grid network.
Wind turbines can operate from a wind speed of 3-4 metres per second up to about 25 m/s. Limiting their power at high wind speeds is achieved either by `stall' regulation ­ reducing the power output ­ or `pitch' control ­ changing the angle of the blades so that they no longer offer any resistance to the wind. Pitch control has become the most common method. The blades can also turn at a constant or variable speed, with the latter enabling the turbine to follow more closely the changing wind speed.

The main design drivers for current wind technology are:
· high productivity at both low and high wind sites
· grid compatibility
· acoustic performance
· aerodynamic performance
· visual impact
· offshore expansion
Although the existing offshore market is only just over 1% of the world's land-based installed wind capacity, the latest developments in wind technology are primarily driven by this emerging potential. This means that the focus is on the most effective ways to make very large turbines.
Modern wind technology is available for a range of sites - low and high wind speeds, desert and arctic climates. European wind farms operate with high availability, are generally well integrated with the environment and accepted by the public. In spite of repeated predictions of a levelling off at an optimum mid-range size, and the fact that wind turbines cannot get larger indefinitely, turbine size has increased year on year from units of 20-60 kW in California in the 1980s up to the latest multi-MW machines with rotor diameters over 100 m. The average size of turbine installed around the world during 2007 was 1,492 kW, whilst the largest machine in operation is the Enercon E126, with a rotor diameter of 126 metres and a power capacity of 6 MW.
This growth in turbine size has been matched by the expansion of both markets and manufacturers. Almost 100,000 wind turbines now operate in over 50 countries around the world. The German market is the largest, but there has also been impressive growth in Spain, Denmark, India, China and the United States.

biomass energy Biomass is a broad term used to describe material of recent biological origin that can be used as a source of energy. This includes wood, crops, algae and other plants as well as agricultural and forest residues. Biomass can be used for a variety of end uses: heating, electricity generation or as fuel for transportation. The term `bio energy' is used for biomass energy systems that produce heat and/or electricity and `bio fuels' for liquid fuels used in transport. Biodiesel manufactured from various crops has become increasingly used as vehicle fuel, especially as the cost of oil has risen.
Biological power sources are renewable, easily stored, and, if sustainably harvested, CO2 neutral. This is because the gas emitted during their transfer into useful energy is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed when they were growing plants.
Electricity generating biomass power plants work just like natural
gas or coal power stations, except that the fuel must be processed 9
before it can be burned. These power plants are generally not as large as coal power stations because their fuel supply needs to grow as near as possible to the plant. Heat generation from biomass power plants can result either from utilising a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system, piping the heat to nearby homes or industry, or through dedicated heating systems. Small heating systems using specially produced pellets made from waste wood, for example, can be used to heat single family homes instead of natural gas or oil.

biomass technology A number of processes can be used to convert energy from biomass. These divide into thermal systems, which involve direct combustion of solids, liquids or a gas via pyrolysis or gasification, and biological systems, which involve decomposition of solid biomass to liquid or gaseous fuels by processes such as anaerobic digestion and fermentation.

· thermal systems

Direct combustion is the most common way of converting

biomass to energy, for heat as well as electricity. Worldwide it

accounts for over 90% of biomass generation. Technologies can

be distinguished as either fixed bed, fluidised bed or entrained

flow combustion. In fixed bed combustion, such as a grate

furnace, primary air passes through a fixed bed, in which drying,

gasification and charcoal combustion takes place. The

combustible gases produced are burned after the addition of

secondary air, usually in a zone separated from the fuel bed. In

9

fluidised bed combustion, the primary combustion air is injected from the bottom of the furnace with such high velocity that the

material inside the furnace becomes a seething mass of particles

and bubbles. Entrained flow combustion is suitable for fuels

available as small particles, such as sawdust or fine shavings,

which are pneumatically injected into the furnace.

energy technologies | RENEWABLE ENERGY

Gasification Biomass fuels are increasingly being used with advanced conversion technologies, such as gasification systems, which offer superior efficiencies compared with conventional power generation. Gasification is a thermochemical process in which biomass is heated with little or no oxygen present to produce a low energy gas. The gas can then be used to fuel a gas turbine or combustion engine to generate electricity. Gasification can also decrease emission levels compared to power production with direct combustion and a steam cycle.

Pyrolysis is a process whereby biomass is exposed to high temperatures in the absence of air, causing the biomass to decompose. The products of pyrolysis always include gas (`biogas'), liquid (`bio-oil') and solid (`char'), with the relative proportions of each depending on the fuel characteristics, the method of pyrolysis and the reaction parameters, such as temperature and pressure. Lower temperatures produce more solid and liquid products and higher temperatures more biogas.

· biological systems These processes are suitable for very wet biomass materials such as food or agricultural wastes, including farm animal slurry.

Anaerobic digestion means the breakdown of organic waste by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment. This produces a biogas typically made up of 65% methane and 35% carbon dioxide. Purified biogas can then be used both for heating and electricity generation.

Fermentation Fermentation is the process by which growing plants with a high sugar and starch content are broken down with the help of micro-organisms to produce ethanol and methanol. The end product is a combustible fuel that can be used in vehicles.


Biomass power station capacities typically range up to 15 MW, but larger plants are possible of up to 400 MW capacity, with part of the fuel input potentially being fossil fuel, for example pulverised coal. The world's largest biomass fuelled power plant is located at Pietarsaari in Finland. Built in 2001, this is an industrial CHP plant producing steam (100 MWth) and electricity (240 MWe) for the local forest industry and district heat for the nearby town. The boiler is a circulating fluidised bed boiler designed to generate steam from bark, sawdust, wood residues, commercial bio fuel and peat.
A 2005 study commissioned by Greenpeace Netherlands concluded that it was technically possible to build and operate a 1,000 MWe biomass fired power plant using fluidised bed combustion technology and fed with wood residue pellets42.
bio fuels Converting crops into ethanol and bio diesel made from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) currently takes place mainly in Brazil, the USA and Europe. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from `biogenic synthesis' gases will also play a larger role in the future. Theoretically bio fuels can be produced from any biological carbon source, although the most common are photosynthetic plants. Various plants and plant-derived materials are used for bio fuel production. Globally bio fuels are most commonly used to power vehicles, but can also be used for other purposes. The production and use of bio fuels must result in a net reduction in carbon emissions compared to the use of traditional fossil fuels to have a positive effect in climate change mitigation. Sustainable bio fuels can reduce the dependency on petroleum and thereby enhance energy security.
Bio ethanol is a fuel manufactured through the fermentation of sugars. This is done by accessing sugars directly (sugar cane or beet) or by breaking down starch in grains such as wheat, rye, barley or maize. In the European Union bio ethanol is mainly produced from grains, with wheat as the dominant feedstock. In Brazil the preferred feedstock is sugar cane, whereas in the USA it is corn (maize). Bio ethanol produced from cereals has a by-product, a protein-rich animal feed called Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles (DDGS). For every tonne of cereals used for ethanol production, on average one third will enter the animal feed stream as DDGS. Because of its high protein level this is currently used as a replacement for soy cake. Bio ethanol can either be blended into gasoline (petrol) directly or be used in the form of ETBE (Ethyl Tertiary Butyl Ether).
Bio diesel is a fuel produced from vegetable oil sourced from rapeseed, sunflower seeds or soybeans as well as used cooking oils or animal fats. Bio diesel comes in a standard form as `mono-alkyl ester' and other kinds of diesel-grade fuels of biological origin are not included. In specific cases, used vegetable oils can be recycled as feedstock for bio diesel production. This can reduce the loss of used oils in the environment and provides a new way of transforming a waste into transport energy. Blends of bio diesel and conventional hydrocarbonbased diesel are the most common products distributed in the retail transport fuel market.
Most countries use a labelling system to explain the proportion of bio diesel in any fuel mix. Fuel containing 20% biodiesel is labelled B20, while pure bio diesel is referred to as B100. Blends of 20 % bio diesel with 80 % petroleum diesel (B20) can generally be used in unmodified diesel engines. Used in its pure form (B100) an engine may require certain modifications. Bio diesel can also be used as a heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers. Older furnaces may contain rubber parts that would be affected by bio diesel's solvent properties, but can otherwise burn it without any conversion.


geothermal energy Geothermal energy is heat derived from deep underneath the Earth's crust. In most areas, this heat reaches the surface in a very diffuse state. However, due to a variety of geological processes, some areas, including the western part of the USA, west and central eastern Europe, Iceland, Asia and New Zealand are underlain by relatively shallow geothermal resources. These are classified as either low temperature (less than 90°C), moderate temperature (90° - 150°C) or high temperature (greater than 150°C). The uses to which these resources can be put depend on the temperature. The highest temperature is generally used only for electric power generation. Current global geothermal generation capacity totals approximately 8,000 MW. Uses for low and moderate temperature resources can be divided into two categories: direct use and ground-source heat pumps.
Geothermal power plants use the Earth's natural heat to vapourise water or an organic medium. The steam created then powers a turbine which produces electricity. In New Zealand and Iceland this technique has been used extensively for decades. In Germany, where it is necessary to drill many kilometres down to reach the necessary temperatures, it is only in the trial stages. Geothermal heat plants require lower temperatures and the heated water is used directly.

hydro power Water has been used to produce electricity for about a century. Today, around one fifth of the world's electricity is produced from hydro power. Large hydroelectric power plants with concrete dams and extensive collecting lakes often have very negative effects on the environment, however, requiring the flooding of habitable areas. Smaller `run-of-the-river' power stations, which are turbines powered by one section of running water in a river, can produce electricity in an environmentally friendly way.
The main requirement for hydro power is to create an artificial head so that water, diverted through an intake channel or pipe into a turbine, discharges back into the river downstream. Small hydro power is mainly `run-of-the-river' and does not collect significant amounts of stored water, requiring the construction of large dams and reservoirs. There are two broad categories of turbines: impulse turbines (notably the Pelton) in which a jet of water impinges on the runner designed to reverse the direction of the jet and thereby
extracts momentum from the water. This turbine is suitable for high 9
heads and `small' discharges. Reaction turbines (notably Francis and Kaplan) run full of water and in effect generate hydrodynamic `lift' forces to propel the runner blades. These turbines are suitable for medium to low heads, and medium to large discharges.


ocean energy tidal power Tidal power can be harnessed by constructing a dam or barrage across an estuary or bay with a tidal range of at least five metres. Gates in the barrage allow the incoming tide to build up in a basin behind it. The gates then close so that when the tide flows out the water can be channelled through turbines to generate electricity. Tidal barrages have been built across estuaries in France, Canada and China but a mixture of high cost projections coupled with environmental objections to the effect on estuarial habitats has limited the technology's further expansion.
9

wave and tidal stream power In wave power generation, a structure interacts with the incoming waves, converting this energy to electricity through a hydraulic, mechanical or pneumatic power take-off system. The structure is kept in position by a mooring system or placed directly on the seabed/seashore. Power is transmitted to the seabed by a flexible submerged electrical cable and to shore by a sub-sea cable.
Wave power converters can be made up from connected groups of smaller generator units of 100 ­ 500 kW, or several mechanical or hydraulically interconnected modules can supply a single larger turbine generator unit of 2 ­ 20 MW. The large waves needed to make the technology more cost effective are mostly found at great distances from the shore, however, requiring costly sub-sea cables to transmit the power. The converters themselves also take up large amounts of space. Wave power has the advantage of providing a more predictable supply than wind energy and can be located in the ocean without much visual intrusion.
There is no commercially leading technology on wave power conversion at present. Different systems are being developed at sea for prototype testing. The largest grid-connected system installed so far is the 2.25 MW Pelamis, with linked semi-submerged cyclindrical sections, operating off the coast of Portugal. Most development work has been carried out in the UK.


Using energy efficiently is cheaper than producing fresh energy and often has multiple positive effects. An efficient clothes washing machine or dishwasher, for example uses less power and less water. Efficiency also usually provides a higher level of comfort. A wellinsulated house, for instance, will feel warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer and be healthier to live in. An efficient refrigerator will make less noise, have no frost inside, no condensation outside and will probably last longer. Efficient lighting will offer you more light where you need it. Efficiency is thus really `more with less'.
There are very simple steps a householder can take, such as putting additional insulation in the roof, using super-insulating glazing or buying a high-efficiency washing machine when the old one wears out. All of these examples will save both money and energy. But the biggest savings will not be found in such incremental steps. The real gains come from rethinking the whole concept - `the whole house', `the whole car' or even `the whole transport system'. When you do this, energy needs can often be cut back by four to ten times.
In order to find out the global and regional energy efficiency
10 potential, the Dutch institute Ecofys developed energy demand
scenarios for this update of the Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution analysis. These scenarios cover energy demand over the period 2005-2050 for ten world regions. Two low energy demand scenarios for energy efficiency improvements have been defined. The first is based on the best technical energy efficiency potentials and is called `Technical'. The second is based on more moderate energy savings taking into account implementation constraints in terms of costs and other barriers. This scenario is called `Revolution'. The main results of the study are summarised below.
The starting point for the Ecofys analysis is that worldwide final energy demand is expected to grow by 95%, from 290 EJ in 2005 to 570 EJ in 2050, if we continue with business as usual. In the light of increasing fossil fuel prices, depleting resources and climate change, business as usual is simply not an option.

Final energy demand (EJ)

Growth in the transport sector is projected to be the largest, with energy demand expected to grow from 84 EJ in 2005 to 183 EJ in 2050. Demand for buildings and agriculture is expected to grow the least, from 91 EJ in 2005 to 124 EJ in 2050. Under the energy [r]evolution scenario, however, growth in energy demand can be limited to an increase of 28% up to 2050 in comparison to the 2005 level, whilst taking into account implementation constraints in terms of costs and other barriers. In Figure 10.2 the potential for energy efficiency improvements under this scenario are presented. The baseline is 2005 final energy demand per region. Table 10.1 shows that total worldwide energy demand has reduced to 376 PJ by 2050, with a breakdown by sector.
figure 10.1: reference scenario (business as usual) for worldwide final energy demand by sector

Since homes account for the largest share of energy demand from buildings, this section examines in detail the savings potential in households. Breakdowns of electricity use in the core EU-15 countries and the new member states are given in Figure 10.4 and Figure 10.5. A breakdown of electricity demand in the services sector can be found in Figure 10.6.
figure 10.4: breakdown of electricity use for residential end-use equipment in EU-15 countries in 2004
(BERTOLDI & ATANASIU, 2006)

Based on the results from three studies43, we have assumed the following breakdowns for energy use (fuel and electricity) under the Reference Scenario in 2050. Insufficient information is available to make a breakdown by world region. We assume however that the pattern for different regions will converge over the years.
Since an estimated 80% of fuel use in buildings is for space heating, the energy efficiency improvement potential here is considered to be large. In order to determine the potential for efficiency improvement in space heating we looked at the energy demand per m2 floor area per heating degree day (HDD). Heating degree days indicate the number of degrees that a day's average temperature is under 18°C, the temperature below which buildings
10 need to be heated.
The typical current heating demand for dwellings is 70-120 kJ/m2 44. Dwellings with a low energy use consume below 32 kJ/m2/, however, more than 70% less than the current level.

the low energy household
Technologies to reduce energy demand applied in this typical household are45:
· Triple-glazed windows with low emittance coatings. These windows greatly reduce heat loss to 40% compared to windows with one layer. The low emittance coating prevents energy waves in sunlight coming through, reducing the need for cooling.
· Insulation of roofs, walls, floors and basement. Proper insulation reduces heating and cooling demand by 50% in comparison to typical energy demand.
· Passive solar techniques make use of solar energy through the building's design - siting and window orientation. The term `passive' indicates that no mechanical equipment is used. All solar gains come through the windows.
· Balanced ventilation with heat recovery means that heated indoor air is channelled to a heat recovery unit and used to heat incoming outdoor air.
Current space heating demands in kJ per square metre per heating degree day for OECD dwellings are given in the table below.

space heating savings for new buildings We have assumed under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario that from 2010 onwards, all new dwellings will be low energy buildings using 48 kJ/m2/HDD. Since there is no data on current average energy consumption for dwellings in non-OECD countries, we have had to make assumptions for these regions. The potential for fuel savings46 is considered to be small in developing regions and about the same as the OECD in the Transition Economies. From this study we have taken the potential for developing regions to be equal to a 1.4% energy efficiency improvement per year, including replacing existing homes with more energy efficient housing (retrofitting). For the Transition Economies we have assumed the average OECD savings potential. For new homes, the savings compared to the average current dwelling are given in Table 10.4.

space heating savings by retrofit As well as constructing efficient new buildings there is a large savings potential to be found in retrofitting existing buildings. Important retrofit options are more efficient windows and insulation. According to the OECD/IEA, the first can save 39% of space heating energy demand while the latter can save 32% of space heating or cooling. Energy consumption in existing buildings in Europe could therefore decrease by more than 50%47. In OECD Europe and for the other regions we assume the same relative reductions as for new buildings, to take into account current average efficiency of dwellings in the regions. For existing homes, the savings compared to the average current dwelling are given in the table below.

In order to calculate the overall potential we need to know the share of new and existing buildings in 2050. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe database48 contains data on the total housing stock, the increase from new construction and population. We have assumed that the total housing stock grows along with the population. The number of existing dwellings also decreases each year due to a certain level of replacement. On average this is about 1.3% of the total housing stock per year, meaning a 40% replacement over 40 years, the equivalent of an average house lifetime of 100 years. Figure 10.6 shows how the future housing stock could develop in The Netherlands.

references 46 ÜRGE-VORSATZ & NOVIKOVA (2008) 47 OECD/IEA,2006 48 UNECE, `HUMAN SETTLEMENT DATABASE', 2008
This example illustrates that new dwellings in The Netherlands (and therefore OECD Europe) make up 7% of the total housing stock in 2050 and retrofits account for 41%. Although the UNECE database does not have data for countries in all regions of the world, the percentages of new and retrofit houses in 2050 are not dependent on the absolute number of dwellings but only on the rate of population growth and the 1.3% assumption. This means that we can use the population growth to make forecasts for other regions (see Table 10.6).

1. standby power consumption Standby power consumption is the ""lowest power consumption which cannot be switched off (influenced) by the user and may persist for an indefinite time when an appliance is connected to the mains electricity supply""49. In other words, the energy available when an appliance is connected to the power supply is not being used. Some appliances also consume energy when they are not on standby and are also not being used for their primary function, for example when an appliance has reached the end of a cycle but the `on' button is still engaged. This consumption does not fit into the definition of standby power but could still account for a substantial amount of energy use.
Reducing standby losses provides a major opportunity for costeffective energy savings. Nowadays, many appliances can be remotely and/or instantly activated or have a continuous digital display, and therefore require a standby mode. Standby power accounts for 20­90W per home in developed nations, ranging from 4 to 10% of total residential electricity use50 and 3-12% of total residential electricity use worldwide51. Printers use 30-40% of their full power requirement when idle, as do televisions and music equipment. Set-top boxes used in conjunction with televisions tend to consume even more energy on standby than in use. Typical standby use of different types of electrical devices is shown in Figure 10.8.

Globally, people consume 3 Mega-lumen-hrs (Mlmh) of residential electric light per capita/year. The average North American uses 13.2 Mlmh, the average Chinese 1.5 Mlmh - still 300 times the average artificial per capita light use in England in the nineteenth century. The average Japanese uses 18.5 Mlmh and the average European or Australian 2.7Mlmh. There is a clear relationship between GDP per capita and lighting consumption in Mlmh/cap/yr (see Figure 10.11).

It is important to realise that lighting energy savings are not just a question of using more efficient lamps but also involve other approaches. These include making smarter use of daylight, reducing light absorption by luminaires (the fixture in which the lamp is housed), optimising lighting levels (levels in OECD countries commonly exceed recommended values), using automatic controls (turn off when no one is present, dim artificial light in response to rising daylight) and retrofitting buildings to make better use of daylight. Buildings designed to optimise daylight can receive up to 70% of their annual illumination needs from daylight, while a typical building will only get 20 to 25%55. In a study by Bertoldi & Atanasiu (2006), national lighting consumption and CFL penetration data is presented for the EU-27 countries (and candidate country Croatia). We used this data as the basis for household penetration rates and lighting electricity consumption in OECD Europe. As well as standby, lighting is an important source of cost-effective savings. The IEA publication ""Light's Labour's Lost"" (2006) projects that the costeffective savings potential from energy efficient lighting in 2030 is at least 38% of lighting electricity consumption, even disregarding newer and promising solid state lighting technologies such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). In order to determine the savings potential for lighting, it is important to know the percentage of households with energy efficient lamps and the penetration level of these lamps. Based on Bertoldi & Atanasiu (2006) and Waide (2006) we calculated the shares shown in Table 10.7.



Based on the studies already cited we calculate that a maximum of 80% savings can result from the introduction of efficient residential lighting in the Technical scenario and 70% in the [R]evolution Scenario. These savings not only include using energy efficient lamps but behavioural changes and maximising daylight use. Since the penetration of energy efficient lamps differs per household, we have assumed that the savings potential is the maximum saving multiplied by 1 minus the penetration rate. The resulting savings are given in Table 10.8.

3. Set-top boxes Set-top boxes (STBs) are used to decode satellite or cable television programmes and are a major new source of energy demand. More than a billion are projected to be purchased worldwide over the next decade. The energy use of an average set-top box is 2030 W, but it uses nearly the same amount of energy when switched off56. In the USA, STB energy use is estimated at 15 TWh/year, or about 1.3% of residential electricity use57. With more advanced uses, for instance digital video recorders (DVRs), STB energy use is forecast to triple to 45 TWh/year by 2010 ­ an 18% annual growth rate and 4% of 2010 residential electricity use.
Because of their short lifetimes (on average five years) and high ownership growth rates, STBs provide an opportunity for significant short term energy savings. Cable/satellite boxes without DVRs use 100 to 200 kWh of electricity per year, whilst combined with DVRs they use between 200 and 400 kWh per year. Media receiver boxes use less energy (around 35 kWh per year) but must be used in conjunction with existing audiovisual equipment and computers, thus adding another 35 kWh to the annual energy use of existing home electronics. Figure 10.12 shows the annual energy use of common household appliances. This shows that the energy use of some set-top boxes approaches that of the major energy consuming household appliances.

Reducing the energy use of set-top boxes is complicated by their complex operating and communication modes. Although improvements in power supply design and efficiency will be effective in reducing energy use, the major savings will be obtained through energy management measures. The study by Rainer et al (2004) reports a savings potential of between 32% and 54% over five years (2005-2010). Assuming that these drastic measures have not yet been applied and due to lack of data on other regions, we have taken these reduction percentages as the global potential up to 2050.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

4. cold appliances The average household in OECD Europe consumed 700 kWh/year of electricity for food refrigeration in 2000 compared with 1,034 kWh/year in Japan, 1 216 kWh/year in OECD Australasia and 1,294 kWh/year in OECD North America. These figures illustrate differences in average household storage capacities, the ratio of frozen to fresh food use, ambient temperatures and humidity, and food storage temperatures and control58. European households typically either have a refrigerator-freezer in the kitchen (sometimes with an additional freezer or refrigerator), or they have a refrigerator and a separate freezer. Practical height and width limits place constraints on the available internal storage space for an appliance. Similar constraints apply in Japanese households, where ownership of a single refrigerator-freezer is the norm, but are less pressing in OECD North America and Australia. In these countries almost all households have a refrigerator-freezer and many also have a separate freezer and occasionally a separate refrigerator.

Looking in detail at the situation in the European Union, we found that in 2003, 103 TWh of electricity was consumed by household cold appliances alone (15% of total 2004 residential end use). A cold appliance with an energy use rating of A++ uses 120 kWh per year, while a comparable appliance with energy rating B uses 300 kWh per year and with rating C 600 kWh per year59. The average energy rating of appliances sold in the EU-15 countries is still B. If only A++ appliances were sold, energy consumption would be 60% less. The average lifetime of a cold appliance is 15 years, which means that 15 years from the introduction of only A++ labelled appliances, 60% less energy would be used in the EU-15. According to the European Commission (see Table 10.9), consumption in TWh/y could decrease from 103 in 2003 to 80 in 2010 with additional policies to encourage efficient appliances. This means that the energy efficiency of cold appliances could increase by about 3.5% each year.

5. computers and servers The average desktop computer uses about 120 W per hour - the monitor 75 W and the central processing unit 45 W - and the average laptop 30 W per hour. Current best practice monitors60 use only 18 W (15 inch screen), which is 76% less than the average. Savings for computers are especially important in the commercial sector. According to a 2006 US study, computers and monitors have the highest energy consumption in an office after lighting. In Europe, office equipment use is considered to be less important (see Figure 4), but estimates differ widely61. Some studies have shown that automatic and/or manual power management of computers and monitors can significantly reduce their energy consumption.
A power managed computer consumes less than half the energy of a computer without power management62, depending on how your computer is used; power management can reduce the annual energy consumption of a computer and monitor by as much as 80%63. Approximately half of all office computers are left on overnight and at weekends (75% of the time). Apart from switching off at night, using LCD (liquid crystal display) monitors requires less energy than CRT (cathode ray tube). An average LCD screen uses 79% less energy than an average CRT monitor if both are power-managed64. Further savings can be made by ensuring computers enter low power mode when they are idle during the day. Another benefit of decreasing the power consumption of computers and monitors is that it reduces the load for air conditioning. According to a 2002 study by Roth et al, office equipment increases the air conditioning load by 0.2-0.5 kW per kW of office equipment power consumption.
The average computer with a CRT monitor in constant operation uses 1,236 kWh/y (482kWh/y for the computer and 754kWh/y for the monitor). With power management this reduces to 190kWh/y (86+104). Effective power management can save 1,046kWh per computer and CRT monitor per year, a reduction of 84%, or 505kWh per computer and LCD monitor per year. These examples illustrate that power management can have a greater effect than just more efficient equipment. The German website EcoTopten, for example, says that more efficient computers save 50-70% compared with older models and efficient flat-screens use 70% less energy than CRTs.
Servers are multiprocessor systems running commercial workloads65. The typical breakdown of peak power server use is shown in Table 10.10.

Data centres are facilities that primarily contain electronic equipment used for data processing, data storage and communications networking66. 80% of servers are located in these data centres67. Worldwide, about three million data centres and 32 million servers are in operation. Approximately 25% of servers are located in the EU, but only 10% of data centres, meaning that on average each data centre hosts a relatively large number of servers (Fichter, 2007). The installed base of servers is growing rapidly due to an increasing demand for data processing and storage. New digital services such as music downloads, video-on-demand, online banking, electronic trading, satellite navigation and internet telephony spur this rapid growth, as well as the increasing penetration of computers and the internet in developing countries. Since systems have become more and more complex to handle increasingly large amounts of data, power and energy consumption (about 50% used for cooling68) have grown in parallel. The power density of data centres is rising by approximately 15% each year69. Aggregate electricity use for servers doubled over the period 2000 to 2005 both in the US and worldwide (see Figure 10.13). Data

Power and energy consumption are key concerns for internet data centres and there is a significant potential for energy efficiency improvements. Existing technologies and design strategies have been shown to reduce the energy use of a typical server by 25% or more70. Energy management efforts in existing data centres could reduce their energy usage by around 20%, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The US EPA scenario for reducing server energy use includes

measures such as enabling power management, consolidating

servers and storage, using liquid instead of air cooling, improving

the efficiency of chillers, pumps, fans and transformers and using

combined heat and power. This bundle of measures could reduce

electricity use by up to 56% compared to current efficiency trends

(or 60% compared to historical trends), the EPA concludes,

representing the maximum technical potential by 2011. This

assumes that only 50% of current data centres can introduce these

measures. A significant savings potential is therefore available for

servers and data centres around the world by 2050. For computers

10

and servers we have based the savings potential on the WBCSD 2005 report and other sources mentioned in this section. For the

Technical scenario this would result in 70% savings, for the

[R]evolution Scenario 55% savings.


6. air conditioning Today in the USA, some 14 % of total electrical consumption is used to air condition buildings71. Increasing use of small air conditioning units (less than 12 kW output cooling power) in southern European cities, mainly during the summer months, is also driving up electricity consumption. Total residential electricity consumption for air conditioners in the EU-25 in 2005 was estimated to be between 7 and 10 TWh per year72. However, we should not underestimate the consumption in developing countries. Many of these are located in warm climatic zones. With the rapid development of its economy and improving living standards, central air conditioning units are now widely used in China, for example. They currently account for about 20% of total Chinese electricity consumption73.
There are several options for technological savings in air conditioning equipment. One is to use a different refrigerant. Tests with the refrigerant Ikon B show possible energy consumption reductions of 2025% compared to the commonly used liquids74. However, behavioural changes should not be overlooked. One example of a smart alternative to cooling a whole house was developed by the company Evening Breeze. This combined a mosquito net, bed and air conditioning so that only the bed had to be cooled instead of the whole bedroom.
There are also other options for cooling, such as geothermal cooling by heat pumps. This uses the same principle as geothermal heating, namely that the temperature at a certain depth below the Earth's surface remains constant year round. In the winter we can use this relatively high temperature to warm our houses. Conversely, we can use the relatively cold temperature in the summer to cool our houses. There are several technical concepts available, but all rely on transferring the heat from the air in the building to the Earth. A refrigerant is used as the heat transfer medium. This concept is cost-effective75. Heat pumps have been gaining market share in a number of countries76.
Solar energy can also be used for cooling through the use of solar thermal energy or solar electricity to power a cooling appliance. Basic types of solar cooling technologies include absorption cooling (uses solar thermal energy to vapourise the refrigerant); desiccant cooling (uses solar thermal energy to regenerate (dry) the desiccant); vapour compression cooling (uses solar thermal energy to operate a Rankinecycle heat engine); evaporative cooling; and heat pumps and air conditioners that can be powered by solar photovoltaic systems. To drive the pumps only 0.05 kWh of electricity is needed, instead of 0.35 kWh for regular air conditioning77, representing a savings potential of 85%.
Not only is it important to use efficient air conditioning equipment, it is equally important to reduce the need for air conditioning in the first place. Important ways to reduce cooling demand are to use insulation to prevent heat from entering the building, to reduce the amount of inefficient appliances present in the house, such as incandescent lamps or old refrigerators that give off unusable heat, to use cool exterior finishes, such as `cool roof' technology or lightcoloured wall paint, to improve windows and use vegetation to reduce the amount of heat that comes into the house, and to use ventilation instead of air conditioning units.
For air conditioning we have assumed that the savings potential based on the 2005 WBCSD study and other sources mentioned in this section will amount to 70% savings under the Technical scenario and 55% savings under the [R]evolution Scenario.


total household savings
Total savings from the previous sections are summarised here. Table 10.11 shows the total savings in percentages up to 2050. These need to be translated into energy efficiency improvements per year to compare them with the Reference Scenario. Since it is not clear what assumptions this is based on, we have assumed an efficiency improvement of 1% per year. Subtracting this from the reduction potentials in Table 10.12 shows the energy efficiency improvements per year measured against the Reference Scenario. Electricity use in the `Other' sector is assumed to decline at the same rate as residential electricity use (lighting, appliances, cold appliances, computers/servers and air conditioning). We have assumed a minimum energy efficiency improvement of 1.2% in the Technical scenario and 1.1% in the [R]evolution Scenario, including autonomous improvements.
the standard household
In order to enable a specific level of energy demand as a basic ""right"" for all people in the world, we have developed the model of an efficient Standard Household. A fully equipped OECD household (including fridge, oven, TV, radio, music centre, computer, lights etc.) currently consumes between 1,500 and 3,400 kWh/a per person. With an average of two to four people per household the total consumption is therefore between 3,000 and 12,000 kWh/a. This demand could be reduced to about 550 kWh/a per person just by using the most efficient appliances available on the market today. This does not even include any significant lifestyle changes. Based on this assumption, the `over-consumption' of all households in OECD countries totals more than 2,100 billion kilowatt-hours. Comparing this figure with the current per capita consumption in developing countries, they would have the right to use about 1,350
10 billion kilowatt-hours more. The `oversupply' of OECD households
could therefore fill the gap in energy supply to developing countries one and a half times over.
By implementing a strict technical standard for all electrical appliances, in order to achieve a level of 550 kWh/a per capita consumption, it would be possible to switch off more than 340 coal power plants in OECD countries.

energy efficiency standards - the potential is huge
Setting energy efficiency standards for electrical equipment could have a huge impact on the world's power sector. A large number of power plants could be switched off if strict technical standards were brought into force. The table below provides an overview of the theoretical potential for using efficiency standards based on

currently available technology. The Energy [R]evolution Scenario has not been calculated on the basis of this theoretical potential. However, this overview illustrates how many power plants producing electricity would not be needed if all global appliances were brought up to the highest efficiency standards overnight.

BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY

Transport is a key element in reducing the level of greenhouse gases produced by energy consumption. 28% of current energy use comes from the transport sector ­ road, rail and sea. In order to assess the present status of global transport, including its carbon footprint, a special study was undertaken by Ecofys.
This chapter gives an overview of how the Ecofys Reference Scenario was originated and the changes expected under the Energy [R]evolution Scenario. The following chapter looks specifically at the technical efficiency potential for cars. The main actions proposed in the Energy [R]evolution Scenario are: increasing the use of public transport, especially trains, reducing the number of kilometres driven each year by private cars, and introducing more efficient vehicles.

· Medium duty trucks include medium haul trucks and delivery vehicles.
· Buses have been divided into two size classes - full size buses and minibuses - with the latter roughly encompassing the range of small buses and large passenger vans prevalent around the developing world and typically used for informal transit services.
· All air travel in each region (domestic and international) is treated together.
The Figures below show the breakdown of final energy demand for transport by mode in 2005 and 2050.

the reference scenario for transport
In order to calculate possible savings in the transport sector, we first need to construct a detailed Reference Scenario. This needs to include detailed shares and energy intensity data per mode of transport and per region up to 2050. Although this data cannot be found in the IEA WEO, input is available from the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) mobility database. This database was completed in 2004 after collaboration between the IEA and the WBCSD's Sustainable Mobility Project to develop a global transport model. Those transport options have been selected which can be expected to result in a substantial reduction in energy demand up to 2050.
In order to estimate the energy demand per transport sub-sector, we need the modal shares per region up to 2050. These can be calculated by using the WBCSD final energy use per mode, adding them together and working out the share per mode in % by region from 2005-2050. In the OECD, for example, light duty vehicles (LDVs) account for 57% of total energy use, heavy trucks for 15%.
Since international shipping spreads across all regions of the world, it has been left out whilst calculating the baseline figures. The total is therefore made up of LDVs, heavy and medium duty freight, two to three wheel vehicles, buses, minibuses, rail, air and national marine transport. Although energy use from international marine bunkers (international shipping fuel suppliers) is not included in these calculations, it is still estimated to account for 9% of worldwide transport final energy demand in 2005 and 7% by 2050. A recent UN report concluded that carbon dioxide emissions from shipping are much greater than initially thought and increasing at an alarming rate. It is therefore very important to improve the energy efficiency of international shipping. Possible options are examined later in this chapter.
The definitions of different transport modes for this scenario78 are:
· Light-duty vehicles (LDVs) are defined as four-wheel vehicles used primarily for personal passenger road travel. These are typically cars, SUVs (Sports Utility Vehicles), small passenger vans (up to eight seats) and personal pickup trucks. Within this report we will sometimes call light-duty vehicles simply `cars'.
· Heavy duty trucks are defined here as long haul trucks operating almost exclusively on diesel fuel. These trucks carry large loads with lower energy intensity (energy use per tonne-kilometre of haulage) than medium duty trucks such as delivery trucks.

As can be seen from the above figures, the largest share of energy demand comes from cars, although it slightly decreases from 48% in 2005 to 44% in 2050. The share of air transport increases from 13% to 19%. Of particular note is the high share of road transport in total transport energy demand: 82% in 2005 and 74% in 2050. The Figures below show world final energy use for the transport sector by region in 2005 and 2050.


As we can see, OECD Europe has the highest final energy use, followed by OECD North America and OECD Pacific. Over time, the shares of these regions will decrease while the shares of all other regions will increase. In 2050, OECD Europe will still be the largest final energy user, but now followed by China. Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4 show the forecast worldwide growth of different passenger and freight transport modes. Light duty vehicles will remain the most important mode of passenger transport, air,

passenger rail and two wheeled transport are expected to grow considerably, while three wheeled transport is expected to grow only slightly. Buses and minibus passenger transport is expected to decline a little. Heavy duty trucks will remain the most important mode of freight transport. Freight rail, inland navigation and medium duty trucks will also increase, but will remain `inferior' modes in the Reference Scenario.


the future of the transport sector in the energy [r]evolution scenario
The Reference Scenario shows that changes in patterns of passenger travel are partly a consequence of growing wealth. As GDP per capita increases, people tend to migrate towards faster, more flexible and more expensive travel modes (from buses and trains to cars and air). With faster modes, people also tend to travel further and do not reduce the amount of time spent travelling79. There is also a strong correlation between GDP growth and increases in freight transport. More economic activity will mean more transport of raw materials, intermediary products and final consumer goods.
All the above figures and tables illustrate the importance of both a modal shift and a slowing of growth in forecast transport if emissions reductions are to be achieved. Furthermore, it is very important to make the remaining transport as clean as possible, signalling the role of energy efficiency improvements. Unlimited growth in the transport sector is simply not an option. A shift towards a sustainable energy system, which respects natural limits and saves the world's climate, requires a mix of lifestyle changes and new technologies. We basically need to use our cars less, fly
11 less and use more public transport, as well as cutting down the
transport kilometres for freight transport whilst introducing more new and highly efficient vehicles.
technical potentials We have looked at three options for decreasing energy demand in the transport sector:
· Reduction of transport demand.
· Modal shift from high energy intensive transport modes to low energy intensity.
· Energy efficiency improvements.
step 1: reduction of transport demand A reduction in transport demand involves reducing passenger-km per capita and reducing freight transport demand. The amount of freight transport is to a large extent linked to GDP development and therefore difficult to influence. However, by improved logistics, for example optimal load profiles for trucks, the demand can be limited.
passenger transport First we must look at reducing passenger transport demand. For this we need to examine the transport demand per capita in the Reference Scenario, as shown in Table 11.3. This shows that transport demand is highest in OECD North America, followed by the OECD Pacific. Demand per capita is lowest in Africa and India.
The potential for reducing passenger transport demand is very difficult to determine. For OECD countries we have assumed that transport demand per capita can be reduced by 10% by 2050 in comparison to the Reference Scenario. For the non-OECD countries we have assumed in the [R]evolution Scenario ­ as a matter of equity - no reduction in transport demand per capita because the current demand is already quite low in comparison to the OECD. We have made an exception for the Transition Economies, where we assume that transport demand per capita can be reduced by 5% in 2050.
The table below shows the profile of passenger transport demand per capita in 2005, development under the Reference Scenario by 2050 and the reduced transport demand under the [R]evolution Scenario, broken down by region.


freight transport In the Reference Scenario the largest absolute increase in freight transport demand is expected in the Transition Economies, whilst the largest percentage increase is forecast in China (383%). The potential for reducing demand for freight transport by improved logistics is difficult to estimate. For the [R]evolution Scenario we have assumed that freight transport demand can be reduced by 5% in comparison to the Reference Scenario, although only through measures in the OECD and Transition Economies.

step 2: changes in transport mode In order to decide which vehicles or transport systems are the most effective for each purpose, an analysis of the different technologies is needed. To calculate the energy savings achieved by shifting transport mode we need to know the energy use and intensity for each type of transport80. The following information is needed:
· Passenger transport: Energy demand per passenger kilometre, measured in MJ/p-km.
· Freight transport: Energy demand per kilometre of transported tonne of goods, measured in MJ/ tonne-km.
development of passenger transport Passenger transport includes cars, minibuses, two and three wheelers, buses, passenger rail and air transport. Freight transport includes medium trucks, heavy trucks, national marine and freight rail. The figures below show a breakdown of passenger transport by mode in the Reference Scenario for 2005 and 2050 (as % of total passenger-km). The global demand for air transport is expected to grow from 12% in 2005 to 23% in 2050.


travelling by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.8 shows the worldwide average specific energy consumption by transport mode under the Reference Scenario in 2005 and 2050. This data differs for each region. As can be seen, the difference in specific energy consumption for each transport mode is large. Passenger transport by rail will consume 85% less energy in 2050 than car transport and by bus nearly 70% less energy. This means that there is a large energy savings potential to be realised by a modal shift.
modal shift for passengers in the energy [r]evolution scenario From the figures above we can conclude that in order to reduce transport energy demand by modal shift, passengers have to move from cars and air transport to the lower intensity passenger rail and bus transport. As an indication of the action required we can take Japan as a `best practice country'. In 2004, Japan had a large share of p-km by rail (29%) thanks to the fact that it had established a strong urban and regional rail system81. Comparing different regions with the example of Japan, and assuming that 40 years is enough time to build up an extensive rail network, the following modal shifts have been assumed:
table 11.4: passenger modal shifts assumed in [r]evolution scenario


freight transport Figures 11.9 and 11.10 show the breakdown of freight transport in percentages of total tonnes-km per year and by region under the Reference Scenario. Both the Transition Economies and China have a very large proportion of rail transport while the Developing Asia and the Middle East have a very small share. The share of heavy and medium trucks is very large in the Developing Asia countries and OECD Europe. National marine transport plays an important role in the OECD Pacific. The figures also show that the difference between 2005 and 2050 is relatively small.

transporting goods by rail is the most efficient Figure 11.12 shows the energy intensity for world average freight transport in 2005 and 2050 under the Reference Scenario. Energy intensity for all modes of transport is expected to decrease by 2050.

modal shift for transporting goods in the energy [r]evolution scenario From the figures above we can conclude that in order to reduce transport energy demand by modal shift, freight has to move from medium and heavy duty trucks to the less energy intensive freight rail and national marine. Canada is a `best practice' country in this respect, with 29% of freight transported by trucks, 39% by rail and 32% by ships. Since the use of ships largely depends on the geography of the country, we do not propose a modal shift for national ships but instead a shift towards freight rail. China, OECD Pacific and the Transition Economies already have a low share of truck usage, so for these regions we will not assume a modal shift. For the other regions we have assumed the following changes:

marine transport Since the WBCSD did not provide estimates for total national marine tonnes-km per year or energy intensities per region, we have calculated these ourselves. Data for energy intensity for the year 2005 in OECD countries was found in OECD/IEA, 2007. For other regions we have assumed that the highest OECD estimate would hold. The 2050 intensities were extrapolated from 2005 data using 1% per year autonomous efficiency improvement. The amount of t-km per year could then be calculated using the Reference Scenario energy use divided by the energy intensity in MJ/t-km.
case 11.1: wind powered ships
Introduced to commercial operation in 2007, the SkySails system allows wind power, which has no fuel costs, to contribute to the motive power of large freight-carrying ships, which currently use increasingly expensive and environmentally damaging oil. Instead of a traditional sail fitted to a mast, the system uses large towing kites to contribute to the ship's propulsion. Shaped like paragliders, they are tethered to the vessel by ropes and can be controlled automatically, responding to wind conditions
11 and the ship's trajectory.
The kites can operate at altitudes of between 100 and 300 metres, where stronger and more stable winds prevail. By means of dynamic flight patterns, the SkySails are able to generate five times more power per square metre of sail area than conventional sails. Depending on the prevailing winds, the company claims that a ship's average annual fuel costs can be reduced by 10 to 35%. Under optimal wind conditions, fuel consumption can temporarily be cut by up to 50%.
On the first voyage of the Beluga SkySails, a 133m long specially built cargo ship, the towing kite propulsion system was able to temporarily substitute for approximately 20 % of the vessel's main engine power, even in moderate winds. The company is now planning a kite twice the size of this 160m2 pilot.
The designers say that virtually all sea-going cargo vessels can be retro- or outfitted with the SkySails propulsion system without extensive modifications. If 1,600 ships would be equiped with these sails by 2015 ,it would save over 146 million tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to about 15% of Germany's total emissions.

step 3: efficiency improvements or travelling with less energy Energy efficiency improvements are the third important way of reducing transport energy demand. This section explains the different possibilities for improving energy efficiency82 up to 2050 for each type of transport: · Air transport · Passenger and freight trains · Buses and mini-buses · Trucks · Ships for marine transport · Motorcycles · Cars air transport Savings for air transport have been taken from Akerman, 2005. He reports that a 65% reduction in fuel use is technically feasible by 2050. This has been applied to 2005 energy intensity data in order to calculate the technical potential. The figure below shows the energy intensity per region in the Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.
passenger and freight trains Savings for passenger and freight rail transport have been taken from Fulton & Eads (2004). They report a historic improvement in the fuel economy of passenger rail of 1% per year and for freight rail of between 2 and 3% per year. Since no other studies are available we have assumed for the Technical scenario a 1% improvement of in energy efficiency per year for passenger rail and 2.5% for freight rail. The figure below shows the energy intensity per region in the Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.

freight rail Savings for freight rail are taken from the same study as for passenger rail. They report a historic improvement in the fuel economy of freight rail of between 2 and 3% per year. Since no other studies are available we have assumed for the Technical scenario a 2.5% improvement in energy efficiency per year. The figure below shows the energy intensity per region in the Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.


Energy intensities for passenger rail transport are assumed to be the same for all regions due to a lack of sufficiently detailed data. The differentiation in energy intensity for freight rail is based on the following assumption: regions with longer average distances for freight rail (such as the US and Former Soviet Union), and where more raw materials are transported (such as coal), show a lower energy intensity than other regions (Fulton & Eads, 2004). Future projections use ten year historic IEA data. Rail intensities are and will remain highest in OECD Europe and OECD Pacific and lowest in India.

buses and minibuses The company Enova Systems is promoting a `clean bus' with a 100% improvement in fuel economy. We have adopted this improvement and applied it to 2005 energy intensity numbers per region. For minibuses the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy reports83 a fuel economy improvement of 55% by 2015. Since this is a very ambitious target and will most likely not be reached, we have extended it up to 2050 and adopted it as the technical potential (see Figure 11.16 and Figure 11.17). Currently, buses in North America consume far and away the most energy. The Reference Scenario predicts an increase in all regions between 2005 and 2050. Although in general more efficient buses are being produced, this is offset by increases in average bus size, weight and power. OECD buses have much more powerful engines than nonOECD buses, but the latter are likely to catch up over this period.
figure 11.16: energy intensities for buses in the reference and [r]evolution scenarios

trucks (freight by road) Elliott et al., 2006 give possible savings for heavy and medium-duty freight trucks. This list of reduction options is expanded in Lensink and De Wilde, 2007. For medium duty trucks a fuel economy saving of 50% is reported by 2030 (mainly due to hybridisation). We applied this percentage to 2005 energy intensity data, calculated the fuel economy improvement per year and extrapolated this yearly growth rate up to 2050. For heavy duty trucks we applied the same methodology, arriving at a 39% savings. Current intensities are highest in the Middle East, India and Africa and lowest in OECD North America. The Reference Scenario predicts that future values will converge, assuming past improvement percentages and assuming a higher learning rate in developing regions. The figures below show the energy intensity per region in the Reference Scenario and in the two low energy demand scenarios.

marine transport National marine savings have also been taken from the Lensink and De Wilde study. They report 20% savings in 2030 for inland navigation as a realistic potential with currently available technology, and ultimate efficiency savings of up to 30% for the current fleet. To arrive at the potential in 2050, we used the same approach as described for road freight above. OECD Pacific has the lowest current energy intensity due to the fact that they have a large proportion of long haul trips where larger (less energy intensive) boats can be used. All energy intensities are expected to improve by 1% per year up to 2050. Reference Scenario energy intensities and the technical potentials for national marine transport are shown in Figure 11.20.

motorcycles For two wheelers we have based the potential on IEA/SMP (2004), where 0.3 MJ/p.km is the lowest value. For three wheelers we have assumed that the technical potential is 0.5 MJ/p.km in 2050. The uncertainty in these potentials is high, although two and three wheelers only account for 1.5% of transport energy demand.

passenger cars This section is based on a special study conducted by the DLR's Institute for Vehicle Concepts to investigate the potential for improving the efficiency of existing cars and moving towards greater use of hybrid or electric vehicles. See Chapter 12 for a full account of this analysis.
Many technologies can be used to improve the fuel efficiency of passenger cars. Examples include improvements in engines, weight reduction and friction and drag reduction84. The impact of the various measures on fuel efficiency can be substantial. Hybrid vehicles, combining a conventional combustion engine with an electric engine, have relatively low fuel consumption. The most well-known is the Toyota Prius, which originally had a fuel efficiency of about five litres of gasoline-equivalent per 100 km (litre ge/100 km). Recently, Toyota presented an improved version with a lower fuel consumption of 4.3 litres ge/100 km. Further developments are underway, as shown by the presentation of new concept cars by the main US car manufacturers in 2000 with a specific fuel use as low as three litres ge/100 km. There are suggestions that applying new lightweight materials, in combination with the new propulsion technologies, can bring fuel consumption levels down to 1 litre ge/100 km.
Based on SRU (2005), the technical potential in 2050 for a diesel fuelled car is 1.6 and for a petrol car 2.0 litres ge/100 km. Based on the sources in Table 11.6, we have assumed 2.0 litres as the technical potential for Europe and adopted the same improvement in efficiency (about 3% per year) for other regions. In order to reach this target in time, these more efficient cars need to be on the market by 2030 ­ assuming that the maximum lifetime of a car is 20 years.
The energy intensities for car passenger transport are currently highest in OECD North America and Africa and lowest in OECD Europe. The Reference Scenario shows a decrease in energy intensities in all regions, but the division between highest and lowest will remain the same, although there will be some convergence. We have assumed that the occupancy rate for cars remains the same as in 2005, as shown in the figure below.

Since the global use of privately owned cars (light duty vehicles) currently accounts for more carbon dioxide emissions than any other form of transport, the DLR's Institute for Vehicle Concepts was commissioned to look specifically at the potential for reductions in this sector. At the same time, the door has already been opened for both major technological changes and shifts in personal habits. Rising oil prices, increasing concern about climate change and, in some regions, legislation on everything from bio fuels to vehicle emissions, have together combined to put pressure on international vehicle manufacturers to investigate solutions. Numerous technical fixes are already in production which can improve the efficiency of the predominant internal combustion engine, as well as moving towards alternatives no longer based on fossil fuels.
This specific study of the light duty vehicle market concludes that a number of measures could help reduce the CO2 emissions from cars very significantly to a target level of about 80 g CO2 per km for the European Union. These measures include a major shift to vehicles powered by (renewable) electricity, a range of efficiency improvements to the power trains of existing internal combustion engines and behavioural changes leading to an overall reduction in kilometres travelled.
methodology
The DLR developed a global scenario for cars based on a detailed bottom-up model covering ten world regions. The aim was to produce a challenging but feasible scenario which would lower global CO2 emissions within the context of the overall emission reduction objective. Cars contribute about 45% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the entire transport sector, the largest proportion of any mode.
This approach takes into account a vast range of technical measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles, but also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and annual mileage taking place in developing countries. The turnover of replacement vehicles has been modelled over five year stages from 2005 to 2050. The scenario assumes that a large share of renewable electricity is available in the future. The major parameters for achieving increased efficiency are:
· vehicle technology
· alternative fuels
· changes in sales by vehicle size
· changes in vehicle kilometres travelled
This section will examine the development of the world's car fleet in more detail and is focused on non-technical as well as technical solutions. Light duty vehicles and their technologies are divided into three vehicle segments (small, medium and large) and nine categories of fuel/propulsion technology:

· conventional petrol
· petrol hybrid
· conventional diesel
· diesel hybrid
· LPG/CNG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas/Compressed Natural Gas)
· LPG/CNG hybrid
· fuel cell hydrogen
· battery electric
· plug in-hybrid electric vehicles
As a Reference Scenario for the starting point in 2005, the analysis in the IEA/SMP model85 has been used.This is the most comprehensive and detailed model available for CO2 emissions from the global transport sector. For those technologies not included in the SMP model, we had to decide starting points for today's performance values (see below). We then created so-called `target reference vehicles' (TRVs), which project the energy consumption feasible for each of the main fuel conversion technologies.This is described in the section `Future vehicle technologies'. The TRVs will be introduced in the different regions of the world over a varying timescale. In general, the technologies to achieve the TRVs are aimed to be available for sale in 2050 - 42 years from now.
In general, we have first introduced the most recent - and most
expensive - technologies in the currently industrialised countries, and 12
postponed their introduction in the rest of the world. We have then used the option to change the energy source used to fuel light duty transport. This is described in the section `Projection of future technology mix'. Various non-technical measures are reflected in the projections for future vehicle sales (see `Projection of vehicle segment split'), in the projection for the absolute number of vehicles sold in the future (see `Projection of global vehicle stock development') and in the projection of how much individual vehicles are used compared to other transport means in the future (see `Projection of kilometres driven').
reference scenario
The IEA Reference Scenario developed for the Mobility 2030 project86 was used as the starting point for the year 2005 key data and for comparison as a `business as usual' scenario. It is important to note that for this scenario no major new policies were assumed to be implemented beyond those already introduced by 2003. While for some areas, such as pollution control, further so called policy trajectories have been assumed, this was not the case for fuel consumption. Trends in future fuel consumption are therefore based on historical (non-policy driven) trends87. If the serious discussions taking place in Europe and the United States on the regulation of fuel economy in new vehicles, together with legal guidelines and proposed long term targets, were taken into account, the business as usual case would be different. However, it is beyond the scope of this project to redefine the status quo. Nevertheless, we include the most recent political targets in our scenario.

energy [r]evolution car scenario
The alternative car scenario is targeted towards high CO2 reductions compared to today's levels. Summarised in brief, we have focused on the following proposals:
· Efficiency improvements resulting from technological development
· Renewable electricity as the primary alternative fuel
· Influencing customer behaviour in the long term
There is a huge potential for technological options to make today's vehicles more efficient while lowering their CO2 emissions. A car today converts the energy in the fuel into mechanical energy in order to take the compartment we sit in from point A to B, but it does it in a very inefficient way. Only 25% to 35% of the chemical energy in the fuel is converted into mechanical energy by the engine. The rest is lost as waste heat. Only 10% of the fuel energy is used to overcome driving resistance. Hybrid technologies mark an important starting point for making vehicles more efficient, whilst technologies to lower energy demand, such as lightweight design, reduced rolling resistance wheels and improved aerodynamics, will contribute to the achievement of very low fuel consumptions.
Renewable electricity can be produced almost everywhere in the world, and with declining costs in the future. Taking into account the enormous development in batteries in recent years, we believe that electric mobility as offered by battery electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is the preferred way to make major reductions in the CO2 emissions of cars.
Consumer behaviour is the third major key to a lower carbon world for the transport sector. Here we have relied on programmes, incentives and policy measures to support a shift towards low carbon emitting vehicles as well as reducing demand in general.

future vehicle technologies
The global vehicle market, with about 55 million vehicles sold per year, is enormous. Around 500 automobile plants produce this huge quantity. Regional markets differ in the size of vehicles and fuel type used. Depending on income, infrastructure and the spatial characteristics of the countries, people have different preferences for the size of vehicles they use.
The propulsion technology used in all new cars globally does not differ very much, however. For the sake of simplicity, therefore, we have defined the reference target vehicles, which we use throughout the world, as characterised by their energy consumption `tank-towheel', independent of the fuel used. The energy consumption for the reference target vehicles are presented in Figure 12.3.
Differences in energy consumption `tank-to-wheel' shown in Figure 12.3 reflect the different efficiencies with which vehicles convert fuel energy into movement. The various fuels and energy sources have different qualities, depending on their upstream production processes. This is taken into account in the model. In the light of high energy prices and thus growing costs for individual mobility, we foresee a market for dedicated small commuter vehicles. These cars would serve predominantly for the transport of a single person, reflecting today's car usage in industrialised countries. Although there will still be seats for three to five people, the comfort for the car passengers will be less. Therefore the `small' passenger vehicle of the future is projected to be smaller than it is today and therefore less energy intensive88.
Due to the differences in income level between the world's regions, which we have assumed to be still valid in 2050, the reference target vehicles are applied to new vehicle sales in the year 2050 for today's most industrialised regions: OECD Europe, North America and OECD Pacific. For all other regions, they are envisaged to enter the market in 2060, ten years later, and 20 years later in Africa.

gasoline and diesel cars

For traditional internal combustion engines, we have only allowed here for improvements in starting and stopping and no other hybrid features. Other vehicle adaptations to be introduced up to 2050 are described in more detail below.

For the small car sector we project a 1.8 litre/100 km (NEDC) fourseater diesel vehicle, as described in simulations by Friedrich89. We found corresponding results from our own simulations for a low-energy concept car with space for three adults and two children. For gasoline, we project 2.4 l/100 km. For the medium size sector, we project the potential for a 50% reduction in CO2 for gasoline cars and 42% for diesel cars. Approximately half of these reductions will be derived from power train improvements (including starting and stopping) and half from an improvement in energy demand. Aerodynamics, rolling resistance and lightweight design will contribute as described below.

For the large size sector, a slightly higher 60% emissions reduction

is predicted, resulting from higher mass reduction and greater

downsizing potentials (due to current over-motorisation). In

addition, we have assumed political measures have been introduced,

such as luxury taxes, in addition to high fuel costs, to reduce the

sales of very large SUVs (Sport Utility Vehicles) for passenger

transport. This means that the size of vehicles within the segment

will also decrease over the years. Examples of future cross-over

SUVs are projected, for example by Lovins and Cramer90.

12

Although considerable improvements are in sight for conventional gasoline and diesel engines without hybridisation, they will be technically hard to reach. Significant CO2 reductions in the short to medium term will therefore be much easier and cheaper to achieve with the hybridisation of power trains.

N

hybrid vehicles
Hybrid drive trains consist of at least two different energy converters and two energy storage units. The most common is the hybrid-electric drive train, although there are also proposals for kinetic and hydraulic hybrids. Advantages of the combination of the internal combustion engine with a second source of power arise from avoiding inefficient working regimes of the internal combustion engine (ICE), recuperation of braking energy, engine displacement downsizing and automated gear switch. For hybrid-electric vehicles, there are several different architectures and levels of hybridisation proposed.
Hybrid vehicles have been available since the 1990s. In 2006, approximately 400,000 hybrid cars were sold, which is less than 1% of world car production. An increasing number of hybrid models are being announced, however. For this study we have used reference values of 491, 4.592, 8.393 lge/100 km respectively for small, medium and large gasoline vehicles94.
For the reference target vehicles in 2050, we have projected the following values, depending on the vehicle segment.
small segment: As explained above, the small segment vehicles will be of the `1 litre car' type - smaller and lighter than today. A dedicated vehicle in the 500 kg class, with three seats and with a highly efficient propulsion system, will be standard by 2050, especially for commuting or other journeys were no multi-purpose
12 family type vehicle is necessary. The fuel consumption for this type of
vehicle is projected to be 1.6 lge/100 km.
medium segment: We developed our vision of reaching 60 g CO2 per km for the medium segment following the technological building blocks described below, although this might not be the only way to reach the target.
· A 25% emissions reduction is envisaged by using turbo charging with variable turbine geometry, external cooled exhaust gas recirculation, gasoline direct injection (2nd generation) and variable valve control/cam phase shifting with respective scavenging strategies. These measures all result in a downsizing and down speeding of the engine95.
· An additional potential for a 25% saving, related to the previous step, will come from hybridisation and the benefits in terms of start/stop improvements, regenerative braking and further downsizing. Waste heat recovery by thermoelectric generators will contribute to the onboard power supply, which saves an additional 3 to 5%96 97.
· A reduction in the vehicle's mass from 360 kg to 1,000 kg will reduce energy demand by about 18%98.To achieve lightweight construction, methods such as topology optimisation, multi-material design and highly integrated components will be used. Mass reductions of 60 to 120 kg for midsized cars have already been achieved99.The production and recycling processes of lightweight materials such as magnesium and carbon fibres will also be improved in 30-40 years time, thus avoiding a shift in emissions from the utilisation to the production phase.
· Aerodynamic resistance, aerodynamic drag and frontal areas offer further potential for improvements. By optimising the car's underside, engine air flows and contours we project an additional lowering of energy demand by 8%.
178

· Rolling resistance depends on the material used for the tyre, the construction of the tyre and its radius, tyre pressures and driving speed. The tyre industry has proposed new concepts for wheels which are intended to lower rolling resistance by 50% by 2030100 . 101 Reducing the rolling coefficient by 1/1000 will lead to fuel savings of 0.08 l/100 km102.This results in an additional 12% CO2 savings.
· Further potentials for energy savings will come from `intelligent controllers' which improve energy management and drive train control strategies by recognising frequently driven journeys. Improved traffic management to help a driver find the energy optimised route might also make a contribution. Other options for hybridisation could come from free piston linear generators, which produce electricity with a constant high efficiency, at the same time avoiding part load conditions because of the variable cylinder capacity103.
From the technologies and potentials described here, we project that within the next 40 years an improvement of 64% in energy consumption for hybrid vehicles is achievable, resulting in 2.6 l/100 km or 60 g CO2/km for a middle sized car in the NEDC test cycle. This corresponds to an annual improvement of 2.2%. It is likely that other combinations will lead to similar results, for example by following full hybridisation first, with a potential saving of 44%104[26] and adding complementary measures. We have also applied an 18% increase in fuel consumption based on a realistic assessment of driving patterns. The Volkswagen Golf V FSI 1.6 l, with a 1,360 kg mass and 163 g CO2/km in NEDC was used as a starting point105.
large segment: For large vehicles, the same technologies as described for the medium segment can be applied. We believe, however, that the potential for improvements is higher and project fuel consumption in 2050 at 3.5 lge/100 km. In addition, we assume that political measures to reduce the sales of very large SUVs for passenger transport have been introduced, so that the size of vehicles within the segment will also decrease.
 vehicles
Battery electric vehicles already have a long history, starting in 1881 with the first electric vehicle powered by a secondary Planté battery106. Considerable activity in the 1990s resulted in a number of production scale electric cars such as the EV1 (GM), Saxo electrique (Citroen), Hijet EV (Daihatsu), Th!nk City (Ford), EV Plus (Honda), Altra EV (Nissan), Clio Electric (Renault) and the RAV 4 (Toyota). At the beginning of the 21st century the Tesla Roadster is among the most prominent. There is also a continuous flow of prototype electric cars, including the Ion (Peugeot), E1 (BMW), A-Class electric (DaimlerChysler) and E-com (Toyota).
Battery electric vehicles are already very efficient. A fuel consumption of 1.7 litres gasoline equivalent /100 km is reported for the Ford e-Ka107, 2.1 l/100 km for the Ford Ecostar and 3.4 l/100 km for the Chrysler van108. In the future we anticipate reference target values of 0.7 l/100 km for small size cars based on simulations for micro cars and 1.4 l/100 km for medium size vehicles based on simulations of city and compact class vehicles. We do not consider battery vehicles for the large vehicle segment.
There is a considerable gap between test cycle results and real driving experience because of auxiliary power needs, for example for heating, cooling and other electrical services. We have therefore applied a factor of 1.7 to the transfer from test cycle to real world driving based on simulation results.
Battery electric vehicles carry their energy along on board in a chemical form. The future battery technology for vehicles will most probably be based on Lithium because of good energy densities and cost prospects. Remaining issues associated with the application of batteries in vehicles are safety, long term durability and costs. However, under the most optimistic estimates for battery development, battery electric vehicles will mainly be small vehicles and those with dedicated usage profiles like urban fleets. Other problems to be solved are fast recharging and cycle stability. Technical solutions have already been proposed, and the cost reduction target for batteries in the long term is to reach 1/40th of today's figures. An enormous amount of research is being carried out, as well as production of the first vehicle-type batteries. This scenario assumes the introduction of battery electric vehicles from 2015.


plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles

Plug-in-hybrids are a combination of conventional hybrids and battery electric vehicles. They promise to provide both advantages: using low carbon and cheap energy from the grid, a wide travel range and grid independent driving when necessary. Plug-in-hybrids can be adapted from conventional hybrids by changing to a higher capacity battery, but different concepts, so-called series hybrids, are also proposed. Again, depending on the control strategy, different concepts are possible. The ICE, for example, is designed as a rangeextender to recharge the battery only or a battery plus ICE/generator provides energy, depending on the power need. Fuel and energy consumption depend very much on the system layout and control strategy, combined with the distance, frequency and speed driven. We project 2.3, 2.4, 4.5 lge/100 km following the announced specification for the Volvo Recharge concept car and other input109.

By the year 2050 we project that plug-in hybrids will use 10% more

energy in electric mode compared to our projection for battery

electric vehicles due to their increased weight. Once the battery is

below the recharge limit, the ICE/generator will provide the energy

in part or full. In this operating mode we again project 10% higher

fuel consumption than their conventional hybrid counterparts. In

terms of CO2 balance the distribution of kilometres driven in electric

and ICE modes is crucial. We anticipate that 80% of all kilometres

will be driven in electric mode. In this scenario the introduction of

plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles starts in 2015.

fuel cell hydrogen
Fuel cell vehicles have reached a high level of readiness for mass production. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell provides high power density, resulting in low weight, cost and volume . Average drive cycle efficiencies have reached 3.5 lge/100 km111. Major problems still to be solved are durability, operating temperature range and cost reductions. Hydrogen on-board storage to provide a large driving range is a further issue not finally solved. Nevertheless, the technology seems ready to begin the transition into the mass market.
The main problem in fact is not so much the vehicles themselves as the hydrogen they need. Before the vehicles can operate, a hydrogen infrastructure needs to be established. The investment involved is risky, not least because of the competing electric systems. Because of energy losses in the hydrogen production chain, electricity appears to be cheaper, easier to handle and more environmentally friendly ­ at least until there is renewable electricity in abundance.
The hydrogen fuel cell vehicle might find its niche, however, where the driving range of battery electric vehicles is too low and/or locally emission free driving is demanded or the freedom from grid-connecting is valued more highly. We have projected a 35% improvement compared to today's fuel cell vehicles as the target reference value because of the potential for both fuel cell system improvement and lightweight, rolling resistance and aerodynamic vehicles, as already described.

projection of future vehicle technology mix We are convinced that the share of hybrid cars will grow enormously. For the industrialised regions, we anticipate a sales share of 65% for hybrid power trains by 2050 and for all other regions 50%, apart from Africa, with 25%. This share includes all types of non-grid connected hybrids. In 2050 the balance of different hybrids will be that in Europe, North America and OECD Pacific roughly 20% are powered by conventional ICE engines, roughly 40% are gridconnectable and 40% are autonomous hybrids. For all other regions, 34% will be conventional, a third plug-in-hybrids and a third autonomous hybrids. Africa is again treated differently.
To power all sizes of vehicles with the same technology does not make sense. We have therefore further projected that a large share of plugin-electric cars in the small vehicle segment (80%) will be battery electric vehicles. Two-thirds of the medium sized vehicles and all of the large vehicles will be plug-in-hybrids, thus still having an internal combustion engine on board.
projection of vehicle segment split
We have disaggregated the light duty vehicle sales into three segments: small, medium and large vehicles. This gives us the opportunity to show the effect of `driving smaller cars'. The size and CO2 emissions of the vehicles are particularly interesting in the light of the enormous growth predicted in the LDV stock. For our purposes we have divided up the numerous car types as follows. The small car bracket includes city, supermini, microvans, mini SUV, minicompact cars and two seaters. The medium sized bracket includes lower medium/subcompact, medium class and compact cars, car derived vans and small station wagons, upper medium class, midsize cars and station wagons, executive class, passenger vans (subcompact, compact and standard MPV), car derived pickups, subcompact and compact SUVs, 2WD and 4WD. Within the large car bracket we have included all kinds of luxury class, luxury MPV, medium and heavy vans, compact and full-size pickup trucks (2WD, 4WD), standard and luxury SUVs.
In examining the segment split, we have focused most strongly on the two world regions which will be the largest emitters of CO2 from cars in 2050: North America and China. In North America today the small vehicle segment is almost non-existant. We have nonetheless applied a considerable growth rate of 8% per year, triggered by rising fuel prices and possibly vehicle taxes. For China, we have anticipated the same share of the mature car market as for Europe and projected that the small segment will grow by 2.3% per year at the expenses of the larger segments in the light of rising mass mobility. The segment split is shown in Figure 12.5.


projection of switch to alternative fuels
A switch to renewable fuels in the car fleet is one of the cornerstones of our low CO2 car scenario, with the most prominent element the direct use of renewable electricity in cars. The different types of electric and hybrid cars, such as battery electric and plug-in-hybrid, are summarised as `plug-in electric'. Their introduction will start in industrialised countries in 2015, following an s-curve pattern, and are projected to reach about 40% of total LDV sales in the EU, North America and the Pacific OECD by 2050. Due to the higher costs of the technology and renewable electricity availability, we have slightly delayed progress in other countries. More cautious targets are applied for Africa. The sales split in vehicles by fuel is presented in Figure 12.7 for 2005 and 2050.

projection of global vehicle stock development
Differences in forecasts for the growth of vehicle sales in developing countries are huge112. We have mainly used the projections from the Reference Scenario. Slight changes were applied to vehicle sales in saturated markets such as Europe and North America, where we believe that massive policy intervention to promote modal shift and alternative forms of car usage will show effects in vehicle sales in the long run.

GLOBAL ENERGY [R]EVOLUTION A SUSTAINABLE GLOBAL ENERGY OUTLOOK

projection of kilometres driven per year
Until a complete shift from fossil to renewable fuels is completed, driving on the road will be linked to CO2 emissions. Thus driving less contributes to our target for emissions reduction. However this is not necessarily linked to less mobility because we have relied on the multitude of excellent opportunities for shifts from individual passenger road transport towards less CO2 intense public or nonmotorised transport.
In our scenario we have taken into account the effects of a variety of policy measures which could be implemented all over the world and summarised them in two indicators: numbers of vehicles (see the section above) and annual kilometres driven (AKD). For AKD we have applied a 0.25% reduction per year, assuming the first visible effect in 2010, resulting in a roughly 10% reduction by 2050. This has been coordinated into a model which projects the shift from car to rail or bus at 5%, with the additional 5% coming from LDVs as part of the predicted demand reduction for all modes of transport113.
Figure 12.9 shows the effect of vehicle travel reduction over time by world region. China shows a less typical pattern: while in China today many vehicles are used intensively, with many kilometres travelled per year, with a growing individual mobility we assume that AKD will move towards the global average.


summary of scenario results114
A combination of ambitious efforts to introduce higher efficiency vehicle technologies, a major switch to grid-connected electric vehicles and incentives for travellers to save CO2 all lead to the conclusion that it is possible to reduce emissions from well-to-wheel in 2050 by roughly 25%115 compared to 1990 and 40% compared to 2005. Even so, 74% of the final energy used in cars will still come from fossil fuel sources, 70% from gasoline and diesel. Renewable electricity covers 19% of total car energy demand, bio fuels cover 5% and hydrogen 2%. Energy consumption in total is reduced by 23% in 2050 compared to 2005, in spite of tremendous increases in some world regions. The peak in global CO2 emissions occurs between 2010 and 2015. From 2010 onwards, new legislation in the US and Europe contributes towards breaking the upwards trend in emissions. From 2020 onwards, we can see the effect of introducing gridconnected electric cars. The development of CO2 emissions, taking into account upstream emissions, is shown in Figure 12.8.
policy recommendations | TARGETS

At a time when governments around the world are in the process of liberalising their electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without political support, however, renewable energy remains at a disadvantage, marginalised by distortions in the world's electricity markets created by decades of massive financial, political and structural support to conventional technologies. Developing renewables will therefore require strong political and economic efforts, especially through laws which guarantee stable tariffs over a period of up to 20 years.
At present new renewable energy generators have to compete with old nuclear and fossil fuelled power stations which produce electricity at marginal costs because consumers and taxpayers have already paid the interest and depreciation on the original investments. Political action is needed to overcome these distortions and create a level playing field.
Renewable energy technologies would already be competitive if they had received the same attention as fossil fuels and nuclear in terms of R&D funding, subsidies, and if external costs were reflected in energy prices. Removing public subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear and applying the `polluter pays' principle to the energy markets, would go a long way to level the playing field and drastically reduce the need for renewables support. Unless this principle is fully implemented, renewable energy technologies need to receive compensation and additional support measures in order to compete in the distorted market.
13 Support mechanisms for the different sectors and technologies can
vary according to regional characteristics, priorities or starting points. But some general principles should apply to any kind of support mechanism. These criteria are:
effectiveness in reaching the targets The experiences in some countries show that it is possible with the right design of a support mechanism to reach agreed national targets. Any system to be adopted at a national level should focus on being effective in deploying new installed capacity and meeting the targets.
long term stability Whether price or quantity-based, policy makers need to make sure that investors can rely on the long-term stability of any support scheme. It is absolutely crucial to avoid stop-and-go markets by changing the system or the level of support frequently. Therefore market stability has to be created with a stable long-term support mechanism.
simple and fast administrative procedures Complex licensing procedures constitute one of the most difficult obstacles that renewables projects have to face. Administrative barriers have to be removed at all levels. A `one-stop-shop' system should be introduced and a clear timetable set for approving projects.

encouraging local and regional benefits and public acceptance The development of renewable technologies can have a significant impact on local and regional areas, resulting from both installation and manufacturing. Some support schemes include public involvements that hinder or facilitate the acceptance of renewable technologies. A support scheme should encourage local/regional development, employment and income generation. It should also encourage public acceptance of renewables, including their positive impact and increased stakeholder involvement.
The following is an overview of current political frameworks and barriers that need to be overcome in order to unlock renewable energy's great potential to become a major contributor to global energy supply. In the process it would also contribute to sustainable economic growth, high quality jobs, technology development, global competitiveness and industrial and research leadership.
renewable energy targets
In recent years, as part of their greenhouse gas reduction policies as well as for increasing security of energy supply, an increasing number of countries have established targets for renewable energy. These are either expressed in terms of installed capacity or as a percentage of energy consumption. Although these targets are not often legally binding, they have served as an important catalyst for increasing the share of renewable energy throughout the world, from Europe to the Far East to the USA.
A time horizon of just a few years is not long enough in the electricity sector, where the investment horizon can be up to 40 years. Renewable energy targets therefore need to have short, medium and long term steps and must be legally binding in order to be effective. They should also be supported by mechanisms such as the `feed-in tariff'. In order for the proportion of renewable energy to increase significantly, targets must be set in accordance with the local potential for each technology (wind, solar, biomass etc) and according to the local infrastructure, both existing and planned.
In recent years the wind and solar power industries have shown that it is possible to maintain a growth rate of 30 to 35% in the renewables sector. In conjunction with the European Photovoltaic Industry Association, the European Solar Thermal Power Industry Association and the European Wind Energy Association116, Greenpeace and EREC have documented the development of those industries from 1990 onwards and outlined a prognosis for growth up to 2020.

demands for the energy sector
Greenpeace and the renewables industry have a clear agenda for changes which need to be made in energy policy to encourage a shift to renewable sources. The main demands are:
· Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.
· Internalise the external costs (social and environmental) of energy production through `cap and trade' emissions trading.
· Mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming appliances, buildings and vehicles.
· Establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and combined heat and power generation.
· Reform the electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to the grid for renewable power generators.
· Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example through feed-in tariff programmes.
· Implement better labelling and disclosure mechanisms to provide more environmental product information.
· Increase research and development budgets for renewable energy and energy efficiency.
Conventional energy sources receive an estimated $250-300117 billion in subsidies per year worldwide, resulting in heavily distorted markets. Subsidies artificially reduce the price of power, keep renewable energy out of the market place and prop up noncompetitive technologies and fuels. Eliminating direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power would help move us towards a level playing field across the energy sector. The 2001 report of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force argued that ""readdressing them [subsidies] and making even a minor re-direction of these considerable financial flows toward renewables, provides an opportunity to bring consistency to new public goals and to include social and environmental costs in prices."" The Task Force recommended that ""G8 countries should take steps to remove incentives and other supports for environmentally harmful energy technologies, and develop and implement market-based mechanisms that address externalities, enabling renewable energy technologies to compete in the market on a more equal and fairer basis.""
Renewable energy would not need special provisions if markets were not distorted by the fact that it is still virtually free for electricity producers (as well as the energy sector as a whole) to pollute. Subsidies to fully mature and polluting technologies are highly unproductive. Removing subsidies from conventional electricity would not only save taxpayers' money. It would also dramatically reduce the need for renewable energy support.
This is a fuller description of what needs to be done to eliminate or compensate for current distortions in the energy market.
removal of energy market distortions A major barrier preventing renewable energy from reaching its full potential is the lack of pricing structures in the energy markets that reflect the full costs to society of producing energy. For more than a century, power generation was characterised by national monopolies with mandates to finance investments in new production capacity through state subsidies and/or levies on electricity bills. As many countries are moving in the direction of more liberalised electricity markets, these options are no longer available, which puts new generating technologies, such as wind power, at a competitive disadvantage relative to existing technologies. This situation requires a number of responses.

internalisation of the social and environmental costs of polluting energy The real cost of energy production by conventional energy includes expenses absorbed by society, such as health impacts and local and regional environmental degradation - from mercury pollution to acid rain ­ as well as the global negative impacts from climate change. Hidden costs include the waiving of nuclear accident insurance that is too expensive to be covered by the nuclear power plant operators. The Price Anderson Act, for instance, limits the liability of US nuclear power plants in the case of an accident to an amount of up to $ 98 million per plant, and only $15 million per year per plant, with the rest being drawn from an industry fund of up to $ 10 billion. After that the taxpayer becomes responsible118.

Environmental damage should, as a priority, be rectified at source.

Translated into energy generation that would mean that, ideally,

production of energy should not pollute and it is the energy

producers' responsibility to prevent it. If they do pollute they should pay an amount equal to the damage the production causes to

13

society as a whole. The environmental impacts of electricity

generation can be difficult to quantify, however. How do we put a

price on lost homes on Pacific Islands as a result of melting icecaps

or on deteriorating health and human lives?

policy recommendations | TARGETS

An ambitious project, funded by the European Commission - ExternE ­ has tried to quantify the true costs, including the environmental costs, of electricity generation. It estimates that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double and that from gas would increase by 30% if external costs, in the form of damage to the environment and health, were taken into account. If those environmental costs were levied on electricity generation according to their impact, many renewable energy sources would not need any support. If, at the same time, direct and indirect subsidies to fossil fuels and nuclear power were removed, the need to support renewable electricity generation would seriously diminish or cease to exist.

introduce the ""polluter pays"" principle As with the other subsidies, external costs must be factored into energy pricing if the market is to be truly competitive. This requires that governments apply a ""polluter pays"" system that charges the emitters accordingly, or applies suitable compensation to non-emitters. Adoption of polluter pays taxation to electricity sources, or equivalent compensation to renewable energy sources, and exclusion of renewables from environment-related energy taxation, is essential to achieve fairer competition in the world's electricity markets.

electricity market reform Renewable energy technologies could already be competitive if they had received the same attention as other sources in terms of R&D funding and subsidies, and if external costs were reflected in power prices. Essential reforms in the electricity sector are necessary if new renewable energy technologies are to be accepted on a larger scale. These reforms include:
removal of electricity sector barriers Complex licensing procedures and bureaucratic hurdles constitute one of the most difficult obstacles faced by renewable energy projects in many countries. A clear timetable for approving projects should be set for all administrations at all levels. Priority should be given to renewable energy projects. Governments should propose more detailed procedural guidelines to strengthen the existing legislation and at the same time streamline the licensing procedure for renewable energy projects.
A major barrier is the short to medium term surplus of electricity generating capacity in many OECD countries. Due to over-capacity it is still cheaper to burn more coal or gas in an existing power plant than to build, finance and depreciate a new renewable power plant. The effect is that, even in those situations where a new technology would be fully competitive with new coal or gas fired power plants, the investment will not be made. Until we reach a situation where electricity prices start reflecting the cost of investing in new capacity rather than the marginal cost of existing capacity, support for renewables will still be required to level the playing field.
Other barriers include the lack of long term planning at national,
13 regional and local level; lack of integrated resource planning; lack
of integrated grid planning and management; lack of predictability and stability in the markets; no legal framework for international bodies of water; grid ownership by vertically integrated companies and a lack of long-term R&D funding.
There is also a complete absence of grids for large scale renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind power or concentrating solar power (CSP) plants; weak or non-existant grids onshore; little recognition of the economic benefits of embedded/distributed generation; and discriminatory requirements from utilities for grid access that do not reflect the nature of the renewable technology.
The reforms needed to address market barriers to renewables include:
· Streamlined and uniform planning procedures and permitting systems and integrated least cost network planning.
· Fair access to the grid at fair, transparent prices and removal of discriminatory access and transmission tariffs.
· Fair and transparent pricing for power throughout a network, with recognition and remuneration for the benefits of embedded generation.
· Unbundling of utilities into separate generation and distribution companies.
· The costs of grid infrastructure development and reinforcement must be carried by the grid management authority rather than individual renewable energy projects.
· Disclosure of fuel mix and environmental impact to end users to enable consumers to make an informed choice of power source.

priority grid access Rules on grid access, transmission and cost sharing are very often inadequate. Legislation must be clear, especially concerning cost distribution and transmission fees. Renewable energy generators should be guaranteed priority access. Where necessary, grid extension or reinforcement costs should be borne by the grid operators, and shared between all consumers, because the environmental benefits of renewables are a public good and system operation is a natural monopoly.
support mechanisms for renewables The following section provides an overview of the existing support mechanisms and experiences of their operation. Support mechanisms remain a second best solution for correcting market failures in the electricity sector. However, introducing them is a practical political solution to acknowledge that, in the short term, there are no other practical ways to apply the polluter pays principle.
Overall, there are two types of incentive to promote deployment of renewable energy. These are Fixed Price Systems where the government dictates the electricity price (or premium) paid to the producer and lets the market determine the quantity, and Renewable Quota Systems (in the USA referred to as Renewable Portfolio Standards) where the government dictates the quantity of renewable electricity and leaves it to the market to determine the price. Both systems create a protected market against a background of subsidised, depreciated conventional generators whose external environmental costs are not accounted for. Their aim is to provide incentives for technology improvements and cost reductions, leading to cheaper renewables that can compete with conventional sources in the future.
The main difference between quota based and price based systems is that the former aims to introduce competition between electricity producers. However, competition between technology manufacturers, which is the most crucial factor in bringing down electricity production costs, is present regardless of whether government dictates prices or quantities. Prices paid to wind power producers are currently higher in many European quota based systems (UK, Belgium, Italy) than in fixed price or premium systems (Germany, Spain, Denmark).
· fixed price systems Fixed price systems include investment subsidies, fixed feed-in tariffs, fixed premium systems and tax credits.
Investment subsidies are capital payments usually made on the basis of the rated power (in kW) of the generator. It is generally acknowledged, however, that systems which base the amount of support on generator size rather than electricity output can lead to less efficient technology development. There is therefore a global trend away from these payments, although they can be effective when combined with other incentives.
Fixed feed-in tariffs (FITs), widely adopted in Europe, have proved extremely successful in expanding wind energy in Germany, Spain and Denmark. Operators are paid a fixed price for every kWh of electricity they feed into the grid. In Germany the price paid varies according to the relative maturity of the particular technology and reduces each year to reflect falling costs. The additional cost of the system is borne by taxpayers or electricity consumers.


The main benefit of a FIT is that it is administratively simple and encourages better planning. Although the FIT is not associated with a formal Power Purchase Agreement, distribution companies are usually obliged to purchase all the production from renewable installations. Germany has reduced the political risk of the system being changed by guaranteeing payments for 20 years. The main problem associated with a fixed price system is that it does not lend itself easily to adjustment ­ whether up or down - to reflect changes in the production costs of renewable technologies.
Fixed premium systems, sometimes called an ""environmental bonus"" mechanism, operate by adding a fixed premium to the basic wholesale electricity price. From an investor perspective, the total price received per kWh is less predictable than under a feed-in tariff because it depends on a constantly changing electricity price. From a market perspective, however, it is argued that a fixed premium is easier to integrate into the overall electricity market because those involved will be reacting to market price signals. Spain is the most prominent country to have adopted a fixed premium system.
Tax credits, as operated in the US and Canada, offer a credit against tax payments for every kWh produced. In the United States the market has been driven by a federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) of approximately 1.8 cents per kWh. It is adjusted annually for inflation.
· renewable quota systems Two types of renewable quota systems have been employed - tendering systems and green certificate systems.
Tendering systems involve competitive bidding for contracts to construct and operate a particular project, or a fixed quantity of renewable capacity in a country or state. Although other factors are usually taken into account, the lowest priced bid invariably wins. This system has been used to promote wind power in Ireland, France, the UK, Denmark and China.
The downside is that investors can bid an uneconomically low price in order to win the contract, and then not build the project. Under the UK's NFFO (Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation) tender system, for example, many contracts remained unused. It was eventually abandoned. If properly designed, however, with long contracts, a clear link to planning consent and a possible minimum price, tendering for large scale projects could be effective, as it has been for offshore oil and gas extraction in Europe's North Sea.

Tradable green certificate (TGC) systems operate by offering ""green certificates"" for every kWh generated by a renewable producer. The value of these certificates, which can be traded on a market, is then added to the value of the basic electricity. A green certificate system usually operates in combination with a rising quota of renewable electricity generation. Power companies are bound by law to purchase an increasing proportion of renewables input. Countries which have adopted this system include the UK, Sweden and Italy in Europe and many individual states in the US, where it is known as a Renewable Portfolio Standard.
Compared with a fixed tender price, the TGC model is more risky for the investor, because the price fluctuates on a daily basis, unless effective markets for long-term certificate (and electricity) contracts are developed. Such markets do not currently exist. The system is also more complex than other payment mechanisms.
Which one out of this range of incentive systems works best? Based on past experience it is clear that policies based on fixed tariffs and premiums can be designed to work effectively. However, introducing them is not a guarantee for success. Almost all countries with experience in mechanisms to support renewables have, at some point in time, used feed-in tariffs, but not all have contributed to an increase in renewable electricity production. It is the design of a mechanism, in combination with other measures, which determines its success.
renewables for heating and cooling Largely forgotten, but equally important, is the heating and cooling sector. In many
regions of the world, such as Europe, nearly half of the total energy 13
demand is for heating/cooling, a demand which can be addressed easily at competitive prices.
Policies should make sure that specific targets and appropriate measures for renewable heating and cooling are part of any national renewables strategy. These should foresee a coherent set of measures dedicated to the promotion of renewables for heating and cooling, including financial incentives, awareness raising campaigns, training of installers, architects and heating engineers, and demonstration projects. For new buildings, and those undergoing major renovation, an obligation to cover a minimum share of heat consumption by renewables should be introduced, as already implemented in some countries and regions.
Measures should stimulate the deployment of the large potential for cost effective renewable heating and cooling, available already with today's technologies. At the same time, increased R&D efforts should be undertaken, particularly in the fields of heat storage and renewable cooling.

The definition of different sectors is analog to the sectorial break down of the IEA World Energy Outlook series. All definitions below are from the IEA Key World Energy Statistics
Industry sector: Consumption in the industry sector includes the following subsectors (energy used for transport by industry is not included -> see under ""Transport"") · Iron and steel industry · Chemical industry · Non-metallic mineral products e.g. glass, ceramic, cement etc. · Transport equipment · Machinery · Mining · Food and tobacco · Paper, pulp and print · Wood and wood products (other than pulp and paper) · Construction · Textile and Leather
Transport sector: The Transport sector includes all fuels from transport such as road, railway, aviation, domestic and navigation. Fuel
used for ocean, costal and inland fishing is included in ""Other Sectors"". 14

`GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD NEED TO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS THAT REDUCE OUR CARBON EMISSIONS AND END OUR ADDICTION TO OIL.' Leila Deen, climate campaigner

CONFRONTING

Climate campaigner Leila Deen explains why she and 34 other Greenpeace activists sailed to the pristine Arctic to take direct action against the oil industry.

Drilling for oil beneath the Arctic seas is only possible between August and November, giving oil companies just four months each year to explore for oil. An oil spill in this remote and icy environment would be close to impossible to clean up. Yet this year, relatively unknown Scottish company, Cairn Energy ­ determined to discover the last drops of oil ­ aimed to drill at least two exploratory wells before the sea froze over for the winter.
PREVENTING AN OIL RUSH
We knew that if we could stop drilling ­ even for a short time ­ we could potentially ruin Cairn's chances of discovering oil and the Arctic would escape exploitation for another year. If the company struck oil, however, it would be an invitation for other oil companies to rush in, massively threatening this remote and delicate wilderness ­ home to blue whales, seals, sharks, kittiwakes and many other species. We had to confront them.
So in August, we sailed our ship the Esperanza to Greenland to take direct action. After nine days of circling the Stena Don oil rig and waiting for the right moment, we

saw our opportunity. We outmaneuvered Cairn's security and climbed onto the underside of the rig, successfully surviving the severe Arctic conditions and shutting down drilling operations for 40 hours. Days later, tired but exuberant, we heard that Cairn had failed, they had not struck oil. The Arctic was safe from oil drilling for now.
But the only way to truly protect the Arctic and other remote locations from exploitation is to reduce our dependence on oil. The society we live in today relies on energy which for many people is synonymous with oil. But that simply is not true any more ­ we have a choice. We either let oil companies lock us in to increased carbon emissions and environmental damage or we go beyond oil to a clean energy future. I know which future I want.

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
Greenpeace is working internationally to confront oil companies and governments that have plans for Arctic oil developments in Alaska, Russia and Greenland.
Reducing our demand for oil is key to preventing oil companies from taking ever increasing risks to feed the world's addiction to oil. In Europe, we will be publicly confronting car companies that are lobbying against legislation on car emissions and pressuring them to make cars more efficient and help set us on the path to go beyond oil.

EXPOSING

`NESTLÉ HAD TWO WEAK SPOTS: A MUCH-LOVED BRAND AND INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF ITS SUPPLY CHAIN.' The Economist

Forest campaigner Ian Duff explains how we convinced Nestlé to stop destroying rainforests and publicly commit to a progressive plan to protect forests.

Greenpeace's two-year investigation revealed that Sinar Mas ­ a company known for appalling environmental and social practices ­ was clearing rainforests and draining carbon rich peatlands to create palm oil plantations. The company was violating people's land rights, destroying habitats, pushing endangered orangutans closer to extinction and releasing huge quantities of greenhouse gases every year.
PARTNERS IN CRIME
We traced the Sinar Mas supply chain directly to Nestlé and our investigations quickly transformed into a high-profile exposé. As we launched our report `Caught Red Handed', activists presented our findings at Nestlé headquarters and offices around the world, demanding that Nestlé stop destroying forests for palm oil.
Meanwhile, over 1.5 million people around the world watched our spoof KitKat advert and Greenpeace supporters triggered an onslaught the company had never encountered before, with over 200,000 emails and hundreds of phonecalls.

SWEET SUCCESS!
Nestlé ­ a company notorious for not giving in to consumer pressure ­ agreed to all our demands within eight weeks. It cancelled its contracts with Sinar Mas and introduced a policy excluding companies linked to deforestation from its entire supply chain. It enlisted an independent NGO, The Forest Trust, to help implement the new policy.
CHAIN REACTION
Spurred on by success, we turned our attention to HSBC. Following subverted adverts threatening their brand and nearly 10,000 emails from Greenpeace supporters, HSBC announced it had sold its shares in Sinar Mas. Clearly feeling the threat of exposure, companies including Burger King, Mars, Marks & Spencer, Kraft, Sainsbury's, Shell and many more have since committed not to buy Sinar Mas palm oil, putting more pressure on them to stop rainforest destruction.

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
Already in 2011, Sinar Mas has committed to stop destroying forests and peatlands for palm oil as a result of our campaign. We will be making sure this policy is implemented and investigating how Indonesia's pulp and paper market ­ also dominated by Sinar Mas ­ continues to destroy rainforests. Only by convincing companies in Europe, the USA and China to cancel contracts can we reach our goal of zero deforestation in Indonesia's unique and biodiverse rainforests.


INFLUENCING

In May, the new government rejected plans for a third runway at Heathrow. Anna Jones from the climate team describes how Airplot became the climate victory story for 2010.

Airplot was an incredible campaign to be involved with. Not just because we won, but because this small piece of land, slap bang in the middle of Heathrow's planned third runway, became the focus of such a vibrant and powerful climate movement. Over 91,000 people signed up to become beneficial owners of the airplot, showing just how strong opposition to airport expansion is in the UK.
PLANTING THE SEED
Our work in the run up to the general election was central to Airplot's success. Greenpeace campaigners, supporters and plot owners worked hard to ensure that by the time the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties came to power, they were firmly opposed to the runway. As more people signed up to become Airplotters, we persuaded David Cameron and Nick Clegg to have trees planted in their name

in the airplot orchard, as a commitment to stopping Heathrow expansion. Nick Clegg even came along to plant his own tree. This ongoing and growing reminder of their opposition to airport expansion made a post-election change of heart very difficult.
Airplot was part of a strong coalition against airport expansion. In April, a month before the election, Greenpeace and twelve other groups including local councils, other NGOs and residents' groups took the Labour government to court ­ and won. The judge ruled that the government's aviation policy was inconsistent with its own Climate Change Act and that the economic case for the runway expansion plan was flawed. This major victory ­ the first test of the Climate Change Act ­ means that any incoming government now knows that all new policies must take climate change into account.

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
Stopping aviation expansion goes hand in hand with developing a truly sustainable transport policy. We will be challenging the government, oil industry and car and transport sectors to go beyond oil. We need to build a clean energy future for the UK, instead of chasing the last drops of oil to feed an unsustainable transport system.

`LONG TERM ENERGY SECURITY MUST COME FROM LOWERING OIL DEMAND, NOT SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL IN FRAGILE HABITATS AND TREACHEROUS SEAS.' John Sauven, executive director

INTERVENING

Vicky Wyatt from the climate team tells us why Greenpeace has taken legal action to stop the government from issuing oil companies with new drilling licences in UK waters.

In April 2010, BP's disaster in the Gulf of Mexico brought to the world's attention the huge risks that the oil industry is willing to take to pursue the last drops of oil. However, before we could truly learn from the mistakes made in the Gulf, by September the UK government had granted energy company Chevron the go-ahead to drill for oil in the deep ocean to the west of the Shetland Islands.
The area is home to protected bird species as well as whales, dolphins and ancient sea corals. All of these would be devastated by a major spill.

We are taking the government to court because it cannot legally grant new oil licences without understanding the causes of the explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, without assessing the risks of it happening again and without properly assessing the impacts a spill could have on wildlife. To do so is reckless and irresponsible.
Chevron itself admitted that drilling in these waters could result in a spill worse than BP's. It also released an environmental statement claiming that marine animals' `good swimming abilities' would enable them to avoid the polluted waters of an oil spill. The government should have challenged such absurd statements, which is why we took action to intervene.

GOOD TRACK RECORD
We have defeated the government in court before and our lawyers are confident that the evidence we have prepared is strong enough to secure another victory. Our case is simple: granting licenses without carrying out a proper assessment is illegal.
WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
The High Court has given Greenpeace permission to proceed with our Judicial Review in 2011­ a date for the hearing will be fixed in the near future. If the High Court upholds our challenge, the government will be unable to grant licences for deep sea drilling without a thorough environmental assessment of the risks to protected areas and species.

`IT'S CALLED A SUPPLY CHAIN FOR A REASON: THERE ARE A LOT OF LINKS ­ RANCHERS, SLAUGHTERHOUSES, TANNERIES... GREENPEACE EFFECTIVELY BROUGHT A COALITION OF PRESSURE AGAINST EVERY LINK IN THE CHAIN SIMULTANEOUSLY.' Jeff Swarz, President and CEO of Timberland

TRANSFORMING

Paulo Adario leads our forest campaign in the Amazon. Here he updates us on how, thanks to Greenpeace's determined and longstanding work, deforestation is lower than any other time on record.

It is such a pleasure to be able to report great news directly to our supporters from here in the Amazon ­ according to Brazilian Environmental Agency statistics, forest destruction is down to its lowest level since satellite monitoring began in 1988. And it is without a doubt that Greenpeace's continuous presence here for the past 15 years has been crucial to this success. But even with this great achievement, nearly 7,000km2 of forest was destroyed between 2009 and 2010 and this is still too much.
HOW TO PROTECT A FOREST
This amazingly biodiverse area covers five percent of the Earth's surface and is vital for regulating the world's climate. But it is partly the size of the region that has made it so difficult to protect. A lack of monitoring had made it easy for industry to ignore Brazil's forest protection laws, expanding its farms and profiting from forest destruction.
Greenpeace's work has transformed the region. Building on previous work in countries like the UK that use soya and leather products, in 2010, we worked in four main areas crucial to stopping deforestation:

g Working with local communities: We helped develop land use maps and pressured farmers to register their land to enable reliable monitoring of deforestation.
g Field investigations: We documented and reported farmers who were ignoring agreements and continuing to destroy the Amazon for cattle ranching and soya.
g Political lobbying: Over 90,000 Greenpeace supporters emailed the Brazilian government to demand that it upholds its forest protection laws.
g Working with industry: We formed beef and leather working groups, with companies, local government and NGOs to develop forest protection strategies.
These are all positive steps towards our ultimate goal of zero deforestation. As a direct result of our work, more and more companies and consumers want to know the products they buy are not causing forest destruction. Soya and cattle companies working in the Amazon must now prove they are not destroying forests or they will lose their customers.

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
The Amazon is still under threat. During 2011 we must continue to work with politicians and companies to ensure that forest protection laws are strengthened and work within the rainforest to expose the culprits who are driving deforestation.
The soya sector is under control for now, but the cattle industry is still the biggest offender. We will continue to hold companies that buy Amazonian products to their word, making sure they can prove they are not linked to deforestation.
INVESTIGATING

Toxic chemicals from industry are making nearly half of China's water unsafe for human contact. Yifang Li, based in our Beijing office, explains why this is a global problem.

Water pollution is one of China's most severe environmental problems ­ one in four people here drink unsafe water. Toxic chemicals, many of which are banned in the EU and other countries, are still used for manufacturing in China and contribute significantly to this pollution. A major culprit is our growing textile industry. Clothing is one of China's leading exports and global demand for cheap clothes is driving this damage.
Greenpeace launched an investigation into the use and effect of toxic chemicals in two manufacturing towns: Xintang, the `Jeans Capital of the World' and Gurao, where underwear and clothing manufacturing makes up 80 percent of its economy. We sent water and sediment from local rivers for independent analysis and found toxic metals in 17 out of the 21 samples. Cadmium, one of the metals found, exceeded China's national limits by 128 times in one sample. The results of these investigations were released in our special report, `Intimate Pollution'.

IMMEDIATE IMPACT
Greenpeace is the only NGO working to uncover and document evidence linking clothing manufacturing to water pollution and our findings caused uproar in both the Chinese and international media. As a direct result of China's national television coverage of the story, Xintang's local government publicly committed to `zero tolerance', meaning tighter regulations and an investigation into polluting factories.
Greenpeace's work has forced one local government to take some initial progressive steps, but as China's industry and exports increase rapidly, so does water contamination with its severe ecological impacts and threat to human life. We still have a long way to go.
As we are not able to fundraise here in mainland China, our progress so far has only been possible because of generous donations from supporters in Europe and the USA. Thank you.

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
Water pollution in China, driven by the West's demand for cheap goods is a serious global problem. In 2011, we will be investigating links between high street brands across the world and pollution in China's Pearl and Yangtze rivers. We need to make sure retailers become accountable for their supply chains.
LOBBYING

Good news! Areas of the Indian and Pacific oceans are now protected from the fishing industry. Willie Mackenzie from the oceans team tells us why this is such a positive step.

Most of the tuna eaten in Europe comes from the Indian and Pacific oceans where destructive fishing is widespread. Yet when picking up a sandwich or a tin of tuna most people do not see the true cost of fishing.
Fishing fleets from places as far away as the EU, Japan and China chase tuna fish in these tropical waters, but indiscriminate fishing methods do not just catch tuna. Other species like sharks and turtles, caught as unwanted bycatch, are thrown back into the ocean either dead or dying. Overfishing and illegal fishing are also rampant and the surrounding nations reap very little financial reward for this plundering of their seas.
Greenpeace has been actively working in the Pacific for many years now, both at sea onboard our ships, and on land helping Pacific Islanders get a fair deal for their fish. We have been lobbying for the creation of large scale marine reserves ­ areas at sea where important marine life and fish populations are protected and destructive fishing is banned.

PACIFIC PROGRESS
This year our work paid off and eight Pacific Island nations agreed to protect an area of ocean the size of India from destructive fishing. All eight nations have agreed to decrease their own fishing efforts by thirty percent and ban fisheries that use purse seine nets ­ a particularly damaging fishing method ­ to protect dwindling populations of yellowfin and bigeye tuna.
MORE GOOD NEWS
And there was more success in the Indian ocean. In the largest ocean conservation move ever, the UK government created the world's largest fully protected marine reserve in the waters around the Chagos Archipelago. This unique area is twice the size of the UK, home to over 200 species of coral and marine life including whale sharks, turtles, clownfish, and is as important to biodiversity as the Great Barrier Reef.

17

WHAT NEXT FOR 2011?
Already in 2011 we have had a major victory as supermarket Tesco and tuna brand Princes committed to completely clean up their fishing method policies. As the year continues, we will be working with retailers around the world to make sure they support protection of the Pacific Commons and the creation of marine reserves. Retailers and suppliers must demand to know how their fish is caught and end the market for fish caught by destructive methods.
Forest protection was our theme at the 40th Glastonbury festival in 2010. Our mock HSBC cashpoints around the site exposed the bank's links to rainforest destruction to thousands of festival goers. In our very own Greenpeace field we featured a forest friendly, FSC-certified skate ramp, a giant tree-shaped climbing wall and rainforest themed solar-powered showers, which generated a seemingly endless queue of festival goers keen to stay clean. All of this is only made possible by the hundreds of volunteers who help us each year.
Glastonbury has played an important role in Greenpeace's work since the early nineties. The festival's founder, Michael Eavis, is one of our most generous financial supporters, and helps us to connect with the thousands of people who enjoy the festival every year. The festival is also watched around the world, so our vision for a green and peaceful world goes out to a global audience.

Helping to bring the festival to life for many people who could not attend, was one of Britain's leading artists and long-time Greenpeace supporter Kurt Jackson. Kurt donated his amazing series of paintings and sketches of scenes around the festival to Greenpeace, we exhibited them in an open gallery on London's South Bank, and then raised an incredible £68,000 at our auction.
These generous donations, along with every other donation we receive, turn our campaigns from ideas into actions.

Prepared For Natural Resources Defense Council
FINAL REPORT May 2008

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
During recent years, there has been considerable discussion in public policy circles about the costs of recycling vis-à-vis out-of-state export of New York City's trash. While the environmental and natural resource benefits of recycling have long been widely acknowledged, proposed cuts to the city's recycling budget in 2002 raised questions both in New York and around the nation as to whether recycling was a cost-effective strategy for dealing with municipal solid waste. Even after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the New York City Council agreed to restore glass and plastic recycling collections for all households in 2004, and to enter into a long-term contract for the sorting and reselling of collected recyclables, some economic questions lingered.
In late 2004, DSM Environmental Services, Inc. (""DSM""), a consulting firm with specific expertise in economic analysis of solid waste and municipal services, was commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (""NRDC"") to undertake a study of the economics of recycling in New York City. To our knowledge, this is the first independent review of the City's cost allocation model by a recognized expert in recycling economics.
The primary purpose of this study was to analyze the City's present and future recycling costs, focusing specifically on a comparison of curbside collection for recycling versus curbside waste collection for export to out-of-state landfills and incinerators. This study effort also sought to assist policy makers in creating a more transparent system for calculating the costs of recycling.
Over the past three years, DSM has exhaustively analyzed the Department of Sanitation (""DSNY"") data and conducted dozens of interviews with key personnel from DSNY, as well as from the city's Economic Development Corporation, Independent Budget Office and City Comptroller's Office. We greatly appreciate their cooperation and invaluable assistance. However, the conclusions in this report are solely those of DSM.
Here are the major findings and conclusion of our analysis of the economics of New York City's recycling program.
 The citywide costs per ton of curbside collection and disposal of recyclables in fiscal year 2005 (the most recent year for which complete data were available) were very close to the costs per ton of curbside collection and disposal of non-recycled refuse. Specifically, we concluded that the overall FY '05 cost per ton of curbside recycling was $284 dollars per ton vs. $267 per ton for curbside refuse, representing a difference of roughly six percent. (See pages 19-20.)
 This is a relatively insignificant difference given the type of accounting method utilized by DSNY to allocate large shared refuse and recycling costs. (See page 3-4, 19.)
 The primary reason for the slightly higher per ton citywide cost for curbside recycling in FY `05 is simply that recycling collection crews collected fewer tons per shift than refuse collection crews. (See page 20.)
 Indeed, the overall cost of processing ­ as opposed to collection ­ a ton of the city's recyclables is currently significantly less than the cost the city must pay companies to bury or burn a ton of the city's regular trash.
 Further, City-wide average curbside costs of paper recycling are already less costly than average, City-wide curbside costs of refuse. (See page 21.)
 Looking to the future, DSNY has reported to the City Council that they expect export costs for curbside collected refuse will be $107 in FY 09 and $124 in FY 14. At $124/ton for export,
 i

curbside collection of both paper and MGP recyclables would have been less expensive than curbside collection of refuse for export in 2005. We recognize that factors such as increasing fuel, labor, and equipment costs will negatively impact the cost of both recycling and refuse collection looking forward, and that it is difficult to predict what total system costs will be in future years. However, we believe that there will be continued upward pressure on export costs for refuse, and the potential to further reduce recycling costs as more material is collected and world-wide recycling markets continue to demand more secondary material. (See page 22.)
 In light of these trends, we conclude that the City's curbside collection program for paper and metal, glass and plastic will begin to reduce overall DSNY system costs within the near future ­ at least within the next five to six fiscal years. In the interim, the difference between curbside recycling and refuse costs will be relatively minor, and will continue to decline as more residents participate in the recycling collection program. (See page 25.)
 A key to making citywide curbside recycling overall less costly to the City than curbside refuse collection and disposal is to make recycling collections as efficient as possible. Therefore, DSNY should continue in its strategy to reduce overall system costs by focusing on increasing set-outs of recyclables by NYC households. (See pages 5 and 23.)
 Our analysis is based upon a review of, and adjustment to, DSNY's current cost allocation model. The current model must be adjusted to accurately compare curbside recycling costs with curbside refuse costs. This is because the current DSNY model lumps all ""recycling"" costs together ­ ranging from composting at Rikers Island to Freon removal to waste prevention activities ­ while simultaneously allocating some snow and ice removal costs to refuse and recycling. Therefore, we strongly recommend that these revisions to DSNY cost allocation model be adopted for future use by DSNY and others seeking to understand the economics of the City's curbside recycling program. (See page 11­13.)
 Finally, this analysis focused solely on an economic comparison of curbside recycling and refuse. It is important to underscore that an economic comparison does not fully account for the environmental impacts of the City's waste disposal system. For example, using EPA's Waste Reduction Model, which helps assess greenhouse gas emissions from different waste management practices, it is estimated that carbon emissions reductions from the City's recycling program have been dramatic, representing over 500,000 metric tons carbon equivalent savings in FY '05 alone. This is especially critical given that transportation (including export of refuse) and landfilling are two of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and given the City's vulnerability to the impacts of global warming. (See Appendix A.)

SECTION I. INTRODUCTION
Beginning in 1994, the New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) has annually compared the per ton cost of recycling and the per ton cost of refuse collection and disposal using a total cost allocation model which allocates all DSNY costs among DSNY's cleaning and collection activities.1 This cost allocation model has consistently shown per ton recycling costs to be higher than per ton refuse collection and disposal costs. For FY 05, the most recent year for which the cost allocation has been completed, DSNY calculated fully allocated refuse collection and disposal costs at $263 per ton and recycling collection costs at $343 per ton.
In June, 2002 higher bids to process metal, glass and plastic (MGP), combined with a fiscal crisis post 9/11 pushed the Bloomberg Administration to recommend elimination of MGP curbside recycling collection.2 The final FY 03 budget, negotiated with the City Council, eliminated glass and plastic but left in metal curbside collection. Projected differences in curbside recycling collection costs when compared to curbside refuse collection costs were used, in part, to project savings associated with the elimination of glass and plastic collection. However, after one year, savings that had been projected were not realized. Simultaneously, DSNY received a proposal from the Hugo Neu Corporation (now part of the Sims Group) to process metal, glass and plastic (MGP) at a reduced rate compared to previous processing bids. This was among the factors that led the City to reintroduce plastic collection in July 2003, and glass in April 2004.3
Because DSNY's cost allocation model continues to show that City-wide average per ton costs for recyclables are greater than City-wide average per ton costs for collection and disposal of refuse,4 recycling supporters have been concerned that the issue of elimination of the curbside recycling program might be raised again in the future. Some recycling proponents have questioned whether the DSNY model unfairly allocates costs to recycling compared to refuse, thus biasing the results of the City's calculations.
As a result, a number of efforts have been made to review and analyze the DSNY model. These include analyses by NYPIRG, the New York City Comptrollers Office, and, most recently (FY 02 and FY 06), New York City's Independent Budget Office (IBO).
NRDC, a long-time advocate of recycling, thought that it would make sense to identify a firm that could conduct an independent, expert analysis of the DSNY cost allocation model to determine if the cost allocation model was an appropriate methodology for allocating DSNY's costs, and whether it accurately and fairly allocated costs for recycling and refuse collection. DSM Environmental Services, Inc. (DSM), a firm specializing in economic analysis of recycling systems, was retained to conduct this analysis.5
1 As discussed in detail below, DSNY lumps all activities related to ""recycling"" (e.g., composting at Rikers Island, Freon removal from appliances, waste prevention activities) together for the purpose of this analysis. 2 Contracts to process MGP came up for re-bid in June 2002. Processors bid between $95 and $165 per ton making processing costs higher than export costs for refuse. 3 Processing and Marketing of Recyclables in New York City, Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling, May 2004, p. 75. 4 It should be noted that the Independent Budget Office concluded that in FY 02, average costs for paper recycling only were less than refuse collection, and we reach the same conclusion in FY 05. See also page 21. 5 DSM Environmental Services, Inc. has twenty years of experience conducting economic analysis of solid waste and recycling systems. Clients include State governments (Vermont, Massachusetts, Delaware and Rhode Island); solid waste authorities (Delaware Solid Waste Authority, Solid Waste Authority of Central Ohio, Aquidneck Island Planning Commission, East Central Iowa Council of Governments); Cities (e.g., Boston, Cambridge, New York, Wilmington, Columbus, Johannesburg, SA; and international agencies (US AID, United Nations, World Bank, South African Development Bank).

In December, 2004 NRDC arranged for a joint meeting with the New York City Economic Development Commission and DSNY to request access to the DSNY model and DSNY staff who run the model. DSNY agreed to provide DSM with complete access, and provided DSM with the FY 04 model to begin the analysis. The only limitation that DSNY placed on DSM was that the analysis concentrate on the cost allocation model, and not on collection efficiency or other labor productivity issues. A draft report was released by DSM to DSNY and NYEDC in January 2006. Comments were received from DSNY in early 2006 in preparation for release of a final report. However during the review of the draft report it was agreed by all parties that the FY 05 model would be more representative of the real cost of recycling because it was the first full year after reintroduction of glass and plastic curbside recycling.6 DSM began a review of the FY 05 model in May 2006 with an agreement that DSNY would incorporate mutually agreed upon changes to the FY 05 cost allocation model proposed by DSM. DSM received the revised model incorporating these changes in September, and subsequently worked to make additional revisions and clarifications to the model. This report presents the result of this three year effort of DSM to evaluate the DSNY model.
6 Lorenzo Cipollina, Deputy Commissioner, Charles Stamm, Deputy Director, Planning and Budget, and Barbara Rothenberg, Deputy Director, Operations and Management Division were DSM's primary contacts at DSNY. Venetia Lannon was the primary contact at NYEDC.

SECTION II. OVERVIEW OF COST ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES
Various groups reviewing the DSNY model over the past several years have suggested that perhaps a different methodology would be preferable, or might yield results more favorable for recycling. Therefore, it is helpful to describe the various methodologies available for allocating costs before beginning the analysis of the DSNY model.
As a general overview, it is important to remember that there is more than one method for allocating costs, and all cost allocation methods rely on subjective decisions about how to allocate shared costs. The net result is that the combination of more than one acceptable methodology, combined with the need to make subjective decisions about allocation of shared costs under each methodology, provides for ample opportunity for honest people to disagree about the results.
Therefore, cost allocation should be viewed as an art rather than a science. The key is a consistent and defensible process for allocating shared costs that makes sense given the type of activity being analyzed.
This section (Section II) describes the methodologies commonly used to allocate costs. In Section IV we set forth DSM's analysis of DSNY's allocation decisions imbedded in their cost allocation model.
There are three primary methodologies that could be used to compare DSNY recycling and refuse costs. These are:
Total cost allocation Incremental cost analysis Activity based cost accounting
Total Cost Allocation
The DSNY model, developed by KMPG and DSNY in the early 1990's is a total cost allocation model. That is, all $1.35 billion dollars of DSNY's annual budget (FY 05) are allocated to three DSNY functions:
Collection and disposal of refuse Collection and processing of recyclables Cleaning (streets and baskets)
Once all costs have been allocated to these three functions, then the total cost for each function can be divided by the total tons managed by that function to determine a per ton cost.
The primary problem with total cost allocation models are that they typically allocate costs from the ""top down"" using a few surrogates to allocate all costs.7 For example, the DSNY model uses sanitation worker labor to allocate roughly 90% of DSNY's costs to the three functions, including
7 Description of problems with total cost accounting excerpted from Activity Accounting, an Activity Based Costing Approach, Brimson, James A.
 3

indirect costs which are not directly attributable to any one function,8 even though direct sanitation labor costs (posts) represent roughly 40% of DSNY's total budget, exclusive of export costs. For this reason, small differences in allocated costs (i.e., plus or minus 10 -15%) between functions should be viewed with an understanding that these differences may be the result of the allocation decisions instead of the result of actual differences in costs.
Because of the allocation problem, it is typically difficult to allocate costs among many different functions in a total cost allocation model; especially functions that make up a relatively small portion of the overall budget. In addition, these smaller functions are especially impacted by small differences in the allocation methodology because there aren't many tons to spread the allocation of indirect costs over.
The second, and related, problem associated with total cost allocation that especially impacts DSNY's allocation of costs to curbside collection of recyclables ­ the newest of the three functions ­ is that because all costs must be allocated to the three functions, ""sunk costs"" (e.g., extra garage space, administrative overhead) must be allocated proportionately to all three functions. This has an especially large impact on recycling because, for example in FY 05, for every 100 tons of refuse there were only 20 tons of recycling over which to spread these ""sunk"" costs.
Finally, because all indirect and ""sunk"" costs are allocated to refuse collection, cleaning, and recycling, one cannot use the difference in per ton costs of recycling and refuse from the total cost allocation model to project what would happen if recycling were no longer undertaken. That is because many of the costs that have been allocated to recycling would remain even if recycling were eliminated. For example, garage space that has been allocated to recycling would remain, as would the bulk of DSNY's administrative costs. And DSNY would still have to pick up the same tonnage of material, only this time it would be collected and disposed as refuse instead of recycling.
The correct way to analyze the true savings ­ or cost ­ of eliminating one of DSNY's functions would be to take the difference between total system costs with the function, and without the function. This is, in essence, incremental cost accounting, which is discussed in the next section.
Incremental Cost Accounting
Incremental costs can be defined as the change in costs due to a change in activity. There are two ways to use incremental costs. The first, which in essence is the economic definition of marginal costs, is the change in costs due to an incremental change in a given activity. For example, one could ask what the incremental cost would be to collect an additional 1,000 tons of refuse, over and above the 11,000 tons of refuse collected each day by DSNY. The incremental cost could be relatively small if there is sufficient capacity on the existing trucks, and sufficient time for labor to collect this additional refuse during the normal workday. Or, this cost could be quite high if the majority of trucks were already at capacity, and/or labor was already being utilized fully, requiring putting new trucks and Sanitation Workers on the street to collect this additional refuse.
Similarly, one could ask what the incremental cost would be to add another material to the recyclables that DSNY collects in the curbside recycling program. Again, the answer would depend on the capacity of the trucks and labor used to collect the existing material.
8 Throughout this report costs are reported in ranges, or rounded, to reflect the fact that although the total cost allocation model allocates all costs to the nearest dollar, there are many assumptions involved in the allocation process which significantly reduce the accuracy of the final allocations.
 4

Using short term marginal (or incremental) costs to analyze changes in refuse or recycling collection costs would result in a ""saw tooth"" type graph, where the addition of another increment of recycling or refuse collection would alternately cost very little, or a lot, depending on whether additional truck and sanitation worker capacity had to be added at the time of the change. The answer would also vary over time. For example, the number of Sanitation Workers varies year to year depending on retirements and restrictions on DSNY's ability to hire additional Sanitation Workers -- and the quantity of waste set out varies depending on the time of year and the economy.
Because this type of short term incremental cost analysis depends on the time when the analysis is conducted, and the capacity of the existing system at that time, short term incremental cost analysis is not a good method for analyzing the long-term impacts of adding or deleting curbside collection of recyclables.
A second type of incremental cost analysis is more appropriate for analyzing the impacts of adding or deleting curbside collection of recyclables, although it too suffers from short-term impacts. That is, one could analyze the incremental change in total system costs associated with collecting all of the material set out by New Yorkers as refuse, compared to the total system cost of collecting a certain portion of that material as recyclables. In this case, the incremental cost effectiveness of recycling is the reduction, or increase, in total system costs associated with the change.
DSNY's existing total cost allocation model could be used to conduct this analysis, essentially by running the model with and without recycling collection, although, as explained in the following section, an activity-based cost model would be a better tool for this type of analysis.
It is important to note here that one cannot deduct the avoided cost of the recyclables not going to landfill when conducting this type of systems analysis. It would result in double counting. That is because all of the system costs associated with collecting the material for recycling, including the processing costs and revenues for this material, have been accounted for, as well as the system costs associated with collecting the remaining material as refuse, including the disposal cost for this material. If the recyclables were going to be disposed as refuse, they would have had to have been collected as refuse ­ which would have been less costly than collecting as recyclables. The gains associated with the higher recycling collection cost have already been accounted for in the lower processing cost (if that is the case) and the recycling revenues.
This is an important point in assessing the relative merits of recycling and refuse collection in New York City. The key to sustainable recycling is to make recycling collection as efficient as possible, recognizing that the closer recycling collection costs come to refuse collection costs the greater the possibility that the lower processing cost for recycling (and associated recycling revenue) will lower total system costs below the system cost of managing all of the material as refuse. This accounts for the fact that refuse typically weighs more than recycling (on a per cubic yard basis), and there are greater amounts of it per stop, making per ton refuse collection inherently less costly.
 5

Activity Based Cost Accounting
Over the past ten years the methodology that has gained acceptance as the preferred approach for calculating the relative costs of refuse and recycling is Activity Based Cost Accounting. DSM typically uses this approach to build program, or activity based budgets for cities in the U.S. and internationally.
Under this approach, all of the costs for curbside recycling would be built from the ""bottom up"" (the opposite of total cost allocation) based on some key ""driver"" of recycling and refuse costs. In most cases this is the number of trucks necessary to collect recyclables and the number of trucks necessary to collect refuse.
Once the number of truck shifts is known, all other costs associated with each truck shift can be added to the truck cost and multiplied by the number of trucks used. In this case, because DSNY uses two Sanitation Workers to collect recyclables (and refuse), the annual cost of two Sanitation Workers can be added to the annual cost of owning and operating the truck, and then the administrative costs associated with that truck and those Sanitation Workers can be added, until all costs associated with putting a truck and two workers on the street are calculated.9
There are three primary benefits to activity based cost accounting. First and foremost, it allows for the development of detailed activity based budgets for a much finer breakdown of functions. For example, an activity based budget could be developed for such DSNY activities as:
· Curbside collection of recyclables and curbside collection of refuse; · Containerized collection of recyclables and containerized collection of refuse; · Special waste management programs (e.g., CFC removal, HHW programs); · Waste prevention programs; · Lot cleaning; · Snow plowing; and, · Organics management programs.
The second benefit of activity based cost accounting is that it is a very good tool for analyzing the impact of changing the system. For example, once the cost per truck has been developed for curbside refuse and curbside recycling collection, then one can evaluate eliminating or adding to recycling by changing the tonnage that must be picked up by either the recycling or refuse trucks. Trucks are then added or eliminated and the costs recalculated for each district (because productivity targets are different in each district), or City-wide.
The third benefit of this approach is that sunk costs (e.g., garage space not needed to house these trucks, or administrative personnel not required to administer the recycling collection program) are not assigned to recycling ­ or refuse. While there is no guarantee that eliminating these sunk costs would make recycling more cost effective than refuse, it would increase the odds of this occurring because there are so many fewer recycling tons than refuse tons to carry the burden of those sunk costs.
9 We understand the difficulty of calculating an average Sanitation Worker cost given the ability of Sanitation Workers to move between collection activities depending on seniority, however, this problem is no worse than the current problem of allocating all labor costs to the three functions.
 6

DSM's Approach Because of the merits of activity based cost accounting, DSM initially proposed to develop a new cost allocation model using activity based costing, based on models DSM had constructed for other cities. However, once we had had an opportunity to review the existing cost allocation model in detail, and to better understand DSNY's operations and constraints, it became clear that the sheer magnitude of DSNY's budget, limitations on DSNY's ability to collect activity based data, and the complexity of DSNY's operation made development of an entirely new model well beyond the scope and budget of this analysis. Of special concern is that Sanitation Workers within different wage scales can move to different tasks (e.g., to recycling or refuse or cleaning) on any given day depending on the number of workers assigned to each task in each district each day and the seniority of the Sanitation Workers reporting for work on any given day. DSNY's existing ""san form"" accounting system and the associated payroll tracking system makes it difficult to account for each worker (and wage rate) on each truck each day at this level of detail. Therefore, after meeting with DSNY and having an opportunity to review DSNY's total cost allocation model in detail, a decision was made to use the existing total cost allocation model as the basis for DSM's analysis. The existing model ­ with the changes recommended by DSM, below ­ is an acceptable methodology for allocating total costs, albeit with the inherent problems discussed in this report. More importantly, incorporating all of DSNY's costs into a new, activity based cost model (even if it were to create a better tool for analysis) would create an alternative, complex model, familiar only to DSM, and would involve a large investment of time and personnel on the part of DSNY.10 One important benefit of utilizing the existing model is that it already has formed the basis for discussions on the cost effectiveness of recycling, both within DSNY, with other City agencies, including NYEDC, the IBO, and the Comptroller's Office, and within the environmental community. One goal of this project has always been to better explain to all interested parties why recycling and refuse collection and disposal costs are what they are, and to use this explanation to evaluate the future role of curbside recycling in New York City.
10 As it was, DSNY has invested many hours in meeting with DSM, providing DSM with background data, and working on changes to the total cost allocation model requested by DSM, over the past two years.

SECTION III. OVERVIEW OF DSNY
Any analysis of curbside recycling and refuse collection and disposal in New York City must begin with at least a summary understanding of DSNY operations and costs. This is because many of the issues facing DSNY are unique to DSNY compared to other cities in the United States, beginning with the sheer size and scope of DSNY's responsibilities, and continuing through DSNY's long history of organization and unionization. Important factors include:
An annual budget of $1.35 billion (FY 05) which, for comparison is almost one-quarter of the entire state budget for Vermont or Delaware.
DSNY is responsible for collection of refuse and recycling from all residential units in the City. Very few other cities in the US collect from all buildings, no matter the size or number of units.11
DSNY also cleans the city, including street cleaning, emptying of litter baskets, and vacant lot cleaning.
DSNY has responsibility for snow and ice removal in the winter, utilizing its refuse and recycling trucks for plowing and salting/sanding.
Roughly 7400 unionized Sanitation Workers carry out or directly supervise refuse and recycling collection, cleaning, and snow and ice removal functions (referred to as ""san workers"") ­ working out of 59 district offices/garages located throughout the five boroughs.12
Workers are allocated to each district based on the collection, recycling and cleaning needs of the district determined by agreed upon ""productivity targets"" for refuse and recycling established in DSNY's contract with union workers. However, on any given day Sanitation Workers may be moved between districts depending on the needs of each district on that day and the number of Sanitation Workers who report for work on that day in each District.
The City-wide productivity target for refuse is an average of 10.6 tons of refuse per truck shift and 6.2 tons of recyclables per truck shift (FY 05), with a wide range among districts depending on density and waste generation. Sanitation Workers can be penalized for not meeting their productivity targets, which have been developed (and negotiated) over time based on historical collection records.
Two workers, both capable of driving, are required under the union contract for every refuse and recycling truck during collection. Many other cities and private haulers have moved to one person trucks, especially for recycling. While DSNY has begun to make this change for containerized collection, the potential exists for additional conversion to one person trucks in the future which may improve recycling collection efficiency.13
In addition to the roughly 7,400 Sanitation Workers, there is a large civilian workforce that enforces sanitation ordinances, collects and analyzes data, and administers the collection, cleaning, recycling and snow removal activity of the City.
After closing the Fresh Kills landfill in 2002, the City now owns no operating refuse disposal facilities, exporting roughly 62,000 tons of refuse each week (FY 05) to out-ofcity disposal facilities, either directly by truck, or through privately owned truck and rail transfer stations.
11 DSNY collects no waste generated by business or industry, leaving this entirely to private carters. 12 FY 2005 DSNY Annual Report 13 The ability to move to one person recycling collection trucks will be limited because of the need for Sanitation Workers to collect appliances and other bulky metal as part of recycling collection.
 8

Much of the refuse and recyclables are ""relayed"" during the second and third shift by a single driver to the transfer/disposal or processing facilities. While this relay reduces nonproductive collection time and overtime costs, it does add additional truck shifts for refuse and recycling. Despite the relatively large quantity of recyclables collected, DSNY owns no recycling processing capacity, relying instead entirely on existing private brokers and paper packing facilities located throughout the City and in New Jersey. Finally, DSNY is the only city DSM is aware of that collects appliances as part of its MGP curbside collection. This significantly changes the relative mix of paper and MGP collected, with MGP quantities (by weight) being greater than paper quantities in many areas of the City as opposed to most conventional residential curbside collection programs where paper typically represents around 70 percent of municipal recyclables set out. The impact of collecting appliances with the MGP is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it increases the weight of the recyclable material, which theoretically lowers per ton collection costs. On the other hand, the ability to load large appliances reduces the ability of DSNY to switch to one-person collection crews in the less dense districts. And, the appliances add a whole new level of potential contamination to the MGP once they are compacted in the truck. This reduces the value of the plastic (especially) and increases processing costs for MGP.

SECTION IV. DSM'S ANALYSIS OF THE COST ALLOCATION MODEL
DSM started the project with four days of meetings in New York City on December 6 through December 9, 2004. We met first with Executive Vice President of Infrastructure, Kate Ascher, and Venetia Lannon, of the Economic Development Corporation, and Deputy Commissioner Larry Cipollina, DSNY, to discuss the purpose and proposed scope of work for this project.
We then met with Director Robert Lange and Senior Policy Analyst, Samantha MacBride at DSNY's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling; with Elisabeth Franklin, Budget and Policy Analyst and Preston Niblack, Deputy Director of the Independent Budget Office and with Chris Boyd of the Comptrollers Office to learn what areas of investigation they believed would be most fruitful to pursue with respect to comparison of refuse and recycling costs.
The following day Deputy Commissioner Cipollina arranged a meeting for us with his staff, including:
David Nati (now retired), Director, Operations and Management Division Peter G. McKeon, Chief of Collection/Recycling Operations Marty Bellew, Director, Bureau of Waste Disposal Charles Stamm, Deputy Director, Planning and Budgeting Barbara Rothenberg, Deputy Director, Operations and Management Division Michael Ebert, Director, Planning and Budget
Deputy Commissioner Cipollina made it clear during the meeting that DSM could have complete access to his staff and to the cost allocation model for purposes of the analysis. He provided a hard copy of the 2002 model and, on request, an electronic version.
We requested an opportunity to observe refuse collection and recycling operations in various parts of the City so that we could gain a better understanding of operations underlying the DSNY cost functions. Chief McKeon made arrangements for us to tour various garage, collection, transfer and recycling operations in the Bronx, Manhattan, Staten Island, and Brooklyn on December 8 and 9, 2004. In each case we were given access to the District Superintendent to discuss truck and post reporting procedures, spare truck capacity, and any other issues we thought appropriate before going out to observe collection and transfer operations.
We then turned our attention to the 2002 cost allocation model (we ignored 2003 because of the change in the program eliminating glass and plastic collection in 2003), going through the model in detail and developing a series of questions for review with DSNY.
We returned to DSNY headquarters on January 14, 2005, meeting first with Chief McKeon and Director Nati to better understand the issue of posts ­ which drive much of the cost allocation model, and then meeting with Barbara Rothenberg and Charles Stamm, who are responsible for maintaining and updating the cost allocation model.
In February, 2005 DSNY provided DSM with the new 2004 cost allocation model and we shifted our emphasis to 2004 because of more up-to-date information, some changes in allocation subsequent to 2002, and because glass and plastic collection had resumed by 2004.14 We worked through the 2004 model and developed a list of questions for an April 8 meeting with
14 Plastic recycling resumed at the beginning of FY 04 (July, 2003), while glass recycling did not begin until late in FY 04 (April, 2004).

Barbara Rothenberg and Charles Stamm. As a result of the April 8 meeting, Charles Stamm made some minor revisions to the 2004 model reflecting some of our comments and correcting small errors we had detected in the spreadsheet. We received a revised 2004 spreadsheet dated April 19, 2005 and additional snow budget allocations on May 20, 2005, which became the basis for our analysis. Over the next six months we completed our analysis of the model and prepared a draft report, which we provided to DSNY in January, 2006. On January 30, 2006, we met with DSNY and NYEDC to review DSNY's comments on our analysis Subsequently NRDC and DSNY agreed that it would be better for DSM to focus our efforts on the FY 05 allocation because FY 05 was the first full fiscal year after resumption of collection of plastic and glass City-wide.
We were provided with the FY 05 model in May, 2006 with an agreement that DSNY would work with us to make mutually agreed upon changes to the model proposed by us. We received the final version of this revised model in September, 2006, which became the basis for a draft report which was provided to DSNY for review in early April, 2007. DSM received verbal comments on the April, 2007 draft in May, which are reflected (to the extent DSM agrees with DSNY's comments) in this Final Draft report.
Overview of DSNY Cost Allocation Model
At the time that DSM began working with DSNY, the 2004 model allocated DSNY's $1.35 billion budget to three major functions: refuse collection, recycling, and cleaning. While the allocation methodology varies by function and department, typically the allocation is based on ""posts"" (labor) assigned to the three functions to allocate costs. This is because sanitation labor (including fringe benefits) is the largest single cost category, at roughly 40 percent of DSNY's budget, and because DSNY keeps daily records of sanitation posts used for each of the three functions in each district.15
The allocation methodology is relatively complex and difficult to understand, requiring 32 linked worksheets to account for, and allocate, all of DSNY's costs. Despite these constraints, it is DSM's opinion that the cost methodology used by DSNY is an acceptable methodology to allocate costs, given the constraints of total cost allocation discussed above. Further, during our review of both the FY 04 and FY 05 allocations we have not found any indication of a deliberate attempt by DSNY to bias the results in favor of refuse over recycling.
However, one of the key problems with the model is that it lumps all ""recycling"" functions (ranging from composting on Rikers Island to waste prevention programs to curbside collection) together to derive a single cost per ton for ""recycling."" This makes it impossible to assess and compare curbside collection of recyclables (the function responsible for much of the debate on the merits of recycling versus refuse) and curbside collection of refuse.16
In addition, as with any allocation of a budget as large and complex as DSNY's, a number of decisions have been made by DSNY on allocation of costs not directly attributable to any given function, which impact on recycling and refuse comparisons. For example, in FY 04 overtime costs and chart shift differentials add up to $107 million, with another $46 million of labor related costs which include supper pay, holiday pay and uniforms. These costs are allocated proportionally across the functional activities (based on posts) in part because the ""scan"" input system utilized by DSNY to record overtime and related costs isn't designed to allocate actual
pay differentials associated with snow events, overtime and chart differentials among the different DSNY activities.
Another significant problem with the current model is that large cost items such as administration, and the associated legal and engineering functions of DSNY, are also allocated based on posts17 instead of based on actual expenditures devoted to managing each activity. While we understand the reasoning behind these allocation assumptions, the result is that posts (or Sanitation Workers assigned to each function each day) are the largest driver in the model determining the cost per ton each year. And, since Sanitation Workers are essentially interchangeable in the tasks they perform, the accuracy of post allocations becomes critical in comparing the cost of each DSNY activity.
Finally, it is DSM's opinion that the current cost allocation model essentially ignores the fully allocated cost of snow and ice removal, which negatively impacts on recycling, refuse, and cleaning cost allocations.
Each of these issues is discussed in detail below.
DSM's Proposed Revisions to the DSNY Model
During the course of our review we identified three important allocation issues which we believed required revision to more fairly allocate costs between recycling and refuse. We also identified areas where we believed the allocation could be revised in minor ways to more fairly allocate costs among the various functions. With the changes proposed by DSM (see below), we believe that curbside recycling and curbside refuse bear the cost allocation burden more proportionately than in the original model.
The primary revisions that we requested were:
· The addition of Snow and Ice Removal as a primary function · The separation of Curbside Recycling from other recycling and waste reduction activities · The addition of Recycling Revenues to curbside recycling collection costs
The Addition of Snow and Ice Removal as a Primary Function
As stated above, DSNY is responsible for snow and ice removal for the City. This responsibility is extremely important to the economy of the City, given (probably) millions in lost economic activity for each day that the City is shut down due to a major snow or ice event. If DSNY did not remove snow and ice with its refuse and recycling collection fleet and Sanitation Workers the City would either have a separate snow removal agency and/or would contract with private vendors to provide the service. In either case, costs for garage space, truck operation, maintenance and depreciation, and administrative overhead would all be attributable to snow and ice removal.
Prior to DSM's review of the cost allocation model DSNY only accounted for snow removal labor during a snow emergency, and supplies (e.g., salt and sand). This cost was deducted from DSNY's total costs based on a rolling five year average of previous year's costs for snow and ice removal.
We feel strongly, and have argued so with DSNY that snow and ice removal is an essential function of DSNY and must be treated in the same manner as refuse, recycling and cleaning.
17 DSNY uses the term ""headcount"" in this case, but we believe that headcount is still based on posts of sanitation workers.
 12

DSNY agreed to modify the FY 05 allocation to include snow and ice removal as a function, using posts assigned to snow during snow emergencies to allocate costs. While DSNY has come a long way in incorporating snow and ice removal as a separate function in the revised FY 05 allocation, which DSM has used for this analysis, it is DSM's opinion that DSNY has not yet fully integrated snow removal as an equal function to refuse, recycling and cleaning, and we have made additional adjustments to attempt to do so.
Separation of Curbside Collection of Recyclables from All Other Recycling and Waste Prevention Activities
The 2002 decision to eliminate curbside collection of glass and plastic was the catalyst for many of the subsequent attempts to evaluate the DSNY allocation model. As such we have viewed our task throughout the last several years as breaking out and fairly accounting for the costs of curbside recycling when compared to curbside collection of refuse. As such, we have worked with DSNY, as discussed below, to break out curbside recyclables collection from non-curbside recycling activities, which we believe should be separately accounted for, and to compare that with curbside collection of refuse.
We recognize, based on data provided to us by DSNY that roughly 15 percent of households in New York City are not curbside collection households. These households are served through dumpsters collected with front loading trucks, or roll on/roll off containers and hoist trucks. This is typically a more efficient and low cost way to collect refuse, and can be a low cost way to collect recyclables as well. It is also an area that DSNY has recently targeted for productivity gains by going to one person trucks.
However, because usage of these community dumpsters is anonymous, it is typical to have high refuse contamination in the recycling dumpsters. As such, many of these housing complexes no longer receive recycling collection because DSNY has been unable to control contamination rates in the recycling dumpsters.18 The net result is that inclusion of these households in the total cost allocation model, lumped with curbside households, is to reduce per ton refuse collection costs, but (because of the lack of recycling tonnage) increase the per ton recycling collection cost.
As proposed by DSNY at our January 2006 meeting to review the first draft report, the September 2006 version of the FY 05 allocation model separates curbside collection of refuse and recyclables from non-curbside collection activities. We believe that this is an important refinement of the model.
We also recognize that in the case of Freon removal, an argument can be made either way as to where to place this activity. This is because refrigerators and air conditioners are collected as part of the MGP curbside collection program, and those refrigerators and air conditioners could not be collected for recycling without Freon removal. However, Freon removal is mandated by federal law no matter how refrigerators and air conditioners are collected to protect the ozone layer. It is, therefore, our opinion that Freon removal, just like other HHW and special waste programs should be treated as a non-curbside recycling and waste prevention activity, and the costs should not be assigned to either curbside refuse or curbside recycling activities.
As stated above, one of the benefits of activity based cost accounting is that relatively small activities (e.g., Freon removal in this case) could be separately accounted for, as opposed to lumped into larger categories as DSNY's total cost allocation model currently does. In fact, as the discussion above illustrates, part of the reason that we continue to point out in our analysis that per ton costs that are within 10 or 15 percent of each other are, for all intents and purposes, equivalent, is that these type of judgment calls are typical of cost allocation models.
18 According to Chief McKeon during meetings with DSM.

Recycling Revenues
It is essential that recycling revenues be allocated to the curbside recycling activity because this is one of the primary (and potentially growing) benefits of separately collecting this material. In FY 05 recycling revenues from paper recycling were roughly $6.6 million.19 As discussed below, we believe that demand for secondary materials will continue to increase over time, making paper (and potentially plastic) more valuable looking forward.

Based on our analysis of the September 18, 2006 model supporting Table 1, we believe that there are still three areas where adjustments to DSNY's cost allocation methodology are warranted. These are:

Removal of additional non-curbside related recycling costs (Step 1) Allocation of debt service to snow and ice removal (Step 2) Addition of revenues from the sale of recycled materials (Step 3)

19 Includes reimbursements in barge and relay fees by Visy Paper.
 14

Step 1: Separate out All Non-curbside Recycling and Refuse Costs
In the first draft of this report, DSM advocated separating out all non-curbside related recycling costs. DSNY agreed, but under the condition that non-curbside related refuse costs also be separated from curbside refuse collection costs.
Therefore, the September 2006 version of the model received from DSNY allocated costs to:
· Curbside refuse; · Other refuse management; · Curbside recycling; and, · Other recycling.

These are shown in Table 2 below. The goal was to separate out the costs of all activities that are not part of (or required when) collecting recycling or refuse at the curb.

We have taken the separation one step further by moving Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling (BWPRR) non-curbside recycling costs to Other Recycling. Tables 3A and 3B illustrate the DSNY (Table 3A) and DSM (Table 3B) allocation impact, based on DSM's assumptions about reasonable allocations of the Bureau's costs.
The resulting impact is a per ton cost of $299 for curbside recycling and $270 for curbside refuse.
Step 2: Assign Indirect and Other DSNY Costs to Snow and Ice Removal
The greatest impact on per ton refuse and recycling costs is the cost of snow and ice removal. As stated above, DSNY's original cost allocation model carved out a relatively small ""snow budget."" This snow budget was derived from a running average of the direct costs of snow and ice removal over the past 3 ­ 5 years. These direct costs included:
Sanitation worker overtime incurred during a ""snow emergency"" when some, or all Sanitation Workers (depending on the predicted severity of the storm), are placed on 12 hour shifts and paid time and one-half over eight hours.

 16

Plow and sand/salt spreader preparation time spent in the fall. The cost of salt and sand.

Working with DSM, DSNY agreed to more accurately allocate labor costs related to snow and ice removal and assign them to the snow category. Snow posts were estimated by DSNY by looking at actual snow overtime payroll reports and recalculating a post count from total hours devoted to snow. From this, other costs, such as administrative overhead, could be allocated to snow and ice removal because, as discussed above, most of the allocations in the model are based on the post count.

DSNY's September 2006 version of the model resulted in a snow and ice removal cost of roughly $82.25 million dollars. This represents 6 percent of DSNY's total budget. This compares to snow and ice removal of 15 to 25 percent of the City of Columbus and Boston's refuse and recycling budgets, respectively.20

It remains DSM's opinion that snow and ice removal is an essential function of DSNY and should bear the same total cost allocation burdens as refuse, cleaning and recycling, using the same exact cost allocation methodology. Therefore, we have gone through the 17 functional areas of DSNY's FY 05 budget and tried to identify other costs that should be allocated to snow and ice removal. The area that we have identified as having the greatest impact is debt service on collection vehicles and on garages.

The impact of assigning a portion of the debt service associated with collection vehicles and garages to the snow and ice removal function is shown below. It not only increases snow costs but also reduces some of the debt service costs allocated to refuse and to recycling.21

Further, we believe that debt service costs should be allocated based on truck shifts and not posts, since truck shifts more accurately reflect the portion of time that the truck would be in use either for snow and ice removal or for collecting and relaying refuse or recyclables.22 DSNY's and DSM's debt service allocations are shown below in Tables 4A and 4B.
20 This is at best a rough estimation because it is difficult to assure that the reported budgets for Columbus and Boston include the same administrative costs incurred by DSNY. 21 DSNY has argued that they would spec their refuse and recycling trucks exactly the same with or without snow and ice removal, and would purchase the same number of vehicles. While we don't disagree with this, the point remains that these trucks are used for snow and ice removal, and if they weren't some other department or private vendor would be allocating these costs to snow and ice removal. 22 The use of posts assumes that there are two Sanitation Workers on the truck. This is not the case during relays and may not be the case during plowing and sanding.
The impact of assigning part of the debt service costs to snow and ice removal (Table 4C) is more significant to the per ton cost of recycling than refuse because the reduction in costs are spread over fewer tons. The resulting per ton costs for curbside refuse and curbside recycling would be approximately $267 and $294, respectively after taking this step.

Other areas that DSM believes warrant future investigation by DSNY as to whether they should be assigned to the snow and ice removal costs/budget include:
· The cost of field support (none of this cost is currently allocated to snow); · Additional administrative costs (of which 5.9% of PS cost and no OTPS costs except for
fuel costs and no debt service are allocated to snow); · The costs of ""Building Management"" which currently has none of the costs allocated to
snow and ice removal activities; and, · The costs of ""Motor Equipment"" which currently has none of the OTPS or the PS costs
allocated to snow and ice removal activities.

 18

Step 3: Assign Recycling Revenues to Recycling Costs

The current DSNY model does not allocate revenues from the sale of recyclable materials to recycling. The impact of subtracting the roughly $6.6 million dollars in FY 05 revenues from the cost of recycling in FY 05 reduces the cost of recycling by about $11 per ton to roughly $284 per ton.

Enforcement
The other area that DSM believes may not be fairly allocated is enforcement costs. The current model does not allocate any enforcement costs to refuse, which seems unreasonable. We believe that some of the costs of enforcement should fall on refuse as well as recycling and cleaning. DSNY worked with DSM to try to determine a better allocation but this work is not yet completed.
Result of Changes in Allocation
The net impact of changes in allocation completed by DSM for FY 05 are that per ton curbside refuse collection and disposal costs are estimated to be $267 per ton, and per ton curbside recycling costs $284 per ton. This contrasts with DSNY's September 2006 allocation of $262/ton for refuse and $306/ton. The net result of all of the changes to the model for FY 05 is that curbside recycling was, on average across the City, roughly six percent more expensive than curbside refuse collection and disposal in FY 05. The word ""roughly"" is used here because the actual difference in costs could be less than or greater than six percent, especially given the many assumptions about allocating large shared costs, and the uncertainties associated with the assignment of sanitation worker overtime when they are ""off chart.""


Why were average per ton curbside recycling costs greater than per ton refuse collection and disposal costs in FY 05?
The primary reason for higher per ton costs for curbside recycling is simply that recycling collection crews collect less tons in a shift than refuse crews. Because labor costs are such a large component of DSNY's overall budget (and allocation surrogate), the lower productivity targets for recycling collection (defined as tons per truck shift) results in higher per ton collection costs.23
The impact of direct collection labor costs and of overtime and ""other"" labor costs on per ton costs are shown below in Tables 8A and 8B below. As illustrated by Table 8, each ton of curbside recyclables collected incurs almost double the labor and fringe cost of a ton of refuse under this total cost allocation model. It is primarily because of the high cost of export of refuse, when compared to the net processing cost of recyclables (after deducting revenues for paper) that curbside recycling does as well as it does in many areas of New York City.

23 DSM is not suggesting that DSNY's productivity targets are wrong, but rather that the lower amount of tonnage of recyclables (in comparison to refuse) now being set out per stop results in lower productivity targets. See further discussion on page 23 below.
 20
Paper versus MGP Recycling
The Independent Budget Office stated in their February 2004 analysis of DSNY's 2002 cost allocation that curbside collection of paper was, on average, less costly than curbside collection and disposal of refuse.24 Our analysis of the FY 05 total cost allocation comes to the same conclusion. When paper revenues are included, the city-wide average cost of curbside collection of paper is roughly ten percent less per ton than the city-wide average cost of curbside collection of refuse.
It should be noted, however, that the City-wide average masks significant variations on a districtby-district basis. Based purely on district-by-district recycling collection productivity data provided to DSM by DSNY, we believe that there are districts within the City where curbside collection of MGP is more cost effective than either curbside paper or curbside refuse collection. There are other districts where neither curbside paper or curbside MGP are currently cost effective compared to curbside refuse.
DSNY has not provided DSM with district-by-district refuse export costs with which to perform this detailed district-by-district comparison, and it is beyond the scope of this analysis. However, the results would be useful in targeting future recycling programs and could be compiled by DSNY using the cost allocation model, district-by-district refuse export data, and district-by-district productivity data.

SECTION V. LOOKING FORWARD
Our analysis has been divided into two parts. First, we have estimated the impact of proposed changes to the cost allocation model assumptions for FY 05 -- the most recent year for which the cost allocation model had been calculated by DSNY as of the time of DSM's analysis. Then, we have used the FY 05 cost allocation model to examine what might happen to costs looking forward given the cost allocation assumptions used in the FY 05 model.
Here it is important to note that a cost allocation model is not a forecasting model. While it can provide a rough guide to what might happen if certain changes occur, it is not designed to project costs into the future. In fact, it is more accurate to say that changes can be made to costs and tonnage in the FY 05 cost allocation model to assess what would have happened in FY 05, and that these impacts can be used to judge what is likely to happen in the future if these changes actually occur.
The reason the cost allocation model cannot be used as a forecasting tool is that the model is static. It is based on a specific set of actual circumstances and costs that occurred in FY 05. Changes to the base model will occur in each succeeding year that will change the relative allocation among the three functions. Some of these may be favorable to recycling and some may not.
However, in the longer run there are many factors that point to average per ton recycling costs falling below refuse costs. These include the following:
Export costs The impact of changes in waste composition on collection productivity over time Processing and marketing costs for recycling Relay costs
Each of these are discussed below.
Export Costs
The greatest uncertainty looking forward is most likely export costs for refuse.25 While DSNY has received long-term bids for export of refuse which DSNY estimates will average $107 per ton in 2009 and $124 per ton in 2014,26 not all of the long term contracts have been signed.27 Negotiations of key points may have significant impacts on costs over time. In addition, circumstances beyond the control of either DSNY or the large waste management companies bidding on export may also have a significant impact on future costs. In almost every case, these impacts will be felt as higher, not lower future export costs. In fact, the New York Times reported that export costs could go as high as $160/ton.28
To demonstrate the significance of these numbers, if one simply substitutes export costs at $124 for current export costs in the FY 05 model, costs for curbside recycling of both paper and MGP
would essentially be equal to the cost of curbside collection of refuse ($285/ton for refuse compared to $284/ton for recycling). At $160/ ton, curbside refuse collection and export would be roughly 13 percent higher than curbside collection of recyclables.
Changes in Collection Productivity
One of the primary reasons why it has been historically difficult for curbside collection of recyclables to compete with curbside collection of refuse on a cost per ton basis is that the productivity goals for recycling are significantly lower than for refuse. The City-wide target (FY 05) for recycling was 3 tons and 2.6 tons for paper and MGP, respectively, for the dual bin truck routes (or 5.6 tons per truck) and 6.8 and 7.2 tons for paper and MGP, respectively for the single compartment trucks. This compares with a City-wide average for refuse of 10.6 tons. These lower targets for recycling are a combination of the lighter weight nature of recyclables with lower setouts of recyclables.
Because two Sanitation Workers are on each truck, whether it be refuse or recycling, the difference in productivity targets means that each ton of recyclables collected uses between 45 and 89 percent more labor than a ton of refuse (depending on the type of truck used for recyclables collection).
This difference in labor drives the majority of the cost allocations in DSNY's total cost allocation model. As a result, recycling must ""make up"" all of this difference in collection costs in the difference between recycling processing costs/revenues and refuse export costs.
Looking forward, the potential exists for recycling to become significantly less costly. This is because DSNY's Waste Characterization Study demonstrates that 22 percent of the material collected as refuse is designated recyclables.29 This means that increased education and enforcement, combined with increased maturity of the recycling program could result in additional recyclables set out for recycling instead of as refuse.30
This is good news for recycling because the majority of recycling trucks are not packed out at the end of the truck shift. That is, the trucks have the capacity to hold more recyclables than are being collected during the truck shift.31 Instead, the trucks are time limited. This means that if additional material is set out for recycling ­ either at each stop, or at stops that previously did not set out recycling -- costs for collection will not increase appreciably in most districts while the tonnage will increase.
Processing Revenues and Costs
As discussed above, it is important to note that the proposed Sims Hugo Neu contract is not necessarily going to reduce recycling costs compared to refuse in the short run. A long term contract with Sims Hugo Neu has not been signed, although is apparently close to being
completed. Processing costs of roughly $52 to $57 per ton are expected under this long-term (20 year) contract between DSNY and Sims Hugo Neu.
Per ton processing costs in the mid-$50's for MGP would be considered relatively high compared to rates of $25 to $35 per ton for MGP typically being offered by dual stream material recovery facilities in the eastern United States.32 We recognize, however, based on our observations, the Waste Characterization study, and discussions with Waste Management officials who have been responsible for processing some of the MGP delivered from Sims Hugo Neu facilities, that high residue rates and compacted broken glass mixed with plastic film, makes New York City's MGP more costly to process. This is in part because DSNY collects appliances with MGP, and because MGP is set out in blue plastic bags which become a contaminant during processing. (It is also worth noting that New York City's refuse/export costs are high in comparison to other jurisdictions in the East, and indeed, in comparison to the rest of the country.)
In the long run, the fact that paper and MGP processing prices will be locked in ­ with the potential for revenue sharing ­ while refuse export costs face significant upside uncertainties, will tend to drive recycling costs down relative to refuse costs.
This is especially the case because factors such as increasing fuel costs which would increase export costs will act to increase the value of secondary materials. That is, as petroleum prices increase, the value of post consumer plastic will increase. And if the Chinese and Indian economies continue to grow ­ along with other developing countries such as Vietnam ­ there will be continued export demand for plastic, metals and paper, all of which are in short supply in many of these same rapidly growing countries. For this reason, it is DSM's opinion that future prices for recyclables, while continuing to fluctuate as commodities, will trend higher than historical averages.
Relays
There has been a great deal of discussion concerning the use of relays for refuse and recycling and whether the relay data reported by DSNY are correct, and if not, what impact would changes to relays have on per ton recycling and refuse costs.
Based on our observations of DSNY's operations, discussions with district superintendents, and Chief McKeon, it is DSM's opinion that the relay data used in the cost allocation model are relatively accurate. This is because many of the recycling trucks must be relayed to either the Visy plant (for paper) on Staten Island, or to New Jersey (for MGP). And, this problem will get worse for recycling until the contract with Sims Hugo Neu is completed, and the resulting longterm facilities are constructed for receiving recyclables in the various boroughs, including a large central plant in Sunset Park on the Brooklyn waterfront. In any case, as illustrated by Table 9 below, relay costs, while significant, are not great enough to significantly impact on the relative cost of recycling and refuse.
32 See for example prices for MGP delivered to the FCR MRF in Chelsea, Massachusetts serving the Boston metropolitan area or the costs and revenue sharing agreements for the new 20 year contract for the Springfield, Massachusetts MRF owned by MassDEP and privately operated.
More importantly, once the proposed new Sims Hugo Neu facilities have been constructed, relay costs for recycling should drop because more trucks should be able to haul recyclables direct to Sims Hugo Neu facilities located in each borough.

Conclusions Looking Forward
As discussed throughout this analysis, there are significant uncertainties looking forward with respect to both refuse and recycling. However, the general conclusion has to be that the factors affecting future costs point toward increasing refuse export costs and stable or falling recycling collection and processing costs. For this reason, the conclusion must be that curbside collection of recyclables will play an increasingly important role in stabilizing DSNY's long-term solid waste management costs.
Based on our analysis of FY 05 cost allocation, the difference in per ton costs between curbside recycling collection and processing and refuse collection and export are relatively insignificant today given the large amounts of indirect costs that must be broadly allocated to refuse, cleaning and recycling in the total cost allocation model.
Nevertheless, accepting these uncertainties in the model, over the next several years ­ while export costs remain relatively stable under the existing interim export contracts, and new inborough dumping capacity for recyclables remains limited ­ it is likely that average per ton, citywide curbside recycling costs will remain higher than average curbside refuse collection and export costs.
However, once the ability to unload recycling on-shift, as opposed to through relay, becomes available for many of the districts that currently must relay recyclables, and the new, and potentially higher refuse export contracts begin, the spread between recycling and refuse will fall. As illustrated above, export costs of $124/ton or greater would have made average curbside collection of paper and MGP less costly than curbside refuse collection in FY 05.
For these reasons, it is our general conclusion that recycling will begin to reduce overall system costs for DSNY within the near future ­ at least within the next five to six fiscal years ­ and will act as a significant buffer against the uncertainties of future refuse export costs.

NRDC-2010-5.txt,"

The Accord broke through years of negotiating gridlock to achieve four critical goals:
1. For the  first time, developed and developing countries representing more than 80 percent
of the world’s global warming pollution agreed to reduce their emissions (see over for details). Developing country participants include China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, South Africa, and South Korea. By the end of January 2010, all of the big emitters have recorded their commitments officially in the Accord (in Appendix I and Appendix II).2
2. For the  first time, China is officially in the game—putting emission cuts on the table and agreeing to open its books to international scrutiny.
3 The Accord allows the international community to evaluate countries’ adherence to their commitments. The United States, Europe, Japan, China, India, and other large developed
and developing countries have agreed to report
on emission levels, actions, policies, and progress toward their commitments at least every two years. These reports will be subject to international consultation and analysis under agreed-upon guidelines.
4. Countries agreed on actions to stem the loss of the world’s tropical forests. The agreement outlines the basic architecture and  financing for international forest protection, which accounts for approximately 15 percent of global emissions.
The Copenhagen Accord delivers what America needs from the international process: a commitment from the leaders of all key countries to join together to curb global warming. But to fulfill that promise, the Senate must act swiftly on comprehensive energy and climate change legislation to launch a clean energy economy at home and ensure global leaders live up to their end of the bargain.
The Copenhagen Accord
Foundations for International Action on Climate Change
The Copenhagen Accord, hammered out in December by President Obama and leaders of more than two dozen key countries, is a significant step forward in forging international cooperation to tackle global warming.1 These signatories—including the United States, China, India, the European Union, and Japan—represent more than 80 percent of the world’s global warming pollution from energy and deforestation. Also included are some of the nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
More than 120 countries in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have accepted this agreement.
Energy Facts
The Copenhagen Accord
Foundations for International Action on Climate Change
The Copenhagen process has shifted climate politics, compelling all big countries to act
and increase their ambition to cut emissions. Countries representing more than 80 percent of the world’s emissions have now signaled that they will undertake clear steps to reduce their emissions, including the following:
China
Committed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions intensity (emissions per unit of GDP) by 40 to
45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. China
has also set energy and forestry targets: to build up energy from non-fossil fuels to 15 percent of China’s primary energy consumption by 2020, and to increase forest cover by 40 million hectares by 2020.
India
Committed to reducing its emissions intensity by 20 to 25 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. To
meet and exceed this goal, India is increasing fuel efficiency standards by 2011; adopting building energy codes by 2012; increasing forest cover to sequester 10 percent of India’s annual emissions; increasing the fraction of India’s electricity derived from wind, solar, and small hydro to 20 percent by 2020 (from the current level of 8 percent).
Brazil
Committed to reduce emissions growth by 36 to 39 percent below business- as-usual by 2020—a level
estimated to cut Brazil’s emissions to 1994 levels. This commitment was recently signed into law
by President Lula of Brazil. Brazil also pledged to cut deforestation by 80 percent from historic levels by 2020.
Indonesia
Committed to reduce emissions by 26 percent below business as usual by 2020, and by as much
as 41 percent with international support.
South Africa
Committed to reduce emissions growth 34 percent by 2020 and to 42 percent in 2025
with  financial, technological, and capacity- building support from the developed world.
South Korea
Committed to cut economy-wide emissions to 30 percent below
the projected 2020
levels—reducing emissions to around 4 percent below 2005 levels.
Mexico
Committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions up to 30 percent compared to business as usual levels
by 2020, provided there is adequate  financial and technological support.

OX-2009-14.txt,"Oxfam analysis of the Copenhagen climate change conference
The empty political statement issued from Copenhagen shows a historic lack of leadership. The key political decisions were not taken at the start of these negotiations and they have still not been taken. This job has not been done.
As a result, the blame game has started. Oxfam considers that the primary cause of failure lies with the rich nations ­ they have failed to come with proposals that would fulfil their responsibilities, while trying to shift the burden onto developing countries. It is welcome that the US, as one of the biggest polluters, has rejoined the multilateral system. But their proposals must strengthen, not undermine, the commitments from rich countries, which fall far short of averting climate catastrophe.
Poor countries negotiated strongly for a deal that is consistent with the science, and which aimed to protect vulnerable people and planet. The shame of Copenhagen was that rich countries have negotiated primarily on behalf of vested interests and industrial lobbies.
At best, we are now confronted with deadly delay that means unnecessary tragedy for millions of families. The impacts will be felt in every country, and will fall particularly hard on poor people in developing countries.
Just as alarming is that there is no clear and credible way forward to conclude a legally binding agreement soon. Leaders ducked the political decisions that have been lacking since the launch of negotiations two years ago in Bali. There is still no agreement to the fundamentals. This is unacceptable.
ANALYSIS OF THE OUTCOMES The negotiations started with ten days of meetings between officials and then the high level segment of three days involving Ministers and Heads of State. The talks got off to a bad start with the leak of a secret draft of an outcome statement that the Danish government, as President of the Conference, was preparing. A selected group of countries was consulted in the drafting process, and the draft was seen to be biased towards the interests of the rich nations. When the Danish Prime Minister subsequently tried to introduce a draft text as a basis for negotiations, developing countries angrily rejected it.
Negotiations continued in the two tracks that were agreed in Bali two years ago ­ a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and a new Long Term Agreement (LCA). In Copenhagen, negotiators reduced the size of the document, but did little to agree the hundreds of unresolved issues.
There was also clumsy management of the talks over the attempt to combine the two negotiating tracks, strongly resisted by developing countries, which saw it as part of an effort by rich nations to evade their commitments to emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol. The talks teetered on the brink of collapse several times, wasting valuable negotiating time.
Then the Climate Change Ministers and 115 Heads of State arrived. The particular role for the high level segment was to come to agreement on the big political decisions that have been blocking negotiations. They failed to do so, primarily because rich countries, having promised to play their trump cards at the eleventh hour, turned up almost empty handed.
Global goal: Leaders could not even agree on a goal to keep global temperature increase well below 2°C ­ they only referred to the goal and undertook to enhance their action. So far, Annex 1 emissions cuts tabled in negotiations add up to only 13-19 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. When adjustments are made for the effect of loopholes on AAU surpluses (hot air), LULUCF (forestry) accounting and bunker fuels, Annex 1 emissions would actually

rise. This puts us on track for global temperature rise of well above 2°C and catastrophic climate change ­ modelling suggests by as much as 3.9°C.
Finance: The announcement of US$100 billion for adaptation and mitigation by 2020 is an important step forward ­ finally specific amounts of funding are being discussed. But there is no clarity on how much will be public finance, which are reliable and predictable funds that will allow poor countries to plan and invest in adaptation and low carbon development. It seems that rich countries are keen to inflate the total with private finance through market mechanisms. Furthermore, there is no clear commitment that this money would not come from existing aid commitments, effectively diverting future spending away from essential services in poor countries. Finally there is no clarity on the individual commitments rich countries will make. This potentially continues a long line of empty promises by world leaders.
Legally Binding: The commitment to complete the deal is a hollow promise without a clear plan for what a legally binding treaty or treaties will look like, whether all rich nations will be legally bound to reduce their emissions, and how we will get there ­ and no new commitment period established under Kyoto.
NEXT STEPS
Business-as-usual negotiations are failing to solve the climate crisis. Options on the table are too vague for decision-making, and do not reflect evolving climate science. Technical negotiators are debating issues that need ministerial mandate but too little time is given for ministers' talks to make progress leading to last-minute late-night decisions. Governments are still focused on securing national interest instead of securing our shared destiny.
The international process must now gear up to a new level of talks. Sustained, intense and focussed engagement must run throughout the year ­ at the political, scientific, technical and public levels. The key to unlock these issues is political agreement on fundamental milestones. To move forward, negotiators must first agree a global goal, a scientifically credible range for mid-term emissions reductions, and a framework for funding.
1. Heads of State: demonstrate climate leadership ­ The last two years of competitive negotiations must now be turned into collaborative engagement for a deal in 2010, starting with a new mandate driven by Heads of State. 2. Ministers: prepare for Sleeping-Bag Ministerials ­ A set of intense quarterly meetings for both tracks of negotiations must drive a political agreement. Each ministerial should end only when its mandated milestone is reached: for example, to halve the number of brackets in the text, and halve the size of the numeric ranges set out in the remaining brackets. 3. Climate scientists: put facts back at the heart of negotiations ­ Climate science is evolving rapidly and alarmingly, but negotiations continue on the basis of outdated projections. Updated estimates on emissions trajectories from the IPCC are urgently needed, including a scenario for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5oC. 4. Negotiators: provide analytical support for decisions ­ Vague definitions and unclear options in the text are holding up negotiations. Technical experts must clarify definitions and rules (such as on LULUCF accounting) to close loopholes, and detail options on burden sharing criteria and innovative finance mechanisms. LDCs should have access to technical support from a standing team in the UNFCCC. Civil society could contribute to the integrity of the negotiations by providing them with a formal role in submitting proposals. 5. Public support: build the case and widen the base ­ Over the past two years there has been a massive increase in public understanding of climate change and commitment to action. From the boardrooms of progressive businesses to communities across the developing world there is now a global demand for leaders to conclude a fair, ambitious and legally binding deal. Copenhagen may have been a cop out but Oxfam will continue to work with our partners and allies across the world in an attempt to avert climate catastrophe.

Hang Together or Separately?
How global co-operation is key to a fair and adequate climate deal at Copenhagen

We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.
Benjamin Franklin, at the signing of the United States' Declaration of Independence, 1776

A fair and adequate global climate regime requires a massive effort across the board to reduce the risks to lives and livelihoods that poor people face first and most. Rich countries must reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions first and fastest, with ambitious targets at home. High levels of rich-country pollution over the last century mean that even ambitious emissions-reductions targets will not be enough to avoid catastrophic climate change. Deep emissions reductions in rich countries are still critical, but climate security will now be won or lost as a result of co-operative efforts in which rich countries finance largescale reductions in emissions in developing countries. Establishing a Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism could achieve these reductions while respecting principles of equity, and delivering tangible development gains for poor people. This must be a centrepiece of the Copenhagen deal in December 2009. But much greater political attention and support is needed for this vital part of the deal to be developed in time.

Summary
2

Climate change offers humanity no second chances. An agreement struck at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen in just six months' time could pave the way for a post-2012 climate regime that staves off catastrophic climate change. Delay or failure risks locking in runaway climate change, and will certainly multiply the costs of responding to its negative impacts ­ costs that are already being borne mostly by poor people.
A climate deal in Copenhagen will only be achieved if world leaders are prepared to acknowledge ­ and act on ­ the deep injustice at the heart of climate change. The victims of this injustice are the hundreds of millions of poor people who now bear the consequences of more than a century of rampant carbon emissions largely from the industrialised world. Whether they are Pacific Islanders forced from their homes due to storms and sea-level rise, or rural African communities who face ever-worsening droughts and food shortages linked to climate change, the people affected first and worst are all amongst those least responsible for ongoing emissions. Any deal that does not redress this injustice is no deal at all.
A fair deal means one that both keeps global warming as far below 2°C over pre-industrial temperatures as possible, and that delivers sufficient resources so that poor people can avoid the worst impacts of already inevitable climate change. Fairness also means that those countries most responsible for past emissions and most able to assist, take a lead in cutting emissions first and fastest.
Oxfam's assessment is that negotiations towards a fair and low-risk agreement in Copenhagen are seriously off-track. The emissionsreductions targets of rich, industrialised countries are, rightly, a leading focus in both domestic and international debates. Across the board these targets still fall far short of what is required. But an even bigger challenge lies hidden in the depths of the UN climate talks.
Even the most substantial levels of mitigation action in rich countries ­ emissions cuts adding up to 40 per cent below 1990 levels or more ­ fall short of what's needed to stay below 2°C, let alone their fair contribution to the global effort. If Annex I countries achieve this level of reduction, an equivalent reduction (in tonnes of CO2) in developing countries will still be required. This can only be achieved through cooperative efforts involving both rich and developing countries ­ an ambitious joint venture founded on fairness. Unless a mechanism is designed and agreed to achieve this scale of additional emissions cuts ­ now ­ a fair and low-risk agreement in Copenhagen is highly unlikely. How would such a mechanism operate, and what would it take?
Oxfam proposes a Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism which aims to enable developing countries to achieve development and poverty reduction goals, whilst contributing to global mitigation efforts.

This Mechanism would match reliable flows of financial support from Annex I countries1 with real emissions reductions from developing countries. Under this scheme, Annex I countries would provide enough money to incentivise emissions reductions in developing countries to keep global warming as far below 2°C as possible. Developing countries may use these resources to implement strategies with specified emissions reductions and consistent with national priorities. Depending on their `available economic capability' (above a `development threshold') they would receive up to 100 per cent financing for the full incremental costs of emissions reductions.
Relative to their vital importance, emissions cuts achieved through such co-operative mitigation action have received rather little political attention or support. Although delegates to the UN climate negotiations are preoccupied with so-called `measurable, reportable and verifiable' mitigation action and support, national debates in most rich countries focus overwhelmingly on the limits to, and potential of, emissions cuts within their borders. At best, rich countries simply assume that international mitigation opportunities are cheap, plentiful and easily attained as a means of `offsetting' emissions at home.
Based on studies to date, Oxfam estimates that at a very minimum, $150bn in public investment will be required each year to facilitate the necessary mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries. Though this is a large sum, it is many times less than the $4 trillion spent by developed countries on the financial crisis so far, or the $1.3 trillion of annual global military spending. Proposals to date fall well short of generating the financing required in this area, and do not sufficiently incorporate the key principles of responsibility (for historic emissions) and capability (to pay) in determining who pays what.
Developing countries must be assured of predictable flows of finance to embark on global mitigation actions. This would require financing the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism from the sale, auction or levy of allowances industrialised countries need to meet their mitigation obligations (Assigned Amount Units, or AAUs), or from other reliable sources. By stimulating investment in low carbon development in developing countries, rich countries both ensure that the biggest sources of future emissions are addressed, and help develop markets for their own low carbon technology solutions.
Making such a mechanism possible will require industrialised countries to assume a so-called `double duty'. First, Annex I countries must reduce their combined emissions by at least 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020. Oxfam's analysis of fair shares of the overall Annex I target suggests that more than 95 per cent of this Annex I target falls to just six countries and groups, which should adopt emissions targets (in relation to 1990 levels) as follows: Australia (40 per cent), Canada (43 per cent), the EU (44 per cent), Japan (56 per cent), Russia (20 per cent), and the USA (45 per cent) by 2020. All of these countries must achieve a majority of these reductions within their domestic economies.
Secondly, industrialised countries must provide funding ­ $150bn per
3

year at the very least ­ through the sale, auction, or levy of AAUs ­ to finance a Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism that can incentivise large-scale emissions reductions in developing countries and finance adaptation. And what of the fair share of developing countries in this venture? Oxfam's view is that calls for developing countries to take on commitments in Copenhagen equal to the scale or nature of those required from rich countries are misguided and deeply unfair. This is due to a legacy of broken promises; a long history of excessive GHG pollution; and substantially greater levels of wealth. If rich countries deliver on their double duty, then developing countries can be reasonably expected to `hang together' and co-operate. This should entail contributing what they are able to pay (in line with available economic capability) towards mitigation actions that limit overall emissions by 2020, consistent with minimising risks of catastrophic climate change. All countries agreed the Bali Action Plan in 2007, but rich countries have yet to provide a clear signal that they are willing to deliver on its provisions. The extent and means of rich-country financing for mitigation actions in developing countries is central to a fair deal in Copenhagen. The lack of progress in this area, both on amounts and means of financing, now seriously threatens to undermine any future deal. Developing countries have shown they are prepared to do their part. It is now up to rich countries to provide the means.

Dancing with disaster

I found a flaw in the model that... defines how the world works... I had been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well.
Alan Greenspan, former Chair of the US Federal Reserve Board, in testimony on the financial crisis before the US Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 23 October 2008

This paper argues that for the Copenhagen UN climate conference to succeed, all governments must move quickly to agree arrangements that guarantee developing countries a predictable flow of resources at scale in order to deliver a major portion of the global mitigation action required. Section 2 outlines the central importance of equity to the agreements expected in Copenhagen, and defines fair shares. Section 3 outlines the details of a proposed Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism that Oxfam believes is required to fill the gap. Section 4 discusses the financial and political requirements of this proposal, and Section 5 concludes with recommendations. To begin, Section 1 outlines the consequences of inaction that poor people already suffer, and the available scientific guidance on what's needed to minimise the risks they face.
Climate change offers humanity no second chances ­ no room for flawed models. The economic crisis now changing the fortunes of billions of people will be studied for decades and centuries to come, in particular the way that systemic risk was hidden under the noses of the most powerful decision-makers. The history of climate change may go down as the most well documented collapse of human civilisations. Or, it may be the story of how leaders changed their perception of risk and mobilised the political will to lead their countries through rapid economic and policy reforms unprecedented in human history but necessary for survival.

Typhoon Reming blew away Alma Bredin's house in 2006, leaving only the concrete floor (see Box 1, below). Credit: Stanley So / Oxfam Hong Kong Either way, surprising and sudden changes will feature strongly in the narrative. If the risks now in plain view are ignored, rapid changes in
5

the Earth's environment will become irreversible. The choice between these two futures will hinge in part on whose lives and livelihoods are considered in the assessment of risk.
With less than a 1°C global temperature increase since 1850, climate impacts are already a clear and present danger for millions, with almost all the people at risk living in poverty across the developing world. Oxfam is projecting that by 2015 ­ the target date for the Millennium Development Goals ­ the average number of people affected by climate-related disasters each year will grow by more than 50 per cent to 375 million.2
People are being forced to relocate from their homes due to rising sea levels. Hunger and malnutrition are being driven in part by a growing number of floods and droughts, and lives and livelihoods are at risk from an increase in extreme events.
Box 1: More intense typhoons devastate Philippine coastal villages
Alma Bredin (40, pictured above) and her family (9 in total) live in the coastal area of Subok in Barangay Angas on San Miguel Island. The island experiences frequent typhoons. But, in recent years, Alma says they have been more frequent and much stronger than before. Typhoon Reming in 2006 blew away her house, and only the concrete floor was left. She said that the ocean waves were up as high as the top of the palm tree. `The weather is getting more serious. There are more heavy rains and more flooding, and they're causing more calamities on the island.' Says Bredin. Her family relies on fishing for food and money. However, she has seen changes in the ocean too. There are fewer and smaller fish in the sea. It is also getting more difficult to catch fish, because of strong winds. At this time, her family have been unable to catch fish for five months and because of this, they try to catch shrimp instead. Sometimes they do not have enough and have to borrow food from neighbours. If given a choice, she would like to live on the high land and then go to the sea for fishing. However, her family does not have any savings, and could not afford to buy land. It costs around 7,000 Peso ($147). Now her family is using whatever is available ­ palm leaves and wood ­ to slowly rebuild their house on the original concrete ground. The photo shows that it is not a very strong shelter for protecting her family. If there was another big typhoon, then the house might easily fall down. Since typhoon, fewer households live along the coast. Bredin says tree planting along the coast may help protect against the typhoon. Sand bags are also another option to prevent the ocean waves from hitting their fragile houses.

Non-negotiable science

Already, rapid changes in the way our planet works are surprising the experts. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are growing faster than scientific models predicted just ten years ago. Ice sheets are melting faster, suggesting that feedback mechanisms, which could lead to runaway climate change, are already in motion. While policy makers continue to assume that a halving of global emissions by 2050 can avoid catastrophic levels of climate change, the recent scientific findings suggest this goal falls far short of what is needed.3 The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a 6°C temperature increase on current trends.4 This would result in unimaginable human suffering and socioeconomic collapse.

In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presented its review of emissions pathways. The lowest scenarios available then, however, did not indicate emissions levels consistent with staying within 2°C of warming, widely considered to represent the threshold of irreversible climate change5 (see Table 1).

As the current concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere today exceeds 430 parts per million (CO2e ­ Carbon Dioxide Equivalent), we are already in the danger zone. `Tipping elements' such as the reduction in Arctic summer sea ice are already evident, underlining the urgent need to reduce emissions, starting now.

Minimising poor people's risks
Scientists urgently need to set out what emissions pathways consistent with a high probability of limiting warming well within 2°C (above preindustrial temperatures) would look like. Until this information is available, the only tolerable strategy is to minimise the risks that poor

7

`The costs of stabilising the climate are significant but manageable; delay would be dangerous and much more costly.'
Stern Review12

people face first on the basis of the most recent scientific findings. Adopting emissions reductions goals that are more ambitious even than the lowest IPCC-reviewed scenarios assessed (Row 2 in Table 1) is not a point for negotiation ­ it is a starting point from which the negotiations must proceed.
More ambitious emissions reductions targets mean poor people will face fewer risks of hunger, ill health, insecurity, and death. In response to the latest science ­ and in order to protect their people from irreversible and catastrophic levels of climate change ­ 92 of the nations most vulnerable to climate change have called for global warming to be kept within 1.5°C.6 Together with most organisations dedicated to humanitarian causes, Oxfam's concern lies in avoiding a reverse in human development ­ and preserving a climate that makes poor people's efforts to escape poverty possible.7
To minimise risks associated with a greater than 2°C temperature rise, GHGs in the atmosphere must be reduced to below 400ppm CO2e as a matter of urgency, decreasing to a concentration of 350ppm as soon as possible thereafter. Scientists have calculated this level as 'very likely' to keep the temperature increase within 1.5°C.8
At Bali in 2007, the world's governments set December 2009 as the deadline to agree a global deal on climate change.9 To fend off disaster, the agreement in Copenhagen will need to ensure that global emissions peak by 2015 at the very latest10, and that total global emissions in 2020 fall back to 1990 levels ­ or even lower.11
While even this ambitious level of mitigation action cannot guarantee a `safe' climate, it is the minimum requirement for an adequate mitigation goal ­ one that minimises risks to poor people around the world, and preserves their options for a better life.
Delaying action, by substituting ambitious near-term targets with more ambitious action in the long term (post-2020) is to dance with disaster: analysis has shown that a delay in emissions reductions of ten years almost doubles our chance of exceeding 2°C of warming.13
Time is running out. We face a small and shrinking window of opportunity to put ourselves on a pathway to prevent catastrophic climate change. The Copenhagen UN climate conference in December 2009 represents a last chance to change course.

Fair deal or none

Equity is a vital and instrumental part of any agreement to be reached in Copenhagen. No country will agree to a post-2012 climate regime it perceives to be unfair. An agreement that simply maintains, or worse increases, existing injustice and inequality, is unacceptable.

The existing inequalities of climate change are stark:
· Developed countries are responsible for approximately 76 per cent of the GHG emissions already released into the atmosphere;14
· Per capita rates of GHG emissions are significantly higher in developed countries than developing countries. For example an average Australian emits nearly 5 times as much as an average Chinese, and the average Canadian emits 13 times as much as the average Indian;
· About 100 countries, with a total population of nearly a billion people but less than 3 per cent of the global emissions, will have to suffer the effects of climate change impacts in the near term;
· Developed countries have greater economic capability to make the adjustments that are needed to reduce emissions. For instance, the US GDP per person is about 10 times that of China and about 19 times that of India.15

Climate Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol to assist the most vulnerable countries in their most urgent climate adaptation needs, rich-country contributions to the Least Developed Countries Fund add-up to less than 10 per cent of these urgent needs;16
· Several Annex 1 countries remain off course to achieve their modest reductions targets under the Kyoto Protocol17, and Canada has even suggested it will not bother;
· Progress by the G8 countries towards their commitment at the Gleaneagles Summit in 2005 ­ to provide an additional $50 billion in development aid by 2010, and make steady progress towards achieving the 0.7 per cent GNI target set in 1972 ­ has stalled in most countries, and even threatens to roll backwards overall;
· The Doha Development Round has now all but lost any promise of delivering for development, and, despite warm words, rich countries are yet to deliver more than a fraction of the $13 billion needed by the tens of millions of people suffering from the food crisis.
A fair deal in Copenhagen has several dimensions including: resources for adaptation in developing countries; a means to redress damages from climate impacts; and policy responses that do not themselves harm poor people's lives and livelihoods. Of all the dimensions of equity, agreeing fair shares of an adequate global mitigation goal is central. Without a fair division of the global mitigation effort, there is no deal.
What's fair?
Responsibility and capability for fair shares
The principles of responsibility and capability are enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and in the Kyoto Protocol (see sidebar). But although this principle is the most widely quoted passage from the Convention, governments are further than ever from defining what it means in concrete terms.19
As indicated in Table 1 in Section 1, the IPCC correlated reductions of 25­40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 in Annex 1 countries to stabilisation of temperatures between 2.0­2.4°C.20 If we are to keep warming as far below 2°C as possible, it follows that Annex 1 countries must adopt the most stringent target proposed by the IPCC at the very least ­ and accept substantial additional obligations to finance mitigation in non-Annex 1 countries (see next section). Accordingly, the Copenhagen agreement must enshrine aggregate reductions of at least 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 for Annex 1 countries, and guarantee their delivery through binding, individual country targets for Annex 1 countries, a majority of which must be achieved through domestic action.21,22

10

Within the Annex 1 group there is a wide range of responsibility for climate change and the harm it causes, and the capacity to take action to reduce emissions. In accordance with the key principles of responsibility and capability, and on the basis of principles of fairness and social justice, Oxfam believes that an explicit, principle-based framework for determining the mitigation targets and other obligations of Annex 1 countries is the most transparent and objective way to determine what is fair. Together with several other Parties and observers, Oxfam proposes that a responsibility-capability index be agreed as a reference point for the negotiations.23

Oxfam has analysed what represents a fair share of emissions reductions for each Annex 1 country taking into account both their history of past emissions and their current levels of income. Based on an indicator constructed using cumulative emissions, 1990­2005, for responsibility, and total income above a `development threshold' for capability, Oxfam's analysis of Annex I fair shares suggests that more than 95 per cent of this Annex I target falls to just six countries and groups. (For more detail, see Appendix 1.) These figures do not represent an analysis of specific mitigation policy options in these countries.

For these six, the 2020 emissions targets (in relation to 1990 levels) are as follows: Australia (40 per cent), Canada (43 per cent), the EU (44 per cent), Japan (52 per cent), Russia24 (20 per cent), and the USA (45 per cent). Appendix 2 sets out the emissions targets for some Annex 1 countries. These targets are substantially higher than any currently contemplated by Annex 1 countries so far, and show the extent of the political challenge Annex 1 countries must rise to if we are to secure the future of our planet.
Indeed, there are powerful equity arguments, given the history, that for rich countries the allowance should be zero (which would mean that it would have to pay for all the actual greenhouse gases emitted), or even negative.
Lord Nicholas Stern25

Fair shares in a global context
While the foregoing section allocates equitable shares across Annex I, it does not say that a 40 per cent reduction below 1990 levels by 2020 satisfies the overall responsibility and capability of rich countries in a global context. Indeed, there are many good reasons to conclude that the fair share of Annex I countries involves much more.
Applying measures of responsibility and capability globally, the Greenhouse Development Rights framework assigns more than three quarters of the total, required global effort to developed countries in 2010. Assuming a 2°C pathway, this correlates to obligations for developed countries significantly higher than the often-quoted 25­40 per cent range of rich-country reductions by 2020. For example, under this approach, the EU faces a global mitigation obligation that is equivalent to a reduction of its emissions by almost 80 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020.26
Likewise, a recent submission to the UN negotiations by Bolivia outlines a `carbon debt' approach that calculates historic emissions of rich and developing countries in relation to per capita emissions. Extrapolating into the future and taking account of emissions constraints, the submission concludes: `To the extent it is not technically possible to repay the full measure of debt in terms of environmental space, some part may need to be repaid by Annex I countries in the form of financing and technology... an ambitious package of financial and technological transfers is clearly required from Annex I Countries to help developing countries reduce their emissions without undermining development. `27
Rich countries are unlikely to deliver their fair share of global mitigation action through their own domestic emissions cuts. Assuming 40 per cent reductions by 2020, Annex I countries will still remain well above average global per capita emissions levels, and will therefore owe a large portion of their fair share. Assuming a global carbon budget in 2020 equal to 1990 levels, a 40 per cent reduction for Annex I would translate to an allocation of 11.7 Gigatonnes (Gt), or approximately 9.2 tonnes per person using today's population.28 The consequences of such an allocation for Annex 1 countries would be that the residual allocation of 24.4 Gt for developing countries adds up to just half, or 4.6 Gt per person ­ and far less were we to use projected 2020 population data. This would be highly unfair. Such allocations have considerable financial implications. Assuming a 2 tonne per person allowance and a low ($25/tonne) carbon price, Annex I countries would owe some $229bn in 2020 ­ even after having reduced their emissions by 40 per cent relative to 1990 levels.
Overcoming the classic stalemate
A stalemate plagues the UN climate negotiations. One in which rich countries argue developing countries must make emissions-reductions

12

commitments before developed countries have made good on their commitment to take action first and fastest, and have provided long overdue funding. Developing countries argue, rightly, that they cannot take the same kinds of commitments until these previously made promises from developed countries are met. In light of deep inequalities, past and present, and broken promises, it is neither fair nor realistic for rich countries to expect developing countries to commit to binding national emissions-reductions targets before wealthy developed nations have made deep, lasting cuts and commitment to specific levels of funding. These should be in line with what was agreed in the Bali Action Plan, in order to prevent catastrophic climate change.
Until developed countries take a leadership role consistent with their responsibility for emitting the vast majority of the atmospheric buildup of CO2 over the last century, and show that economic well-being and welfare can be maintained while drastically cutting emissions, developing countries cannot be expected to take the same level of action as developed countries. Countries such as the UK and Germany have shown that it is possible to maintain economic growth while reducing emissions; other developed countries must also set this example.
Yet even if industrialised countries were to cease all emissions from today, developing-country emissions alone would overshoot the 2°C pathway by 2020 on current trends.29 We now face a far greater climate challenge than when the Kyoto Protocol was first agreed over 10 years ago. Unbridled emissions growth in developing countries is no longer an option.
A pathway to keep warming well within 2°C demands both that emissions in industrialised countries are reduced, well below the 1990 baseline adopted by the UN Climate Convention, and that emissions growth in developing countries be limited below `business-as-usual' trajectories.
Too often, the question of fair shares focuses exclusively on what countries ­ industrialised or developing ­ must each do to help avoid dangerous climate change. This is critical (as we have seen above) ­ but is only half the story. Focusing solely on this issue tends to perpetuate the classic stalemate ­ the `north-south divide' or impasse ­ that has characterised international climate talks for years now. Each side calls for the other to move first, and uses intransigence as an excuse for inaction. With every tick of the Copenhagen countdown clock, the cost of this classic stalemate rises.
The agreement struck in Bali in December 200730 clearly sets the parameters for the nature of developing-country action and for the support from rich countries required to increase the reductions in emissions that can be made in developing countries. The next commitment period that is agreed in Copenhagen needs to be a trustbuilding period that, as Stern argues, `...rewards developing countries for reducing emissions, but does not punish them for failing to do so'.31
13

Section 3 explores a model for overcoming this stalemate, and ensuring that we reach a positive outcome from the Copenhagen meeting.

The means in the middle

Ultimately, we will only escape the carbon trap as a result of cooperative efforts, in which rich countries take on a double duty to both reduce their domestic emissions, and enable developing countries to undertake a rapid and large-scale transition to a low carbon future.
This is true, not only because of the international politics of climate change in 2009, but also because of the simple maths of the emissions reductions required. A return to 1990 annual emissions levels by 2020 is the very minimum that would reduce the risks of overshooting 2°C below 50 per cent.32 If Annex I achieves a 40 per cent reduction at home, a reduction of approximately the same scale (in tonnes of CO2e) in developing countries ­ achieved by limiting the growth of emissions rather than by reducing emissions in absolute terms ­ will still be required to keep warming below 2°C.33 (As discussed above, equity requires that the reductions in emissions growth be paid for largely by Annex 1 countries.)
Box 2: `Autonomous' action in China
In June 2007, the Chinese Government released `China's National Climate Change Programme'. It also established the National Climate Change Coordination Committee. Climate change work is led by Premier Wen Jiabao. In November 2008 a white paper, `China's Policies and Actions for Addressing Climate Change', was published. Highlights include:
Improving energy efficiency
China has reduced the energy intensity of GDP by over 60 per cent since 1980, and has set a target to reduce it by a further 20 per cent by 2010 (against 2005 levels).
Since 2005, the Government has required all new large power plants to use high-efficiency super-critical coal fired technology and, during 2007, 553 smaller inefficient plants with total generating capacity of 14.38GW were shut down.
Increasing investment in renewable energy
Ambitious policy and renewable energy targets: 15 per cent of total energy should come from renewable sources by 2020.
$50bn out of the $580bn economic stimulus package will be invested in environmental protection and low carbon development.
China is the world's second largest investor (in absolute terms) in renewable energy ­ in 2007 China invested approximately $12bn in renewable energy, behind Germany, which invested $14bn. Every two hours, China installs a wind turbine. By 2012, it plans to be the world leader in wind energy.
There are strong policies to stop deforestation and to promote sustainable forest management. There are also policies to adapt to climate change in agriculture, forest and other natural ecological systems, water resources, as well as to protect ecologically fragile areas.

Unilateral, `autonomous' actions already announced by developing countries (see Box 2 above), can be expected to deliver some of the necessary global reductions, but are not likely to approach the scale required. If Annex I countries commit to, and deliver, a 40 per cent reduction from 1990 levels by 2020, then emissions growth in developing countries as a whole (compared to 1990) will need to be limited to the same amount. This would still result in a doubling of emissions in developing countries compared to 1990 levels).34 In other words, the amount of emissions reductions that must be achieved in addition to the 40 per cent rich-country target is still very large indeed.
The EU has called for a reduction in developing countries equivalent to a 15­30 per cent reduction below business-as-usual by 2020. This is based on an estimate of the remaining carbon budget after a 25­40 per cent reduction by Annex 1.35 While estimating `business-as-usual' emissions trajectories is a tricky business, what is clear is that the size of the reduction that must be achieved in the developing world will depend in large part on what Annex I countries ultimately commit to achieve; if it is greater than 40 per cent below 1990 levels, then the reduction in developing countries required by a 2°C-consistent pathway will be less, as will the financial resources required from developed countries to finance this reduction. Likewise, it will also depend on economic growth rates in developing countries, and the extent to which these are de-coupled from emissions.
A mechanism to match the required finance from rich countries with the mitigation actions from developing countries is not only necessary to achieve the global mitigation requirement, it is also consistent with agreement reached between countries under UN negotiations in Bali in December 2007. Such a mechanism must become a central focus of negotiations and a centrepiece of the Copenhagen deal.
Oxfam proposes a Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism to ensure that developing countries are provided with support and incentives in line with rich countries' responsibility for historic emissions and their ability to pay. One feature of the proposal is that support should be provided in relation to developing countries' `available economic capability'. That is, countries with very low capability should be provided with the most support, and countries with higher capability should receive less.
Oxfam analysis suggests that a meaningful way of assessing available economic capability is to count only the portion of a country's gross national income (GNI) above a threshold of $9,000 per person, per year. Research suggests that $6,000 per year can be considered a `global poverty line' ­ a level of income that corresponds to what is generally considered poverty in nearly all countries around the world.36 Many analysts agree that a development threshold should be set well above this poverty line.37 Our assessment is that a level of income that is 50 per cent greater than the poverty line, or $9,000, serves as a meaningful development threshold ­ the point at which most people can be considered not only to have escaped poverty, but further to enjoy economic, social, and political rights and freedoms that give rise to
16

responsibilities for active global citizenship.
Oxfam's approach to determining available economic capability starts by excluding entirely from a country's GNI, the income of all individuals in a country earning less than the equivalent of $9,000 per year. For individuals earning more than $9,000 per year, only the portion above this threshold is considered. Whilst income below the threshold is generally directed to survival and development priorities, income above the threshold is a reasonable proxy for a country's economic capability `available' for other uses ­ including contributing to urgent action on global climate change. As it's the amount that needs to provide for the priorities of a society as a whole, we divide this amount by total population to reflect available economic capability in per person terms.
If they wish to receive this support, developing countries (those that are not least developed countries [LDCs] or small-island developing states [SIDS]38 or countries with very low capability, as outlined in Appendix 3), should produce a national mitigation plan, identifying the nationally appropriate mitigation actions that the country proposes; the incremental costs of these actions; and the tonnes of carbon saved as a result of taking the actions.
An important feature of this Mechanism is that, properly implemented, it ensures that there is no double counting of reductions delivered in Annex 1 countries and those delivered in non-Annex 1 countries. Both of these reductions must be achieved in order to keep warming as far below 2°C as possible, and both require leadership from rich countries.
Additionally, this Mechanism ensures that low cost emissionsreductions options in developing countries are accounted for in their national mitigation plans, and their national communications to the UNFCCC (rather than counting towards Annex I obligations and so reducing their costs). It does so by providing developing countries a huge incentive to realise emissions reductions up to a pre-determined target level. After the target reductions are achieved, additional reductions can be sold to firms in rich countries for whom the price is competitive with options they face in their domestic context. The section below describes this proposal in greater detail (see also Figure 2 for a schematic representation).
17

Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism
How it would work
Economy-wide nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMA)
In order to receive funding, developing countries would create and submit a national mitigation plan, outlining a series of nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). The national mitigation plan would identify the mitigation actions that the country proposes, the incremental costs of these actions,39 and the tonnes of carbon emissions that will be avoided (reduced) as a result.
For countries with available, per-person economic capability of $1,000 or higher,40 in order to receive funding, the national mitigation plan should be economy-wide.
The governing body of the Mechanism should determine the appropriate level of emissions reductions that developing countries should strive to achieve. Once identified, this level of mitigation should be used to determine the amount of mitigation that will be funded through the Mechanism in each developing country, taking into account the levels of incentives provided, as described below. This could be a single percentage reduction (relative to business-as-usual) for all developing countries, or different levels for specific categories.
In any case, the target level for developing-country NAMAs must be determined with reference to the amount of reductions necessary to minimise risks of warming beyond 2°C. The figure of 15­30 per cent below business-as-usual that the EU has proposed, needs further scrutiny for several reasons: more clarity about the level of ambition reflected in rich-country targets is a starting point; assuming rich countries commit to a 40 per cent below 1990 reduction by 2020, a 15­30 per cent reduction from business-as-usual corresponds to levels of warming greater than 2°C; only a handful of experts have published relevant estimates.41
The Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism would assess the technical quality of national mitigation plans that developing countries submit, and ­ provided agreed standards are satisfied ­ would transfer funding in line with an incentive schedule agreed by its governing body. Oxfam suggests that available economic capability (as described above and in Appendix 3) is a relevant and meaningful basis for determining the level of financial incentive provided to enable developing-country action, as follows:
· LDCs, SIDS,42 and countries with available economic capability of less than $1,000 per person receive full (100 per cent) support for the incremental costs of any emissions reductions projects, even if not part of a comprehensive or economy-wide national mitigation plan;43
18

· Countries with per-person available capacity greater than $1,000 and lower than $12,000 receive a proportion of the incremental cost of funding for all actions within their national mitigation plans, depending upon their available economic capability. A sliding scale of support could match the proportion of financed incremental costs. For reference, data for all countries in this category is provided in Table 5, Appendix 3.
· Countries with capacity greater than $12,000 are encouraged to take on economy-wide efforts to reach the emissions reduction level identified by the Mechanism as being necessary to keep warming as far below 2°C as possible.
Premium Reductions
Developing countries may submit plans that deliver emissions reductions above the minimum level of mitigation identified and agreed by the Mechanism. Because these reductions are additional to the level of reductions needed to minimise risks of catastrophic climate change, these additional, or `premium', reductions may be purchased44 by Annex I country actors to `offset' emissions that would be more expensive to reduce at home, or through emissions trading with other Annex 1 countries and carbon markets.
Because these premium reductions are over and above the large scale of incentivised reductions, they are likely to be more expensive. 100 per cent of the cost of these reductions should be funded for all developing countries with capability of less than $12,000. The increased cost should be reflected in the price calculated for premium reductions, as identified below.
Securing new, additional, adequate, and predictable funding
Beginning as soon as possible, the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism should provide finance for countries with low levels of capability in order that all developing countries have the capacity to develop:
· national mitigation plans;
· a rigorous emissions inventory and database;
· systems required for participation, including governance systems.
The Mechanism should sell, auction or levy all or a portion of Assigned Amount Units (AAUs)45 to Annex I countries (up to the total allocation represented by their respective targets) as a primary means of generating a predictable revenue flow (other sources might also be used).
In all cases, the price would need to be managed by the Mechanism to ensure that sufficient money is raised to pay for the cost of necessary reductions in developing countries. For example, if an auction is chosen as the preferred approach, a price floor could be set. If a levy were used, the amount of AAUs set aside would need to take account of price risks
19

in the carbon market. In the case of a managed sale, a country that had emissions of 500 megatonnes (Mt) in 1990 and takes a 40 per cent target by 2020, would buy 300 million tonnes worth of AAUs (60 per cent of 500 Mt) at the price determined by the Mechanism to satisfy the scale of non-Annex I reductions required by the global carbon budget.
On no account should the price of premium reduction units be set low enough to act as a price ceiling within domestic emissions-trading schemes in Annex I countries. This would undermine efforts to reduce emissions in Annex I countries first and fastest. The UNFCCC Mitigation and Finance Mechanism should also take into account the price and forward price for permits within the Kyoto-compliant emissions-trading schemes around the world.
Box 2: A primer on emissions permits and trading
Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) are the measures for targets or `allowed' emissions from Annex I countries, and represent one tonne of GHG emissions. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I members are currently provided AAUs at no cost by the UNFCCC ­ up to the level allowed by their agreed target. They can then be traded by sovereign states through countryto-country emissions trading.
Emissions trading schemes within countries or regions do not use AAUs. Instead, they create other units in order to allow trade between firms. Country-to-country carbon trading is currently made up primarily of trade in AAUs, and both countries and companies can purchase credits known as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).
The CDM is a project-based mechanism designed to provide incentives for emissions reductions and sustainable development in developing countries. Many national and regional level emissions-trading schemes, such as the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) currently allow CERs to be traded as credits within the scheme.
Oxfam proposes that all or a portion of AAUs should be sold, auctioned or levied in the post-2012 period by the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism ­ instead of allocated to countries for free. Under this proposal, CERs would effectively be replaced by premium reductions, available for purchase by both states and firms to meet national targets (under the international regime) or cover emissions under domestic cap-and-trade programmes.
The target amount of financing required should include funds for the incremental cost of national mitigation plans of developing countries to the assessed mitigation level; the costs of any required capacitybuilding (for eligible countries); and a small transaction levy in order to fund the functioning of the Mechanism and its governing body. Because other financing needs in developing countries also require new additional, adequate, and predictable financing, arrangements for generating revenues from the sale, auction or levy of AAUs will also need to account for the costs of adaptation to the impacts of climate change in developing countries. See Table 3, below for an indication of the scale of funding required, in the order of at least $150 billion per
20

year. Finally, the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism will require a strong governance structure, with majority representation of developing-country stakeholders (like the current Adaptation Fund).46 It will also require high-level expertise (for technical assessments), immunity rules similar to those of the CDM Executive Board, and sufficient resources for administration. It should report to the relevant meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC.47 The IPCC and other expert bodies as well as subsidiary bodies to the Convention should provide advice to the UNFCCC Mitigation and Finance Mechanism.48
Options for Annex 1 countries
Under the proposed Mechanism, Annex 1 countries would acquire their AAUs from the Mechanism at the determined rate (as above). In the event that an Annex I country has reduced emissions beyond its target, and therefore has surplus AAUs, it may sell those AAUs to another Annex 1 country (just as under the Kyoto Protocol). The majority of Annex I targets must be met through domestic action. In the event that an Annex 1 country is not able to meet its target domestically or through emissions trading amongst Annex 1 countries, it will have the option of buying premium reduction units from the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism. Corporations would also able to buy premium reduction units from the Mechanism, provided this is allowed within the relevant national or regional emissions trading scheme. Each year Annex I countries would provide an accounting to the UNFCCC that shows they have sufficient AAUs and (if required) premium reduction units to cover their annual emissions levels. Any discrepancy must be made up with the equivalent amount of premium reduction units.
21

Schematic key:
AAUs Assigned amount units (AAUs) are the unit by which Annex 1 countries receive their GHG allowance, or budget. One AAU = one tonne of GHG emissions. For example if a country who has emissions levels of 500Mt in 1990, receives a target to reduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2020, it would have an allowance of 300Mt of GHG emissions and would receive 300 million AAUs.
COP The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the annual meeting of the UNFCCC at which all Governments who have ratified the UNFCCC and are therefore Parties to the Convention attend and can speak. It is typically held for two weeks in December each year, and the CMP is held concurrently.
CMP The Conference of the Parties acting as the Meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol (CMP or COPMOP) is held in conjunction with the COP. It is a meeting for countries who have ratified the Kyoto Protocol.
NAMA Nationally appropriate mitigation action
REDD Reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation in developing countries (REDD) is an area of the climate negotiations that deals with how developing countries will reduce deforestation and degradation (logging) and therefore reduce their emissions of GHGs.

What would it take?

To achieve a deal in Copenhagen, richer countries must facilitate mitigation efforts in developing countries by contributing finance, technology, and capacity-building support. This is not aid; rather it is part of rich countries' fair share of the global mitigation effort. The extent of mitigation actions by developing countries will be directly related to, and largely contingent upon, such support.

Reliable finance is required for both mitigation and adaptation ­ they are equally important. Estimates of the costs of mitigation and adaptation, listed in Table 3 below, indicate that a range of between $110­180bn per year of public finance will be required in order for developing countries to reduce emissions and adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.

The majority of these estimates are based on assumptions that will lead to warming higher than 2°C, in some cases up to 3°C. Because keeping warming as far within 2°C as possible is a matter of life or death for poor people, we can expect that mitigation costs will be at the high end of the estimates in the table ­ and likely even far greater. Oxfam believes that rich-country governments need to plan on making at least $150 billion per year in public finance available to the international climate regime by 2013. Because adaptation resources are needed now, the negotiations towards an agreement in Copenhagen should further ensure that arrangements for large-scale funding are put in place even sooner.

For comparative purposes, developed-country governments have spent more than $4 trillion in the last year (at the time of writing) on bailouts of financial services companies,49 and in 2007 the world's governments spent $1.3 trillion on military expenditure, with approximately $1 trillion spent by developed countries.50
immediately Adaptation 50

There have been several suggested approaches to raising these funds. Few of these proposals raise enough, however. The approaches that are gaining the most currency in the international negotiations are:
· The Mexico Proposal includes establishing a World Climate Change Fund, to which countries contribute, based on criteria such as their GHG emissions, population, and GDP. It aims to raise $10bn in the initial phase. All countries could withdraw money from the fund for mitigation activities, such as reforestation and and avoided deforestation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy. Eligible activities would range from the project level to the sectoral level.61
· Norway has suggested auctioning a percentage of the AAUs that countries are currently given for free from the UNFCCC. Two per cent auctioning could raise $15­25bn per year.62 Oxfam has previously estimated that auctioning 7.5 per cent of allowances would generate $52bn per year.63
· Tuvalu has proposed an emissions trading scheme for international aviation and maritime emissions. This could raise $28bn per year.64 Oxfam has previously estimated that contributions from international aviation and maritime emissions could raise $29bn per year.65
· The group of developing countries in the climate negotiations (G77/China) has called on developed countries to provide 0.5­1 per

24

cent of their Gross National Product for adaptation and mitigation action in developing countries, additional to official development assistance (ODA).66 This equates to approximately $201­402 bn.67
The proposals by Mexico and Norway incorporate some elements of the key principles of responsibility and capability, but (as currently envisioned) do not raise enough money. The group of developing countries' proposal raises the scale of funds required, but has an emphasis on capacity over responsibility, and lacks a mechanism to reliably generate the funds (thus being in danger of not providing the predictability of funds required to allow developing countries to undertake mitigation plans). Whether or not any specific proposal now on the negotiating table is perfect, what is clear is that there are options that can reliably generate the scale of resources required.
A related consideration is the extent to which revenue-generation mechanisms, structure incentives to ensure global emissions reductions are achieved through one means or another. The proposed Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism has the virtue of ensuring that the polluter pays; those countries with low emissions-reductions targets would need to acquire more AAUs. Whether through sale, auction or levy, tying the scale of resources required to the volume of AAUs acquired helps ensure that sufficient resources are raised to provide the incentives and support the developing world needs to step-up contributions to global mitigation efforts. For rich countries, this could mean flexibility ­ to either increase the ambition of emissions reductions-targets or pay for more emissions permits (AAUs).
Another appealing feature of the Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism is that it reverses the current incentive structure for mitigation action (under the Clean Development Mechanism), which results in large incentives for countries with higher capability, and few if any incentives for the poorest countries. By ensuring that the poorest countries are provided with full support for any mitigation actions they undertake, the Mechanism proposed helps ensure a low carbon future with less, rather than more, economic inequality.
Most importantly, every proposed model is academic until, and unless, rich countries take up the leadership role they committed to when the UN climate convention was signed more than 15 years ago. With many models to choose from, rich countries are clearly lacking the will, rather than the way, to make progress in the current negotiations and ensure that all countries hang together in confronting the climate challenge.

Recommendations
2009 is a make or break year for climate change. We have the opportunity to set in place a new deal to ensure that we prevent catastrophic climate change while not exacerbating existing global inequalities. Acting now will be less costly than delaying action.
The new deal proposed in this paper has two core components: deep emissions cuts from developed countries; and financial assistance from developed countries for developing countries to reduce their emissions and to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change. Oxfam calls for the following recommendations to form part of an effective global climate plan to be agreed in December 2009 at Copenhagen:
· The negotiations should establish the objective of keeping global warming well within 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and acknowledge that with as little as a 1.5°C increase, the survival of many vulnerable countries and poor communities will be threatened.
· The target for GHGs in the atmosphere needs to be set below 400ppm CO2e as a matter of urgency, decreasing to a concentration of 350ppm as soon as possible thereafter.
· A deal must reflect countries' historical responsibility for emissions and their economic capability.
· Binding individual Annex 1 country targets must be set, based on principles of responsibility and capability. These binding targets must deliver at least 40 per cent reductions below 1990 levels by 2020 for Annex 1 countries as a group. The majority of these reductions must be met through domestic action.
· A Global Mitigation and Finance Mechanism must be established to ensure the required finance from rich countries ­ $150bn per year as an absolute minimum ­ enables necessary mitigation and adaptation actions in developing countries.
· Annex I countries must agree to provide sufficient and reliable funding for capacity-building, mitigation, and adaptation (at least $50 billion per year), through the sale, auction or levy of all or a portion of their emissions allowances (AAUs).
· Developing countries ­ apart from least developed countries, small island developing states68 and countries with available economic capability of less than $1,000 per person ­ should agree to create and submit a national mitigation plan in return for financial incentives for mitigation action.
· A national mitigation plan should identify the nationally appropriate mitigation actions that the country proposes; the incremental costs of the actions; and the tonnes of carbon saved

as a result of taking the actions. · Countries with available capacity of more than $1,000 per
person that wish to receive funding, should ensure their national mitigation plan is economy-wide and delivers reductions up to the agreed target threshold as a minimum. · LDCs, SIDS,69 and countries with available capacity of less than $1,000 per person should not be required to submit a national mitigation plan, but should receive 100 per cent of the incremental cost of funding for specific mitigation projects submitted. · Developing countries must receive funding for their national mitigation plans, adaptation, and capacity-building proportional to their economic capacity as outlined in Section 3.

People report more frequent and intense flooding, which in turn accelerates river erosion ­ threatening their homes and livelihoods. Oxfam and our partners are helping communities to understand, prepare for, and adapt to changing weather. 2 Trustees' Report Introduction

Chair's introduction
Oxfam doesn't stand still from one year to the next. We are continually learning from experience and applying these lessons to our humanitarian, development and campaigning work. Of course, the world we're working in doesn't stand still either. Climate change, the global food crisis and now the global economic crisis are creating new and serious threats to people's efforts to overcome poverty. They also make Oxfam's work more relevant ­ and more urgent ­ than ever.

Climate change
During the year, in the lead-up to the era-defining climate negotiations which will take place in Copenhagen in December 2009, Oxfam continued raising awareness of, and mobilising action on, the human cost of climate change. Our Here & Now campaign, which launched in April 2009, is calling on the UK Government to push for a fair and safe deal at the talks. The solution needs to involve rapid and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from wealthy nations. It also needs to focus on supporting poor countries as they adapt to the already inevitable effects of climate change.
As always, our campaigning is backed up by our experiences working with communities at the sharp end of climate change. We help people to reduce the impact of floods and storms, and to adapt their lives and livelihoods to increasingly unpredictable weather patterns which are playing havoc with traditional farming systems. And, as natural disasters are set to increase in frequency and severity, we're gearing up our humanitarian programme to respond (pages 15-19).
Over the course of the year, Oxfam has experienced difficulties in reaching the people who need our help most. In January, following the Israeli offensive on Gaza, the continuing blockade severely hampered the provision of emergency food and medical supplies. In March 2009, Oxfam was among 15 aid agencies expelled from northern Sudan, where we were providing humanitarian assistance to 600,000 people. Our aid programmes were also temporarily suspended in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. This is an extremely worrying trend, particularly given the expected increase in natural disasters brought on by changing climates.
The impact of the recession
By constantly evolving and developing, facing new challenges and taking advantage of new opportunities, Oxfam strives to make the biggest possible impact on the greatest number of people. This means looking inward too ­ at the shape of our organisation, at how we structure ourselves and prioritise our work. At the same time, the global economic crisis is having a devastating

effect on the people we work with, pushing millions of people into, or deeper into, poverty. Unsurprisingly, we have not been immune from the effects of this. Income from regular donors is down slightly, and the falling value of the pound means the money we raise in the UK does not go as far as it used to. This means we have to use our resources even more effectively, reducing our costs and activities where we can, and investing in key areas.
From the beginning of this financial year, that has meant anticipating the impact of the economic downturn and looking at how we can save money while becoming `fit for the future'. Regrettably, this has involved making just over 60 redundancies in the UK. We've also had to take the painful decision to cut back our work in several countries. This is happening in a carefully planned way, starting in 2010, so that we can safeguard what has already been achieved and ensure local organisations are in the best possible position to carry on the work independently.
`National Change Strategies' (NCS) have also been an important part of this process. During the year, country teams completed these after being challenged to consider `how change happens' in the bigger picture, and the role of Oxfam in contributing to this change. The resulting strategies include a new emphasis on the role of the state in achieving change, and (related to this) the need for Oxfam to focus on connecting our experience at community level with changes in national level policies and practice.
During the year, we also strengthened our commitment to building an international anti-poverty movement through Oxfam International and our other alliances. Oxfam GB continues to play a full role in the development of a broader confederation, which includes two new members, Oxfam Mexico and Oxfam India.

Introduction Trustees' Report 3

Oxfam's unique approach
This Trustees' Report is structured around the rights which form the basis of Oxfam's approach, and reports back on the 11 corporate objectives which we set ourselves last year. These objectives do not cover all of Oxfam's work, they are simply the key areas where it was agreed that we needed to deliver or develop. Within these aims and objectives, there are underlying `givens' on the way we work. These include putting women's rights at the heart of all we do, and accountability to our stakeholders (see pages 37­38).
This report not only demonstrates Oxfam's ability to evolve and adapt; it also highlights the effectiveness of our `One Programme Approach', which combines humanitarian response, long-term development, and campaigning at community, national and global levels in order to bring about lasting change for poor people. Our high-level lobbying with governments and international policy-makers is only made possible by our experience on the ground, working with communities, grassroots movements and partners. Demonstrating good practice at community level lends weight to our local, national and international lobbying. It also helps to ensure that our work in communities is sustainable and success can be replicated.
Change doesn't come overnight or all at once, but every step of progress has a profound impact on ordinary people ­ such as the families who can now afford medicine, thanks to GlaxoSmithKline's new pricing policy (page 12), or the millions of girls who will benefit from the Yemeni Parliament's ruling against early marriage (page 26). Oxfam has made long-term contributions to these changes and others, which you can read about in this report. It is the continued support of the staff, donors, volunteers, trustees, partners and others in the UK and worldwide which makes this progress possible. As Chair of Oxfam, I thank every one of you for your contribution: your time, energy, loyalty, and passion to work for a world in which every person has a fairer and more equal chance in life.
John Gaventa Chair of Oxfam
Charitable objects
As stated in the Memorandum of Association, the objects for which Oxfam is established for the public benefit are:
· to prevent and relieve poverty and to protect the vulnerable, including through humanitarian intervention;
· to advance sustainable development; · to promote human rights and equality and diversity,
in particular where to do so contributes to the prevention and relief of poverty; in all cases working anywhere in the world.

Oxfam is working for a world in which every person has food and income security and the opportunity to earn a living in decent working conditions. Millions of people are being made vulnerable by climate change. People in poverty, who have done least to cause the problem, are being hit hardest. In 2008/09, Oxfam continued to push for urgent action on climate change. We also continued working with others ­ including the private sector ­ to shift the power imbalances in local, national and international markets which are the fundamental cause of poverty for millions of people.

""I appreciate the strong drive from Oxfam International and other international NGOs in encouraging the full engagement of the NGO community in the effort to ensure a comprehensive approach to food and nutrition security.""
David Nabarro, Coordinator of the UN System High Level Task Force for the Global Food Security Crisis

Objective We will increase Oxfam's support to enterprise development within poor communities, and develop links to the private sector, by:
1. Improving producers' access to markets
In 2008/09, we continued our Global Agricultural Scale-up programme, aiming to demonstrate how investing in small-scale agriculture and business has the potential to enable millions of people to overcome poverty. Oxfam works with a wide range of groups to find innovative and sustainable ways for producers to improve their income; to add value to their products; and to find new opportunities for growth in domestic and international markets. In addition to the programme's four core countries (India, Honduras, Tanzania and Ethiopia), 16 other countries reported progress on market access in agriculture.
During the year, we focused on learning from our experiences since the programme began in 2005. We held a global event where staff and partners from the four core countries shared experiences and strategies with representatives from 18 country programmes. Drawing on our breadth of experience ­ ranging from Fair Trade and the development of farmer organisations, through to direct engagement with companies and local governments ­ we synthesised lessons to apply to future work and to influence policy. Independent, mid-term

evaluations of three key livelihoods programmes were also carried out,1 both to assess our impact on communities and to enable us to learn from what has worked well and what hasn't.
In 2008/09, the Accenture Foundation committed £1.8m funding to enable the Global Agriculture Scale-up programme to deliver its ambitious plans over the next three years.
As part of Oxfam International (OI), we campaigned on food security and for investment in agriculture (particularly smallholder agriculture) and launched national activities in over ten countries. We made known the human impact of increased food prices and the need to reverse the trend that ignored agricultural development in poor countries at the world's own peril.
We successfully lobbied, with others, the High Level Task Force set up by the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon, aimed at tackling the global food crisis. The breadth of our experience on issues underpinning the food crisis ­ food security, trade, agriculture, social protection, and financing for development ­ and our ability to link global and local concerns and opportunities has enabled us to be highly effective in our advocacy. During the year, we published (as part of OI) three policy papers: The Time is Now (June 2008), Double Edged Prices (October 2008) and One Billion Hungry People (January 2009),2 which together called for global action on the food crisis, food security and agriculture.

Milk Aplenty, Haiti
Lèt Agogo (`Milk Aplenty') is a network of 13 community-owned dairies in Haiti. The business, which is supported by Oxfam's Enterprise Development Programme (EDP), is helping hundreds of dairy farming families to make a living. Farmers sell their milk direct to their local Lèt Agogo dairy, where it is processed and bottled, or made into yoghurt or cheese. A central hub coordinates marketing and sales for all the dairies: finding buyers, negotiating contracts and helping the dairies to restock.
The cooperative provides training on animal husbandry and milk production, and supplies cattle to women farmers. The Oxfam-funded purchase of 80,000 glass bottles enabled Lèt Agogo to win a contract to supply milk to state schools. An external evaluation of the Lèt Agogo programme showed that Oxfam's support is making a significant impact: milk yields have doubled and 89 per cent of farmers report higher annual earnings since joining the network.

Reaching new markets, Malawi

Just a few years ago, the people of Mnembo were surviving as subsistence farmers. Now they are growing cash crops, and selling to an international supplier.
Oxfam paid villagers to construct a network of irrigation canals, supplied seeds and fertiliser, and provided training in farming techniques and reaching new markets. The community now works cooperatively to harvest and sell their produce in bulk. Thanks to the newly irrigated land and better farming methods, families have been able to grow wheat, rice and tomatoes as well as the traditional maize and cassava. Mnembo is now a major supplier to the Mulanje Peak Canning Factory, which sells tinned tomato juice and tomato puree in supermarkets nationwide and beyond. Oxfam is now replicating the irrigation scheme across Malawi. Photo: Abbie Trayler-Smith

2. Piloting the Enterprise Development Programme in 11 countries
Oxfam's Enterprise Development Programme (EDP) is an initiative linking UK business individuals with promising social enterprises that we are already supporting. In 2008/09, the EDP funded small enterprises in seven countries: Indonesia, Haiti, El Salvador, St Lucia, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Russia and Liberia. The enterprises are mostly agricultural-related business activities, ranging from milk production to vanilla processing and sales.
We have secured £1.2m from investors, engaged leading UK businessmen and women, and established an effective model of operation in this innovative programme. We plan to expand to the target of 11 programmes in 2009/10.
3. Engaging with large-scale private-sector companies as a first step to influencing their practices
Large, powerful transnational companies and corp orations have an enormous impact on people living in poverty. Investing far more than governments can ever deliver through overseas aid, they have the potential to create new jobs and opportunities, generate wages for

buying more goods and services, spread value and risk, and teach important new skills. It's this power to affect lives that makes it essential Oxfam works with the private sector, and influences companies to improve their policies and practices when they source products.
In 2008/09, we started an in-depth feasibility study to assess how smallholder farmers can be integrated into the supply chains of a global multinational company. The company and Oxfam are exploring four locations ­ Azerbaijan, Tanzania, Honduras, and the Philippines ­ to see if the production, processing, and policy conditions are favourable. Meanwhile, we continued building and developing new private sector links, including the following:
· Staff and partners in India, Ethiopia, Honduras, St Lucia, Columbia and Tanzania engaged with large companies to facilitate links with smallholders.
· Through Sustainable Food Lab (a consortium of 70 food industry leaders and NGOs including Oxfam), opportunities were identified to engage with Unilever, Lafise, Sisco and Global Foods.
· We began to engage with the Sri Lanka Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry on issues relating to poverty and corporate responsibility.

8 Trustees' Report Right to a sustainable livelihood
""Oxfam's new campaign highlights why it is vital that we get an ambitious international climate change agreement at Copenhagen this year. The UK Government is at the forefront of efforts to achieve this."" Joan Ruddock MP, Department of Energy and Climate Change

Objective To ensure that international negotiations on climate change result in a fair global deal for poor people.
In December 2009, the international community meets in Copenhagen to set the rules on how countries respond to climate change. Their decisions will have massive implications for the millions of poor people already suffering the consequences of global warming.
During 2008/09, international negotiations moved at a slow pace, with rich countries allowing their policies to be distorted by special interest groups in the private sector and other powerful influences. This has been a crucial year in building the social movements and public pressure that we hope will lead to a fair and safe deal for poor people. We have done this by:
1. Promoting solutions
By showcasing developing countries' efforts to adapt to climate change, Oxfam highlighted the need for such solutions to be implemented on a global scale. We launched a series of `climate poverty' reports in five countries. In Vietnam,3 for example, Oxfam research highlighted how local-level disaster risk management programmes can significantly reduce people's vulnera bility to frequent or heavy flooding. In Uganda,4 our Turning up the Heat report gave Oxfam the opportunity to discuss national policy with the country's senior decision-makers. The report praised the government's National Adaptation Programme of Action but highlighted the need for further financial resources from the international community for effective implementation.
2. Influencing decision-makers
Oxfam is increasingly being recognised for our expertise in adaptation policy, after publishing a series of policy papers. Our report Climate Wrongs and Human Rights5 firmly established the issue of rich-country responsibility, and outlined a need for $50bn of adaptation financing every year. This figure has been widely quoted, including by governments and the United Nations.
The evidence from our reports, combined with powerful personal testimonies, has been used by Oxfam and partners throughout a series of global institutional meetings over the year, including the Japan G8 (July 2008), UN meetings in Ghana (September 2008), the Washington G20 meeting (November 2008), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate

Change (UNFCCC) meeting in Poland (December 2008) and the London G20 (April 2009).
In the UK, the Forecast for Tomorrow report6 rated businesses and government departments on how they are tackling climate change. Three of the UK's top companies (Co-op, Marks & Spencer, National Grid) wrote a letter with Oxfam to the Prime Minister ­ the first time companies had mentioned mid-term emissions targets ­ and linked a successful deal to adaptation financing.
3. Strengthening Southern influence
Throughout the year we worked with civil society partners in South Africa, Uganda (see above) and Bangladesh to support developing-country delegations and ensure that Southern voices are heard by decision-makers. In February 2009, Oxfam piloted a `climate hearing' in southern Bangladesh, where local people described the devastating impact of climate change on their daily lives. This was the first in a series of climate hearings which will take place in at least eight countries in 2009. The aim is to gather and document thousands of personal experiences to influence decision-makers both at national level and at the UNFCCC in Copenhagen.
4. Building public pressure
This year we continued to highlight the impact of climate change on the world's poorest people, in order to build the mass, popular mobilisation which will be necessary to achieve success in Copenhagen. In December 2008, Oxfam activists gained widespread, international media coverage at the climate negotiations in Poland. In April 2009, we launched the Here & Now campaign, which aims to mobilise 100,000 people to call for the UK Government to put poor people first in climate negotiations.
Oxfam is an active member of the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, which has been seeking to influence approval of an E.ON proposal to build a coal-fired power station in Kingsnorth, Kent. More than 4,000 Oxfam campaigners emailed the company's CEO, Paul Golby, to protest against the plans.

Health and education are basic rights to which every person is entitled. But in the twenty-first century, these rights remain a distant dream for millions of people. Today, 80 million children are out of school, while 1,400 women die in pregnancy or childbirth every day with no access to professional care. Oxfam supports health and education work at a grassroots level, from building and equipping classrooms and training teachers to running major health care and awareness programmes with communities affected by HIV and AIDS. We also campaign locally, nationally and globally for basic education and health care for all.

Basic Social Services: Oxfam's approach
Good quality basic social services are crucial to tackling poverty and inequality. Securing Oxfam's other aims ­ sustainable livelihoods, peace and security, social and political participation and gender equality ­ depend on each individual being able to access decent health care, clean water and education.
During 2008/09, Oxfam continued to support health and education development work in communities worldwide; to mobilise thousands of ordinary people to campaign for health and education for all; and to lobby at a national and global level for state investment ­ supplemented by international aid ­ in basic social services.
Equipped for life, Tanzania
In the Shinyanga district of Tanzania, a pilot education programme has delivered impressive results ­ and has the potential to improve the quality of education across the country. Oxfam developed the EQUIP1 programme in 2003, in response to the district's poor achievement in primary schools and the low rate of progress to secondary schools. At the time, teachers had little training and classroom methods were outdated and ineffective.
EQUIP, which has been jointly implemented by Oxfam and the Shinyanga District Authorities, set out to improve classroom practices, to promote child-centred teaching methods, and to empower teachers and other education workers through training, mentoring and professional development. By devising a programme which is in line with the Tanzanian Government's education strategy, and fully involving the local government with the implementation of the project, Oxfam aims to ensure that the project is both sustainable and easily replicated.
In 2008, five years after the programme began, 1,587 teachers had benefited from on-the-job training. A further 172 head teachers, 332 school-based mentors and 688 school committee members have also participated in professional training and development. Even within the context of national progress due to the government's education programme, the rise in standards in Shinyanga since 2003 is exceptional. In 2003, the district's exam results were 30 per cent below the national average; by 2008, they were well above it. During the same period, the number of children progressing to secondary school has doubled.2
The challenge now is to try to replicate this success in other parts of Tanzania. The children of the Maasai communities in Ngorongoro district face even greater obstacles to education than their neighbours in Shinyanga. Children tend to work from a young age, and schools are often at a distance which prohibits regular attendance. Oxfam is applying lessons from the EQUIP programme: running teacher-training courses and raising community awareness of the value of education. We're

funding pre-schools, which bring basic education within walking distance of children in remote areas. And at the primary schools, Oxfam-funded boarding facilities are making education an option for Maasai children (see opposite).
Keeping the MDGs on track
In September 2008, governments from around the world gathered at a UN high-level event in New York to discuss the progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Basic social services for the world's poorest people are at the heart of the MDGs, which were set in 2000 with a deadline of 2015. This mid-point meeting presented a vital opportunity to get the faltering goals back on track.
Maternal mortality was the MDG which had fallen furthest behind target, but after the New York meeting it was top of the agenda. This was thanks in part to the efforts of Oxfam's high-level lobbying, backed up by popular campaigning. In the UK, more than 10,000 Oxfam supporters knitted a square towards the world's biggest baby blanket ­ a visual petition drawing attention to the 1,400 mothers who die needlessly in pregnancy and childbirth every day. If the measures promised in New York are fulfilled, they will help save the lives of ten million mothers and newborn babies over the next seven years.
During the MDG event, Oxfam launched In My Name, an interactive campaign to recruit global support for the MDGs. A short music video, with contributions from celebrities, public figures and members of the public calling on the UN to meet their targets, was viewed by over 250,000 people in the first 24 hours alone.
An estimated $16bn dollars was pledged at the UN meeting, including an extra $4.5bn for education and an extra $2bn for health care. While the figures will help boost the efforts of poor countries to reach their targets, they are put in perspective by the $700bn bailout package for the US economy, agreed just days after the UN meeting ended.
Breakthrough on affordable medicines
In February 2009, Oxfam welcomed the latest step towards better access to medicines for poor people. The multinational drugs company GlaxoSmithKline pledged to cut the price of drugs to the world's 52 poorest countries, and to invest 20 per cent of the profits from sales to the least-developed countries back into their national health infrastructure.
Oxfam has been campaigning on access to medicines since 2001. Working with others, we have helped to bring about a drastic fall in prices and an increase in the use of generic medicines, so that now more than three million people have access to free anti-retroviral therapy.

Education for all, Tanzania

He says: ""I was always tired and never finished my work. I began boarding and then I had catching up to do. Now I am fine and I work hard to be near the top in class."" His father Masuni Layan, a cattle herder, adds: ""I see the goodness of schooling. The world depends on education now... it is a must.""

When disaster strikes, Oxfam is there. In 2008/09, we helped nearly five million people to cope in emergencies ­ ordinary women, men and children who were caught up in conflict or natural disasters. Oxfam is one of the world's leading agencies in the provision of water, sanitation and hygiene promotion. We aim to ensure that people have the assistance and protection during emergencies which we believe is their right. We lobby governments and the international community to live up to their responsibilities to protect civilians, and to improve the quantity, quality and accountability of humanitarian aid delivery worldwide.

16 Trustees' Report Right to life and security

""We're extremely proud to be a partner of the Oxfam 365 Alliance, ensuring that Oxfam is ready to respond to emergencies worldwide within hours. This partnership is one of the ways that demonstrates our global commitment to social responsibility, and enables us to update our employees and other stakeholders regularly on how our support is making a difference."" Louella Eastman, Group CR Director, Aviva plc.1

Objective To increase the capacity of local staff and partners to respond to emergencies; to ensure the smooth transition from emergency response to long-term development; and to help communities to reduce their risks.
In 2008/09, almost 4,780,000 people benefited from Oxfam's humanitarian work ­ we responded to over 50 emergencies in 33 countries. Most of these programmes have been delivered by national staff and partners working with local civil society organisations (275 in all).
Despite this success, 2008/09 has proved to be a challenging year for humanitarian response. The actions of an increasing number of governments to restrict or expel those who seek to offer assistance, while at the same time failing to deliver it themselves, is presenting major obstacles for Oxfam and other humanitarian agencies. During the year our aid programmes were temporarily suspended in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. In March 2009, the Government of Sudan revoked the licenses of Oxfam and 15 other aid agencies to operate in northern Sudan. All our assets were handed over to the government, our 450 staff were made redundant and our programmes and offices were closed down. Oxfam remains deeply concerned about the long-term impact of this on the poorest, most vulnerable people in northern Sudan, where we were providing water and vital services to 600,000 people. We are exploring ways of helping to ensure that vulnerable people in Sudan receive the support they need. We must take up the challenge this trend represents, and work creatively to ensure that humanitarian assistance is delivered to those who need it most.
We are increasingly working `semi-operationally' in humanitarian crises, complementing local initiatives with funding, technical and managerial support, and providing materials and equipment which are distributed and managed by those closest to the communities affected. This approach is one of the most effective means of getting the right help, quickly, to the people who need it most, as well as enabling local organisations and communities to respond to future disasters.
We have also enhanced the capacity of local staff and partners to respond to crises through more formal means. In 2008/09, Oxfam committed to a clear vision for how we wish to improve the quantity and quality of our humanitarian assistance by investing in skills and capacity in the most vulnerable countries. All seven Oxfam regions have made progress towards this vision,

by developing humanitarian skills and awareness in existing staff and partners and appointing new staff members. Southern Africa and East Asia have created regional Emergency Response Teams, consisting of skilled staff who are available to travel quickly to respond to crises. This complements our global team of specialist staff who can be deployed to emergencies at short notice.
The number of reported disasters is increasing, particularly those associated with floods and storms. The evidence suggests that this trend is a result of people's increasing vulnerability and of an increase in extreme weather events caused by climate change. (Oxfam understands `vulnerability' to be exposure to risk and the lack of ability to cope with its consequences.2) As climate change gathers pace, the frequency and/or severity of many extreme weather events are expected to increase significantly. As well as enhancing our own capacity, we are building the capacity of communities to reduce the risk and impact of such events, which improves the quality and quantity of our response. Work is underway on this across the world; it includes raising homesteads in Bangladesh, supporting drought cycle management in Kenya, and securing funding to help cotton farmers in Mali to adapt to climate change. We are also promoting Participatory Community Vulnerability Analysis (PCVA) in several countries, including Vietnam, Mozambique, Bangladesh and Guatemala. This enables communities to develop their own contingency plans to cope with disasters when they happen.
In most cases our impact on humanitarian crises is not only through the delivery of practical assistance, but also through our advocacy and campaigning work. In 2008/09 we published twin reports, For a Safer Tomorrow and The Right to Survive,3 which set out our views on humanitarian protection and assistance and form the core of Oxfam's Rights in Crisis campaign. They are intended to be source books for the humanitarian sector as well as statements of Oxfam's current position on humanitarianism. Together with national and international allies, we have advocated strongly for more effective protection of civilians and improved humanitarian assistance in a number of crisis-affected countries such as Sudan, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Oxfam scaled up rapidly to provide assistance to more than 500,000 people. Throughout the conflict we have sought to bring the crisis to the world's attention, to push for more peacekeeping troops to protect ordinary families, and to lobby the international community for long-term support to end the conflict. Based on extensive discussions with communities about their safety, we called for the UN force to translate their protection mandate into real action. We helped them to develop a booklet on practical engagement on protection to be given to all newly deployed peacekeepers. Photo: Darren Fletcher/The Sun 2.

Oxfam's Accountability Framework sets out our definition of accountability and our responsibilities to all our stakeholders. The framework has been reviewed to focus on ensuring that staff attitudes and beliefs support our commitment to increased accountability to beneficiaries. The framework also encourages all programmes to have some form of feedback or complaints mechanism and to improve our service to beneficiaries. So far, more than ten countries have adopted the framework and there is anecdotal evidence that small-scale initiatives are being undertaken elsewhere.
Oxfam took part in the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Relief (SCHR) peer review on account ability.4 One of the conclusions of our peers is that: ""Oxfam seems to resonate with ambition ­ to make a difference to the lives of poor people; to make the humanitarian system more humanitarian; to do the right thing to be really accountable to beneficiaries."" It recognised that this can empower but also put pressure on staff. It also recommended that Oxfam should establish a system for periodic feedback about complaints coming in to field staff and offices; this information should be analysed for any important trends and to ensure that appropriate action is taken. We have put in place a system to implement this recommendation; ongoing monitoring will take place to assess effectiveness, and adjustments will be made accordingly.
Cholera prevention, Zimbabwe
During the year, Oxfam supported more than one million people affected by Zimbabwe's food and cholera crises, in a country ravaged by the effects of political instability and hyperinflation. We continued our seasonal food distribution programme to support the most vulnerable families during the `hunger period' between harvests. Working in collaboration with the World Food Programme, we delivered regular supplies of maize meal, vegetable oil and pulses to 250,000 people.

The cholera epidemic, which started in August 2008, claimed the lives of over 4,000 people. Hundreds of Oxfam-trained community volunteers ran an intensive health promotion campaign to prevent the spread of the disease: distributing hygiene kits and communicating vital messages through street theatre, discussion groups and house-to-house visits. Working with partners, we helped to install clean water and safe sanitation facilities in schools, clinics and cholera treatment centres in some of the worst-affected areas. We also worked with the local authorities to install 20 new boreholes in Harare, the capital ­ giving hundreds of thousands of people a safe, clean water supply.
Disaster to development: Tsunami response
In December 2008, Oxfam International (OI) ­ the global confederation of 13 Oxfams, of which Oxfam GB is a member ­ closed its response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami, exactly four years after the disaster. OI received $294m in donations, more than 90 per cent of it from the public. Over the four years, working with local partner organisations, OI assisted 2.5 million people in seven Tsunami-affected countries.5
Activities included the provision of clean water and sanitation facilities to people displaced by the disaster; rebuilding the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of poor people, especially women; and the construction of permanent houses to better protect communities against future disasters.
Oxfam GB Chief Executive Barbara Stocking said: ""The tangible results, such as the new houses and fishing boats, are only one marker of progress. The less visible interventions are just as important. We have helped to give people better access to markets for their goods. We have helped them gain the knowledge they need to protect themselves against future disasters, and the confidence to demand a say in decisions that affect them.""

of the Tsunami response, are available at www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/tsunami


Getting heard Ensuring that poor and marginalised communities have a say in decisions that affect them is an aim which runs through every area of Oxfam's work.
In emergencies, this can mean ensuring that different groups are consulted when taking decisions about, for example, the location of latrines and tapstands. In our development work, it's often about helping people to understand and lobby for their rights ­ and to hold their government and other decision-makers to account. In global campaigns, it means ensuring that the voices of poor people are heard, and acted on, in the corridors of power. A good example of this is the `climate hearings' which will ultimately bring the testimonies of thousands of ordinary people, worldwide, to the crucial climate negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009 (see page 8).
Raising Her Voice
In 2008, Oxfam began work on a five-year programme, Raising Her Voice. This aims to promote the right and capacity of poor women to engage effectively in governance by ensuring that public policy, decision-making and expenditure ­ as well as national, customary and traditional rights ­ reflect the interests of poor and marginalised women.
Raising Her Voice, which is mainly funded by the Department for International Development (DFID), will invest over £5 million between 2008 and 2013. Projects in 17 countries in Africa, South and East Asia, Central and South America, Eastern Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will focus on four activities:
· Networking, campaigning and advocacy with poor women activists.
· Working with public institutions and decision-making forums, including ensuring that the African Union Protocol on the Rights of Women is signed, ratified and implemented.
· Empowering civil society organisations to achieve women's rights.
· Disseminating best practice through innovative media and communications.
A `global inception workshop' was held in Oxford in September 2008, bringing together staff and partners from the 17 project countries to network, share ideas, and learn from the rich variety of strategies that will be used in the diverse contexts of participating countries.
Taking a stand, Sierra Leone
In Sierra Leone, women are marginalised at all levels of decision-making. Oxfam supports the Promoting a Culture of Equal Representation (PACER) project, which aims to increase the involvement of women in the political process. The project is based on the premise that a greater number of women in parliament and local gove rnm ent will directly contribute to a positive change in the lives of poor people in Sierra Leone. Aspiring women candidates receive training and education to build

confidence and solidarity; those who decide to stand are supported throughout the nomination process, the election campaign and beyond. PACER also runs `voter education programmes' in the constituencies, contributing to a sense of solidarity among women.
The project has seen notable success in Koinadugu, which has a reputation for being the most conservative district in the country. In 2007, Koinadugu fielded its first-ever female parliamentary candidate. At the end of 2008, it had six women on the district council.
The benefits of PACER's work go far beyond the election results. Many influential men, including religious and traditional leaders, are now backing the project. Far more women are aware of, and using, their right to vote. Now, women don't just attend public meetings; they sit at the front and make meaningful contributions. They recognise their right to participate ­ and to lead ­ in public life.
Turning up the volume on UK poverty
In April 2009, Oxfam warned that the UK is fast becoming a nation of FREDs: Forgotten by those in power; Ripped-off by taxes and the benefits system; Excluded from opportunities; Debt-ridden because they can't afford to get by. Oxfam is enabling people in poverty in the UK to speak out.
As the UK recession threatened to push millions of people into ­ or deeper into ­ poverty, Oxfam's FRED concept grabbed the public imagination and ensured widespread media coverage around the launch of our report, Close to Home: UK Poverty and the Economic Downturn. This proposes a six-point rescue plan, and calls on the UK Government to put it into action. Recommended measures include raising the incomes of the poorest people, alongside protecting the incomes of those who are vulnerable to poverty, reforming the tax and benefits system for the long term, and transforming attitudes towards poverty.
The report gives a voice to people living in poverty in the UK. One of them, Kathleen Turner, also agreed to be interviewed on Newsnight and the BBC news. ""I used to be quite well-off, running a pet food business, and quite well-known,"" says Kathleen. ""But now, as a carer for my disabled husband and son, I'm forced into accepting doorstep loans, from companies charging exorbitant interest rates taking advantage of people like me."" Airing her problems on national television wasn't easy for Kathleen, or her family. But she believes that speaking out is important. ""Talking about the reality of doorstep loans, the benefits system, the daily struggle of being poor, I might help open a few people's eyes, get them thinking. If it can affect me, it can affect anyone.""
FRED and Close to Home sparked national debate and gained mass media attention with features on major radio and television news programmes including BBC Today, BBC Radio 4 and Sky News; in several national newspapers including The DailyTelegraph and The Guardian; and on a wide range of websites and blogs.

It also called for bold action to mitigate the shortterm impacts, and to prevent the `slow-burn' effects of recession on people's life chances, aspirations and opportunities.

(Gender and diversity)
Of the 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty, more than two-thirds are women or girls. Gender discrimination is a major cause of their continuing poverty. Oxfam strives for equal rights for women and men, by promoting women's rights, supporting their participation in development and education, and challenging entrenched attitudes which perpetuate poverty and inequality. This aim is now integral to every area of our work.


""I feel proud as one of the founders of the We Can campaign in South Asia region, and personally committed to supporting the campaign as a social movement in Bangladesh."" Shamim Ara Begum, Director of Polli Sree, We Can alliance member, Bangladesh

Objective We will continue to ensure that women's rights are at the heart of all we do, by:
1. Strengthening `gender mainstreaming' in Oxfam and with partners
Oxfam aims to put women's empowerment and gender equality at the heart of our development, campaigns and humanitarian work. This year we continued to focus on integrating women's rights into all of our work (gender mainstreaming), both internally and with our partner organisations.
In 2008/09, work on women's adaptation to climate change continued, with the development of gender and women's rights policy positions, the strengthening of alliances and networks, and participation in a number of high-level events. Sisters on the Planet, a multi-media pack highlighting the specific impact of climate change on women, has been used around the world ­ including as a key training tool for more than 40 delegates at the UN Climate Change Conference in Poznan (December 2008). Campaigning and advocacy will continue this year, including at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, in collaboration with the Global Gender and Climate Change Alliance.
Gender equality is increasingly a core element of Oxfam's livelihoods and governance work. In Sri Lanka, for example, Oxfam's work to build financial services which are accessible to poor people gave greater

priority to supporting women entrepreneurs. In the past, poor women have often been prevented from using financial services because banks request assets or land as collateral. In response to lobbying by Oxfam, commercial banks agreed to waive this request, enabling women to invest in business initiatives.
While there has clearly been progress on gender across the organisation, we are still falling short of our overall target. This is being addressed in a range of ways across our global programme, including new approaches to staff training, increased focus on gender from senior leadership, and more targeted integration of women's rights in our policy and campaigns work.
2. Scaling up our successful work to reduce violence against women
The We Can campaign (a campaign to end violence against women) went from strength to strength in 2008/09. More than 2,400 We Can alliance partners and 2.7 million `Change Makers' ­ women and men who are spreading the campaign message in their local communities ­ are now mobilised in six countries across South Asia.
Oxfam is a founding member of the campaign, which was launched in Bangladesh in 2004. By creating an alliance of organisations, communities and individuals, We Can aims to transform the social attitudes, beliefs and practices that perpetuate violence against women (see opposite). We Can, in affiliation with Oxfam

Campaign success, Yemen
Midwife Awatef Salih talks to a mother and her baby girl at the Maddodha mobile health clinic, Yemen. In February 2009, the Yemeni Government introduced a bill to increase the minimum age of marriage for girls from 13 to 17 years. This represented a major breakthrough for Oxfam and our partners in Yemen who have been campaigning against early marriage since 2005. The campaign worked at national and local levels to promote understanding of the harm done by early marriage, for example as a barrier to girls' education, a contributing factor to high maternal and infant mortality rates, and as a practice that perpetuates the cycle of poverty.

We Can goes from strength to strength
Men and women take to the streets of Gaibandha District, northern Bangladesh, in support of We Can.
In South Asia today, 50 million women are considered `missing' as a result of violence against them. The We Can campaign, which began in Bangladesh in 2004, aims to reduce social acceptance of violence against women by challenging and changing the attitudes and behaviours of ordinary people. It does so by recruiting `Change Makers' ­ individuals who first commit to personal change and then to take the campaign message to at least ten others.
In South Asia, We Can aims to reach five million Change Makers by 2011, influencing a target of 50 million people. Last year, the first detailed impact assessment of We Can was carried out in India. The results show a significant shift in attitudes to violence against women and on women's rights in general.

International, is now active in several other countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Canada and the Netherlands. The campaign is also in its initial, preparatory phase in Indonesia, Uganda, Niger, the UK, and in Latin America.
In a separate initiative in the Middle East, Oxfam's partner KAFA, in Lebanon, has been working with men and boys to end gender violence. KAFA is now implementing similar programmes in Syria, Jordan, Eygpt and Yemen.
Oxfam's humanitarian response continues to ensure that women's specific needs are met, with an additional focus this year on ending violence against women in conflict situations. This was supported by a new policy and the publication of guidelines, Programming to Reduce Risk of Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict.
3. Expanding our work on women's political and economic leadership
Work on women's political leadership in Malawi, Sierra Leone, Haiti, Cambodia and Honduras has delivered tangible results. In Sierra Leone, the work of Oxfam's partner PACER led to a record number of female candidates in local council elections (see page 22).

In Malawi, a `50:50' campaign supported women's participation in the 2009 elections, with the registration of 170 aspiring candidates. Raising Her Voice, a programme to enable women to engage in governance, was launched in 17 countries (see page 22). A global initiative, The Poor Women's Economic Leadership Programme, is helping women in the Philippines, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, India, Mali, Sierra Leone, the UK and Haiti to improve their economic prospects.
Significant change for women has been achieved through the highly successful work on the African Women's Protocol (AWP), a pan-African legal instrument setting out women's human rights across Africa. Oxfam has supported a number of women's rights organisations to advocate the ratification and implementation of the AWP, with considerable success. For example, in Zambia, engagement with traditional leaders has led to a ban on child marriages and `sexual cleansing'. Because of increased awareness among policy makers, civil society and the media, countries including Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi have included AWP provisions in their legal and policy framework.

Securing resources & developing Oxfam
Objective To manage change processes effectively and start `delivery with drive', by:
1. Completing `National Change Strategy' processes in all regions
In 2008/09, 53 out of 56 country teams completed `National Change Strategies' (NCS). These form a key part of Oxfam's overall focus on working simply and effectively to deliver results. Teams were challenged to consider `how change happens' in their context and what role Oxfam can play in achieving change. External stakeholders including donors, academics, other NGOs, partners and poor people themselves were consulted. These consultations enriched thinking and have often formed the basis for new partnerships that can strengthen our programme in the future.
It is clear that much of our existing programme work remains relevant. However, the NCS process highlighted some new preoccupations across the organisation, including:
· Inequality, and how our programmes could do more to address it.
· Stronger recognition of the role of discrimination (ethnic, racial or gender) in reinforcing inequality and perpetuating the exclusion of certain social groups.
· The importance and role of the state in achieving change.
2. Linking National Change Strategies to global campaigning
This increasing emphasis on the role of the state has led to a focus on connecting our experience on the ground with changes in national level policies and practice. Although we are known for our campaigning and policy work globally, this new focus is on how we can bring this experience and expertise to our work at a national level, and how we can link our national and global work more effectively to deliver change. This approach is already achieving results (see box).
In some cases, this shift demands that staff develop new skills and ways of working. In October 2008, a group of 24 Country Directors and campaign and policy staff met in Hanoi, Vietnam, to share experiences of national level advocacy work. This resulted in a number of initiatives to further strengthen capacity and skills. Follow-up meetings have been held in East/South Asia and in West Africa. These have focused on the challenges and learning from doing advocacy in these regional contexts and have encouraged the creation of peer-to-peer support networks.

3. Providing effective change management support
Implementation of NCS has often involved significant change management processes, the majority of which are well advanced or have been completed this year. Other aspects of implementation are ongoing.
Challenges
One clear challenge to implementation that emerged during the year was the global economic crisis, which led to significant reductions in country budgets. In some cases, this has hampered the ability of country teams to advance with aspects of work envisaged in the NCS. In other cases, it has pushed teams to move faster to implement decisions outlined in the strategies and has assisted them in being more focused in their programming choices. Many managers agree that the NCS have been extremely valuable in helping them to manage through the downturn and giving them a clear basis on which to make tough decisions.
Objective To develop our people to deliver organisational priorities, while recognising and responding to individual needs, by:
1. Strengthening management skills
Performance management is now embedded across Oxfam: 100 per cent of GB-based staff and 94 per cent of international staff had performance reviews. The `Being an Oxfam Manager' training course was run in ten locations around the world for 155 participants. More than 30 people participated in the `Management and Leadership Programme' for high-potential senior managers. There was a strong focus on coaching as a means of development, including a programme to develop 15 internal coaches. A Project Cycle Management manual and associated training was widely disseminated among international programme staff.
Examples of greater focus on policy and advocacy work
Colombia: Oxfam played a key facilitative role in enabling coalitions of partners and producer organisations to influence the municipal administration's Food Supply Plan for Bogotá. This allows for a much greater role for small producers and is now being taken up as an example by other municipal administrations.
Malawi: Oxfam provided skills and support to partners in the development of an innovative and high profile national level campaign in the lead-up to the 2009 elections. This was called `50/50' and aimed to get more women candidates into parliament.
Russia: Advocacy work, with partners, on access to health services led to the government scrapping its requirement that people with disabilities register each year. This requirement was a key reason for many disabled people remaining unregistered and therefore not having access to key services. The policy change has potentially benefited more than six million people.

2. `Growing our Own' and increasing diversity
In 2008/09 we continued to see good progress in the `Growing our Own' initiative, which encourages the development and promotion of current staff. 63 per cent of senior management vacancies (levels A and B) and 47 per cent of middle and junior management roles (levels C and D) were filled by internal candidates. The Corporate Management Team led its annual succession planning process to ensure the organisation has planned and discussed potential successors to key roles. The team identified a `developing' or `ready now' successor for 83 per cent of the 77 key roles discussed.
Most international regions now have positive action plans to increase the diversity of their workforces ­ focusing on relevant minority groups in their countries ­ which they have begun to implement. In the UK, diversity targets for representation of women in the workforce were exceeded, including at senior levels, but black and minority ethnic representation remained static, with our Trading and Marketing Divisions well below target.
3. Implementing the GOLD project
In 2008/09 our GOLD project, to implement the PeopleSoft HR system across the world, was implemented as planned. GOLD provides us with complete and easily accessible data about our staff globally. Human Resources teams in the UK and overseas are enthusiastic about the ability it gives us to provide better support for people management across Oxfam. The focus is now on realising the full benefits of having implemented the core HR modules. In future years, we will extend GOLD to support Workforce Monitoring (skills and competencies relating to posts and people) and Talent Management (eg. succession planning and career development).
""It's really useful to have the GOLD system. It means all our employee data is held in one place, and we can run lots of reports to produce management information. As time passes, employee history will build up on jobs, pay, training, absence and performance. This will enable better people management from now on."" Anna Dinnis, MEEECIS Regional HR
Objective To achieve culture change through greater openness and honesty, keeping things simple, and a stronger focus on delivery and accountability.
Oxfam responded to the impact of the economic recession with our Fit for the Future programme to prioritise our work and improve our efficiency. This resulted in significant savings on staff and other costs; 80 posts were cut in the UK and further posts around the world, the majority of them in Regional Centres. Fit for the Future involved a review of the skills Oxfam needs to maximise new opportunities (eg. digital and interactive media). We also reviewed our planning processes and programme information requirements, and work began to simplify these.

Efforts to improve our openness continued, and there was widespread use of `360 degree feedback' (which involves gathering feedback from a range of colleagues) in performance reviews. We also continued to encourage and facilitate external shadowing and mentoring opportunities for senior managers.
A culture change programme, originally planned to be led by an external organisational development specialist, did not proceed, given the need to prioritise Fit for the Future. This initiative will be developed further in 2009/10.
Objective To develop the new supporter strategy to deepen engagement and encourage further action, by:
1. Creating a stronger connection with the UK public
In April 2008 we successfully launched our Be Humankind brand refresh, with prime-time television advertisements broadcast nationwide and billboards in cities across the UK. Throughout 2008/09 this bold, modern, dynamic, and more direct way of communicating Oxfam's message was integrated through all our marketing activities. It was very well received both by supporters and by the wider public, and moved Oxfam to first position in ratings for `top of mind charity in the UK'.1 This position is of huge benefit to us in maintaining our relationship with existing supporters and attracting new ones.
We have not yet achieved our overall goal of increasing the public's knowledge of and emotional engagement with Oxfam. The difficult economic situation has had a negative impact on the public's engagement with charities across the board; it has also forced us to scale down investment in our brand refresh. Our ambition for the coming year is to maintain the brand by inspiring people to take action in support of our climate change campaign.
""Since most charity ads set out to shock, it's easy for us to turn off. The Oxfam ad has the virtue of being different, of shocking but also surprising."" Claire Beale, The Independent, April 2008
2. Improving supporters' experience
Communicating our work and its impact, effectively and efficiently, to our one million supporters is critical to staying relevant and keeping our supporters engaged.
In 2008/09, we successfully implemented our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, which gives a single view of our supporters ­ who they are, what they have done, how they prefer us to communicate with them and, if relevant, the areas of Oxfam's work they are interested in. Knowing this helps us to understand them better, provide them with the level of contact that is right for them, and inspire them to take action against poverty.
1 Oxfam's brand tracking study, run by Hall & Partners, May and October 2008, asked 600 members of the public who support charities to name the first charity they could think of.

32 Trustees' Report Supporting the programme

During the year we also worked on integrating our campaign and fundraising messages throughout all our communications (including in our high street shops). This will both improve people's understanding of how we work to overcome poverty, and increase support for our UK fundraising and campaigning activities.
Accountability
We received a total of 1,522 complaints from supporters (down from 1,921 in 2007/08). Of these, 64 complaints (down from 72 last year) met the Fundraising Standards Board (FSB) definition and so were reported as part of our statutory reporting to them. All of these were resolved without further action or escalation. No complaints were referred directly to the FSB.
Objective To begin to move investment from current fundraising and supporter engagement models to future models, by:
1. Scoping out the investment needed
We have identified new approaches to fundraising through the development of our corporate plans. We continue to invest in new capability and new ways of fundraising, but our overall levels of investment have been reduced in line with changes in the external economic environment.
2. Developing our `Digital Vision'
The Digital Vision programme was conceived in 2007, in response to evidence that Oxfam wasn't fully embracing the opportunities presented by digital technology. In 2008/09, we approved the strategy that will enable us to become more effective at using and implementing interactive digital media ­ including mobile, internet and social networking channels ­ to communicate Oxfam's message and inspire more people to take action. A major, cross-divisional project is now underway to deliver the infrastructure and skills needed to support this.
3. Maximising our potential in e-commerce
Oxfam's online shop delivered £900,000 sales of donated and Fair Trade goods this year. More than 110,000 individual items were listed on the site, and two new warehouses were opened to manage production and fulfilment of sales. Launching the first online charity shop in the UK has been challenging. We had to pilot new software and sophisticated search programmes in order to manage the wide variety of individual items that we offer (in comparison to a conventional retailer's online shop). These systems are now working well, but required intensive efforts to set up. As a result, we fell six months behind schedule, and consequently fell short of our overall income targets. As a result, capital investment will now be phased back as we focus our efforts on breaking even in 2009.

4. Capturing fundraising opportunities
The Enterprise Development Programme, which links UK business leaders with small or medium-sized business enterprises in developing countries, continues to expand (see below).
In 2008/09 we continued to develop community fundraising, with a focus on music and team events. A new Head of Community Fundraising was appointed and a new team structure put in place, with staff to support fundraising in the north-west and Midlands regions. We continued to develop our core fundraising events such as the Oxjam music festival and community walks, giving members of the public more interesting and exciting ways to raise money and volunteer for Oxfam.
In 2008/09 we also launched Trailtrekker, an annual team endurance event set in the Yorkshire Dales. By year end, more than 177 teams of four people had signed up to take part in the first Trailtrekker in May 2009, and pledged to raise over £250,000, exceeding our target. A model for future growth is now in place; the ambition is to make Trailtrekker Oxfam's biggest fundraising event, raising over £700,000 by 2010/11.
Objective To achieve a total income of £301.6 million
Our total income was £308.3m against a £301.6m budget. Costs to raise income, at £82.8m, were lower than the budget of £91.2m, leaving net income available at £225.5m.
Total income from fundraising was £200.5m compared to budget of £212.8m, with fundraising costs reduced to £19.8m against a budget of £26.5m. This gave a net fundraised income of £180.7m against a budget of £186.3m.
Income from shops was £79.3m against a budget of £80.7m, with costs of £62.9m against a budget of £64.6m, giving a net income of £16.4m, against a budget of £16.1m.
(See Finance Summary, page 39.)
Objective Business leaders, private philanthropists and global foundations will recognise Oxfam as a key organisation in ending poverty, by:
1. Increasing our engagement with businesses
This year saw the continued growth of the Enterprise Development Programme, modelling economic, social and market change through a growing portfolio of small to medium-sized business enterprises in developing countries. Six business leaders and private philanthropists are now investing in the programme. Seven proposals to the value of £1.2m were approved in May 2008. First year spending on these was £488,000.


Five new proposals will be going before the Enterprise Development Board in June 2009. A separate Development Board, which will help to build Oxfam's networks and fundraising with a strategic focus on climate change, was agreed and will be launched in 2009.
We appointed an agency to review Oxfam's communications to the business sector, resulting in a plan for more effective communications, to be targeted at specific segments of the business market. This included creating a new area specifically for business managers on the Oxfam website. As a result of the review, we also developed shorter, more topical briefing papers called `Briefings for Business'. Two of these, Business and the Millennium Development Goals and A Business Case for Fighting Poverty, were published and distributed to around 500 businesses.
In November 2008 we launched the `Better Returns in a Better World' initiative with the publication of a specialist Briefing for Business paper: Responsible Investment as a Force for Poverty Alleviation. The initiative consists of a programme of events, backed up with materials, to help business leaders understand the vital role they can play in overcoming poverty.
We also began a feasibility project with a multinational fast-moving consumer goods company. The project is exploring how poor producers can be integrated into the company's supply chains in a mutually beneficial way ­ providing the company with a cost-effective service, and producers and their communities with a way out of poverty.
2. Engaging with global foundations
Oxfam GB has increased the visibility of our agriculture, humanitarian and private sector work by engaging with US donors through Oxfam America and through contact with them in our day-to-day programme work. Major US foundations including the Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, and Rockefeller Foundation engaged with Oxfam, recognising our leadership and reputation in the areas outlined above.
As part of our continuing aim to diversify and expand Oxfam's funding base, we continued to engage with foundations and organisations in the Gulf, with the following outcomes:
Oxfam's distinctive competency in water, sanitation and hygiene is widely acknowledged by Dubai Cares, Khalifa Foundation, Zayed Foundation, Qatar Charity and other organisations. Dubai Cares wishes Oxfam to lead on technical support and innovation in this area of their programmes.
Khalifa Foundation is interested in a longer-term, global partnership with Oxfam in water, sanitation and hygiene, and food security. The Zayed Foundation and Qatar Charity are also interested in working with us on water, sanitation and hygiene, livelihoods and other areas.

Structure, governance & management
Oxfam is a registered charity in England and Scotland and is constituted as a company registered in England and limited by guarantee. Its objects and powers are set out in its Memorandum and Articles of Association. Following a review by Trustees and members of Oxfam's Association, the Trustees approved a change to the charity's objects on 24 April 2009. The change modernises the charity's objects through the inclusion of a specific reference to protecting vulnerable people, as well as including objects for the promotion of sustainable development, gender equity, diversity and human rights. The new objects still retain a primary focus on the prevention and relief of poverty, with each of the new objects containing a specific reference to poverty. The change allows the Trustees to receive funds and approve programmes which seek to tackle a wide range of root causes of poverty, with the certain knowledge that such programmes fall within the charity's objects. The Trustees are grateful to the Charity Commission and Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator for their support and guidance during the review.
Oxfam has several subsidiaries, only two of which were consolidated into Oxfam's group accounts; these subsidiaries were Oxfam Activities Limited (Oxfam GB's trading subsidiary) and Finance for Development Limited (a micro-credit institution in Azerbaijan). Oxfam has two dormant subsidiaries and also has a joint venture interest in Frip Ethique (a private-sector enterprise in Senegal), which has not been consolidated on the grounds of immateriality in the context of these financial statements (see below and Note 9a for further details).
Oxfam Activities Limited raises funds by means of trading activities. Its principal operations are the purchase of goods from commercial suppliers to be sold at a profit, mainly through Oxfam shops, and the recycling of donated goods at a textile recycling plant in Huddersfield (known as Oxfam Wastesaver). Oxfam Activities Limited made a profit of £1.8m (2007/08: £2.3m) before interest, on working capital of £0.2m (2007/08: £0.2m) paid to Oxfam. This represents a 22 per cent decrease in profit, mainly due to an increase in the support costs from Oxfam, increased distribution costs and a reduction in donations and events income.
Finance for Development Limited is a limited liability company in the Azerbaijan Republic and provides financial services (mainly credit) on a sustainable basis to segments of the population with relatively low income who do not have access to other financial sources. Its net income for the year was £0.8m (2007/08: £0.4m).
Oxfam still maintains a `special share' in Coffee Producers Company Limited (a company registered in the United Kingdom, number 5144719) which owns 25 per cent of


Progreso Cafes Limited and has control over the Coffee Producers Trust, which also owns 25 per cent. Since Oxfam does not have either a dominant or significant influence in Progreso, it has not been consolidated.
Oxfam Activities Limited owns 50 per cent of the shares in Frip Ethique, a company registered in Senegal which imports second-hand clothing (mainly from Wastesaver) and then sorts and distributes the clothing for resale in the local markets. The net assets of the company, after considering impairment, are immaterial, and the joint venture has therefore not been consolidated. Since the year-end, Oxfam Activities Limited's shareholding has increased to 100 per cent.
Oxfam Activities Limited has a ten per cent (2007/08: ten per cent) interest in Cafédirect plc (a company registered in Scotland with registration number 141496), which promotes Fair Trade, primarily through the marketing and distribution of tea and coffee. Cafédirect shares are traded on a `matched bargain facility' called Ethex, operated by Brewin Dolphin.
Oxfam (also known as Oxfam GB) is a member of Oxfam International, a separate legal entity registered in the Netherlands as a charitable foundation (registration number 41159611). Oxfam International encourages and co-ordinates joint activities with 12 other affiliated international agencies, each separately constituted under the appropriate national regulations. Oxfam GB received grants from, and made grants to, members of this group. During the year, Oxfam received income of £22.8m (2007/08: £14.6m) from the other members of Oxfam International and made grants of £4.4m (2007/08: £5.2m) to them.
Oxfam remained a key member of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund (OITF), which was estab lished in 2004/05 to co-ordinate and manage the funds from Oxfam International members in respect of the Asian Tsunami of December 2004. Oxfam received £4.2m from the fund during 2008/09 (£1.0m in 2007/08). As in previous years, Oxfam did not contribute any funds to the OITF, being one of the main operational affiliates in respect of Tsunami response activities. Since the year-end, the Fund has been closed following the completion of its work.
Oxfam is a member of the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation representing 13 leading UK agencies. It aims to maximise income from the public in respect of a humanitarian disaster, and to co-ordinate an effective humanitarian response.
Trustees
The directors of Oxfam GB are the Trustees, collectively known as Oxfam's Council. This Council, Oxfam's governing body, comprises a minimum of ten and a maximum of 12 Trustees. They serve an initial term of three years that can be extended up to a maximum of six years. The Chair, Vice-Chair, and Treasurer may

also serve until the end of their term as Officers. The members of the company are known as the Association. This Association comprises all the Trustees plus a number of other members up to a maximum of 32. Members are appointed by Council and ratified by the Association. New Trustees are appointed by the Association on the recommendation of Council. Members of the Association have guaranteed the liabilities of the company up to £1.00 each.
A sub-committee of Council, the Recruitment and Development Group, is responsible for the recruitment and training of Trustees and Association members. Each year the Recruitment and Development Group issues a recruitment advertisement which is widely publicised in Oxfam publications, on the Oxfam website, and on a number of other specialist websites. Short-listed applicants are interviewed by a selection panel.
Trustee appointments are based on the need for Council to have the appropriate skills and experience to determine Oxfam policies and to monitor the implementation of those policies. Each new Trustee is linked with a serving Trustee and provided with a structured induction programme over the first year. As part of its ongoing training, Council has seminars on key areas, such as risk and accountability. The annual review of board performance includes input from the Chair's formal discussions with individual Trustees and from an appraisal of the Chair by all Trustees.
Oxfam's Trustees are responsible for everything that Oxfam does. However, to ensure Oxfam is managed efficiently and effectively, the Trustees have delegated a range of day-to-day decision-making powers to the Corporate Management Team (CMT), which reports directly to Council. Trustees have also established appropriate controls and reporting mechanisms to ensure that the CMT operates within the scope of the powers delegated to it. The delegation policy is updated on an ongoing basis and is formally reviewed and approved by Trustees every three years; the last review was in September 2008.The Trustees have reserved certain powers, which only they can exercise. These include those statutory powers that cannot be delegated, such as policies on investment and reserves, and decisions linked to major policy or programme initiatives, strategic planning and changes to organisational structure.
The Trustee Audit and Finance Group (TAFG), Oxfam's audit committee, chaired by the Treasurer, meets regularly with the external auditors, both with and without the presence of management. The group agrees the external audit plan, reviews the external auditor's management letter, and monitors implementation of actions required as a result. The TAFG also has the responsibility of ensuring that the audit, risk management and control processes within Oxfam are effective, and it has actively considered how Oxfam should apply the Turnbull guidance on internal control and the Smith


guidance on audit committees. The TAFG undertakes a detailed review of the draft Annual Plan, the Risk Register, the Annual Report and Accounts, and the Strategic Plan Update prior to their submission to Council. It approves the annual Internal Audit plan and oversees the work programme of the Internal Audit department and the control implications of Internal Audit reports.
One further committee that carries out specific functions on behalf of the Council is the Remuneration Committee, chaired by the Chair of Oxfam. This committee monitors the implementation of Oxfam's rewards policy (ie. the remuneration and benefits for Oxfam staff). It also specifically determines Oxfam's policy on the remuneration and benefits of members of the CMT.
Trustees are also involved in a number of other Oxfam committees, working groups, areas where a duty cannot legally be delegated and areas where there are specific issues around Oxfam's reputation. Committees include the Pension Committee and the Oxfam Activities Limited Board, both of which have at least one Trustee as a member.
In July 2006, the Trustees reviewed the governance of Oxfam in the light of the Code of Governance for the Voluntary and Community Sector in the UK (www.governancehub.org.uk). We comply with the seven principles of the Code in our UK operations, but the Code does not address the international operations of UK charities. There are a number of detailed standards in the Code, and we comply with most of them, although we consider that full compliance for some of the standards is not possible. We have our own complaints and public information policies.
The names of the members of the CMT, Council and the Association, and the committees they have served on, are available in the Corporate Directory (see page 3). The members of the CMT are not directors for the purposes of company law.
Trustees' statutory responsibilities
The Trustees are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Trustees to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Trustees have elected to prepare the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Trustees must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the company and of the surplus of deficit of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Trustees are required to:
· Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.

· Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
· State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
· Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charity will continue in business.
The Trustees confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the charity's and group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charity and the group, and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006, the Statement of Recommended Practice `Accounting and Reporting by Charities (revised in 2005)', other current statutory requirements and the governing document. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charity and the group, and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each Trustee confirms that: a) In so far as the Trustee is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which Oxfam's auditors are unaware.
b) The Trustee has taken all the steps that she/he ought to have taken as a Trustee in order to make herself/himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that Oxfam GB's auditors are aware of that information.
The maintenance and integrity of Oxfam's website is the responsibility of the Trustees; the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Public benefit
Charity trustees have a new duty to report in the Trustees' Annual Report on their charity's public benefit. They should demonstrate that:
1. They are clear about what benefits are generated by the activities of the charity. This report sets out in some detail the humanitarian, development and campaigning activities carried out to further each of Oxfam's five strategic aims.
2. The benefits must be related to the objects of the charity. All activities are intended to further Oxfam's charitable objects, which are for `the prevention and relief of poverty, distress and suffering'.


3. The people who receive support are entitled to do so according to criteria set out in the charity's objects. Wherever possible the views and opinions of people living in poverty are sought in the design and implementation of programmes of assistance. This approach helps to ensure that programmes are targeted to people in need, and that beneficial changes to the lives of poor people can be evaluated and assessed.
Trustees are therefore confident that Oxfam meets the public benefit requirements, and they confirm that they have taken into account the guidance contained in the Charity Commission's general guidance on public benefit where applicable.
Risk management
The Council of Trustees has overall responsibility for Oxfam's system of internal control. Such a system of control can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against inappropriate or ineffective use of resources, or against the risk of errors or fraud. These risks are further heightened, given the difficult nature of communications, institutional and financial infrastructure in some parts of the world where Oxfam operates. There is clear delegation of authority from Council through the Chief Executive and the CMT to the rest of the organisation. On an annual basis the major strategic and operational risks that Oxfam faces ­ and the ways in which they are being monitored, managed, and mitigated ­ are assessed by the CMT and considered by Council. Additionally, the CMT continues to assess the risks (as identified in the risk register) that Oxfam faces regularly during the year. This year, the CMT reported to Council on the current state of risk identification, analysis and monitoring practices within Oxfam GB to seek guidance on the future risk management approach. Council endorsed the general approach being taken but put more emphasis on clearer consideration of divisional risk.
The Internal Audit department carries out a programme of audits across all operations and activities. The audits undertaken cover all the major risk areas as identified by the CMT and Council, and the Head of Internal Audit submits regular reports to the TAFG, including an annual opinion on internal control. Action plans are developed by management to address any weakness in controls, and progress against these plans is regularly reported back to the TAFG. The CMT, via the Control Assurance report, provides Trustees with an annual opinion on the control environment. Both the external auditors (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) and the Head of Internal Audit meet annually with the TAFG in private session. Taken together, these processes ensure that major risks and key controls are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis by staff and skilled volunteers who act on behalf of the Trustees. The TAFG reports annually to Council on the control environment.

Council recognises that, to achieve the objectives of the charity, the nature of some of Oxfam's work requires acceptance of some risks which are outside Oxfam's control, ie. risk which cannot be eliminated or fully managed, but where this happens there is active and clear monitoring of the risk. Council considers that maintaining Oxfam's general reserves at the levels stated overleaf and reviewing key systems and processes carried out through an internal audit programme provide Oxfam with adequate risk assurance. The Council of Trustees is satisfied that systems are in place to monitor, manage, and mitigate Oxfam's exposure to major risks.
Communicating with staff and volunteers
Oxfam has well-established arrangements for consulting and involving staff in its work. Management and staff bodies negotiate terms and conditions of employment through the Staff Associations in countries outside the UK, and through the Oxfam Negotiating Committee in the UK. In Oxford, the CMT holds regular 'Have your Say' meetings to enable staff and volunteers to question them; this also now includes an international office by video conference on a rotational basis, and Oxfam has an electronic `Have your Say' so that all staff can raise questions and comment on issues of interest. There are many other formal and informal opportunities for consultation. All managers are expected to hold regular meetings with their staff, to provide an opportunity for communication of information and discussion of events as they develop. To keep staff and volunteers informed, Oxfam produces a monthly letter from the Chief Executive Officer, a monthly International Division bulletin, and a bi-monthly magazine for shop volunteers. Oxfam also maintains an intranet site that provides information to staff, including information about Oxfam's finances and its key performance indicators, and holds annual `Oxfam Live' events in locations around the UK.
Diversity and disability
Oxfam has a strong commitment to developing the diversity of its staff and volunteers through equal opportunity policies, training, targets and practical action. This includes encouraging applications from disabled people, developing their skills, and taking every reasonable measure to adapt our premises and working conditions to enable disabled people to work or volunteer with Oxfam.
Volunteers
More than 20,000 volunteers work in Oxfam shops, and thousands of others contribute their time to Oxfam in a variety of ways. Most make a regular commitment, ranging from a few hours to a full working week. Some use their professional expertise, while others give their time and energy in work that is not related to their everyday jobs. Some volunteers may be retired or not in paid employment. Oxfam tries to apply the principles of involvement and equality to its many volunteers.


Oxfam Scotland
We are required by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator to report separately upon the activities Oxfam has undertaken in Scotland. During 2008/09, we focused on campaigning for a world-leading Climate Change Bill in the Scottish Parliament; we worked with partners and approaches included lobbying, mass rallies and communicating through the Scottish media. We continued our work on increased public health and education provision in the developing world, by targeting the constituencies of the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development. Our campaigning included work with the Scottish public, as well as media relations and advocacy work with politicians from the Holyrood, Westminster and European Parliaments.
We also focused on tackling poverty and inequality in Scotland. In particular, we concentrated on ensuring that:
· Regeneration programmes and resources meet the often very different needs of women and men who experience poverty.
· Local communities have a proper stake in economic development and investment.
· Particularly vulnerable groups have their labour rights and incomes secured.
· The media portrays the issue of asylum in a more balanced and accurate manner.
We continued work on Development Education, alongside education authorities, the International Development Education Association of Scotland (IDEAS) network and other partners, to improve Scottish pupils' knowledge of international development and global citizenship. Fundraising in Scotland included the work of our network of shops, regular donations from the Scottish public and support from trusts and institutional funders. We were also involved in two major Disaster Emergency Committee campaigns with our colleagues in other aid agencies in Scotland.
Accountability
""Oxfam believes that in order to achieve our organisational mission and to ensure that our work has the greatest impact, we need to be accountable to our key stakeholders."" Barbara Stocking, Chief Executive, Oxfam
Being accountable is a key value for Oxfam, which strengthens our legitimacy and is vital to fulfilling our mission. All organisations need to take the views of their stakeholders into account and to seek to give an account back. As we demand increased accountability from others, we recognise that we need to become more accountable ourselves.
Oxfam defines accountability as the process through which an organisation balances the needs of stakeholders in its decision-making and activities, and

delivers against this commitment. Accountability is based on four dimensions: transparency, participation, learning and evaluation, and feedback mechanisms that allow the organisation to give account to, take account of, and be held to account by stakeholders. We hold ourselves primarily accountable to people living in poverty, but we take our accountability to all stakeholders seriously, and continuously strive to balance their different needs. Increased accountability will be achieved and demonstrated through respectful and responsible attitudes, appropriate systems and strong leadership.
The Accountability Report 2007/08 details our plans to become increasingly accountable over a three-year time period. The results of this work are highlighted throughout this Report and the following section details other key areas of progress in 2008/09. A full update is available at www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/accounts.
Programme
· Partner involvement in programme design and monitoring continued to increase, with reviews taking place in 55 per cent of programmes (against a 66 per cent target). Most of these included partners' views directly or indirectly in the process, and work has been undertaken to explore how to meaningfully involve affected populations in these reviews. The target is to complete reviews in 100 per cent of programmes in 2009/10.
· 63 per cent of all countries held a Country Learning Review (against a target of 66 per cent), many involving partners and external stakeholders.
· 29 per cent of regions completed a Regional Learning Review in line with the target. The remaining regions will complete a review in 2009/10.
· Three regions are piloting the inclusion of partner feedback in staff annual performance appraisals, in an attempt to improve accountability to partner organisations.
· Partners were actively involved in the process of setting indicators and collecting data for Oxfam's baseline report, Measuring Change, as part of its partnership agreement with the Department for International Development.
· Oxfam's Council of Trustees held strategic reviews into HIV and AIDS, and gender programming. They concluded that a stronger and more systematic gender focus in our campaigns work was needed.
· All new agreements and contracts with partner organisations will explicitly state specific commitments to partners.
· Oxfam published its programme evaluation policy, which stipulates that partners play a strong role in all evaluations, and that findings from these be shared with partners, affected populations and donors as appropriate.
· In order to foster and support increased accountability in programme responses we have produced a range of tools to support field staff: an accountability matrix,


an accountability toolkit with examples of best practice and case studies, a staff skills and resources pack for increased accountability and an accountability starter pack. These are available both internally and externally to other agencies.
Campaigning
· We continued to improve our monitoring, evaluation and learning capabilities in campaigns and advocacy, by embedding the use of the `impact chain' logical framework in three out of four main campaign areas.
· Working with international staff, we revised our model and approach to global campaigning, which will be used to guide campaign decision-making. This makes the role of partnerships and alliances more prominent, reflecting our commitment to drive change as part of social movements, and enabling partners to exercise their right to be heard.
· We entered the Global Campaign for Climate Action coalition, building in a clear exit strategy that was agreed by all parties.
· A management review of the implementation of the Partnership Policy in campaigns will be completed in autumn 2009.
The environment and climate change
· We made a further 3,816 tonne reduction in our UK carbon footprint ­ a 37 per cent reduction from the 2006/07 baseline.
· Due to the challenges encountered in obtaining consistent data from the many countries in which we operate, the decision was made not to pursue the objective of having a global target regarding our carbon footprint. As of May 2009, there is a requirement for each of the Regions to report quarterly on its own carbon reduction programme of targets and achievements.
· We initiated analysis of our supply chain that will highlight areas for detailed investigation and further action by mid-2009.
· The electricity supply contract with Ecotricity was renewed in March 2009. This contract continues to guarantee that 100 per cent of the electricity used in Oxfam House is from renewable sources. More than 37 per cent of the supply to the shops network is also from renewable sources.
· Investment in technology, policy changes and awareness-raising resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions from UK-booked passenger air travel by 4 per cent.
· Paper use continued to fall and was 49 per cent below 2006/07 levels. Emphasis has been on efficient design and alignment with the new BSI 2020 standard for direct marketing.
· Further progress in waste management led to the level of recycling rising to 51 per cent by April 2009.

Ethical purchasing
· All 75 commercial suppliers of retail products were managed according to our in-depth programme. 30 production sites completed the SEDEX selfassessment, and ten of these were audited.
· Our annual report for the World Wildlife Fund Global Forest and Trade Network (WWF-GFTN) detailed a number of significant improvements. We sourced 25 per cent Forest Stewardship Council marked retail products, exceeding our target of ten per cent. We expanded the scope of paper reported into the WWF-GFTN to include 25 per cent of paper purchased for non-retail purposes.
· Our 2009 WWF-GFTN targets are: ­ Incorporate an explicit statement in our ethical purchasing policy to address sustainable wood and paper sources. ­ Over 90 per cent of retail products sourced will be post consumer waste recycled or FSC marked. ­ Capture wood source data on 100 per cent of paper products sourced for UK operations.
Governance
· A KPMG review identified potential improvements to our arrangements for whistle-blowing. A new Loss Prevention Manager (appointed January 2009) will review reporting procedures, including whistleblowing, and offer support in reviewing procedures and investigating losses. Subject to Trustee approval, an action plan will be implemented during 2009/10.
· The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sector Supplement Group has produced draft guidelines for cross-sector accountability reporting. These are open for public consultation between June and September 2009, and the supplement is due for release in February 2010. As a pilot initiative this year, we have reported against the GRI draft  guidelines and have published them on our website.
We have now signed up to the International Advocacy Non-Governmental Organisations (IANGO) Charter and our compliance statement is incorporated in the GRI report which is available at www.oxfam.org.uk/accountability.
Conclusion
We remain committed to delivering the third and final year of our plans as set out in the Accountability Report 2006/07. We are pleased with the progress we have made up to this point but recognise that we still have a long way to go. If you have any comments or feedback please get in touch via our website www.oxfam.org.uk, email us at enquiries@oxfam.org.uk or write to the Company Secretary, Oxfam, Oxfam House, John Smith Drive, Cowley, Oxford, OX4 2JY, UK.


Finance summary
Income
Oxfam's total income increased by £8.6m to £308.3m in 2008/09. This income derives principally from the activities of trading and fundraising. Trading income grew by 2 per cent whilst fundraising income (which includes both income from supporters and the public, and institutional donor income) decreased by 2 per cent. Trading income represents 26 per cent of total income, which is a similar proportion to the last three years. The ratio of unrestricted to restricted fundraising income was 40:60, which is consistent with recent years. A detailed analysis of income is shown in the consolidated Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA) and Note 2 to the accounts.

*This represents Other Incoming Resources plus Primary Purpose Trading Income plus Investment Income less Investment Management Costs.

Trading sales increased by £1.6m this year to £79.3m. This represents continuing growth in sales of donated goods over the past five years and is a real achievement given the economic downturn. Sales were boosted by a full year's relationship with Marks & Spencer through the Clothes Exchange Scheme. Trading costs grew by 4 per cent during the year, causing trading net income to decrease by 4 per cent to £16.4m. Other net income collected through the shops, but which is not included in Trading income above, remained consistent with last year at £4.5m. Income from Oxfam Unwrapped sales at Christmas fell slightly compared to previous years at £2.6m.
Fundraised income decreased by £3.1m to £200.5m. This decline was mainly due to a 4 per cent decrease in unrestricted income from regular givers and legacies. Restricted income from governments and institutional

donors increased by 23 per cent, in particular, from other members of Oxfam International, due to greater working with other affiliates and a higher level of joint projects. Restricted voluntary income decreased by 9 per cent due primarily to the reduction in Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) funding for the Asian Tsunami, partially offset by a £10.8m increase in gifts-in-kind.
The cost of raising voluntary income, as shown in Note 3a, has decreased by almost 16 per cent to £19.8m during 2008/09. Net fundraised income is £180.7m, which is slightly higher than last year despite the economic downturn, and has delivered a net margin of 90 per cent.
Gifts-in-kind can fluctuate significantly, reflecting the scale and nature of emergency response in any year. This year's gifts-in-kind total of £19.4m mainly represents food aid for Kenya and Zimbabwe.
The Primary Purpose Trading includes the income from the sale of published materials and income generated by the subsidiary micro-credit scheme in Azerbaijan.
Other Incoming Resources this year includes a £2.8m exchange gain that mainly relates to the retranslation of our bank balances held in Euros at the end of April 2009, and £0.6m in respect of profits on disposal of fixed assets.
Expenditure
The Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA) shows the analysis of charitable expenditure between charitable activities (development, humanitarian, and campaigning and advocacy), governance costs and other resources expended. Total charitable expenditure has increased by 10 per cent to £235.8m. Unrestricted charitable spend has remained fairly constant, increasing only 4 per cent, whilst restricted charitable spend has increased by 15 per cent, mainly resulting from increased humanitarian work. The amount spent on support costs during the year increased by £2.8m (11 per cent), reflecting the increase in programme activity as well as exchange losses due to the weakening of sterling.
Further analysis of charitable activity expenditure, showing the operational activities undertaken by Oxfam and those undertaken by partners through grants from Oxfam, is given in Note 3c to the accounts.
The allocation of expenditure across the strategic aims of Oxfam has changed as a result of increased emergencies work and a relative increase in spend on the Right to Equity. As a consequence, the percentage spent on Sustainable Livelihoods and the Right to Basic Social Services has decreased. The relationship between our strategic aims and our charitable activities is also shown in Note 3c. The table overleaf shows the proportion of charitable expenditure spent on each charitable aim.

* Other Charitable Expenditure includes support costs, governance costs and other resources expended.

Our cash balances have reduced by £22.6m during the year to £45.7m at 30 April 2009, partially driven by the reduction in unrestricted reserves and partly because of £10m receivable in respect of gift aid claims submitted just before the year-end.
Reserves policy
The Council of Trustees has established a general Reserves Policy to protect the organisation and its charitable programme by providing time to adjust to changing financial circumstances. The Policy also provides parameters for future strategic plans and contributes towards decision-making. Oxfam's Reserves Policy establishes an appropriate target range for the level of general reserves; the target range for 2008/09 was established as between £33m and £37m. The range is based on a risk assessment of the probability and likely impact on Oxfam's charitable programme that might be caused by a decline in income, an inability to meet financial obligations, or an inability to reduce expenditure in the immediate short term. The Policy ensures a balance between spending the maximum amount of income raised as soon as possible after receipt, while maintaining the minimum level of reserves to ensure uninterrupted operation. The Policy and the target range are reviewed annually to reassess the risks and reflect changes in Oxfam's income, financial obligations and expenditure. The risks surrounding the pension liability have been taken into consideration when calculating the target range. Since Oxfam is confident that it can meet the required pension contributions from projected future income without significantly impacting on its planned level of charitable activity, it continues to calculate its `free' or general reserves without setting aside designated reserves to cover the pension liability.
General reserves (unrestricted)
General reserves are not restricted to or designated for a particular purpose. General reserves decreased by £9.9m during 2008/09, with the balance of general reserves being £34.7m by the end of April 2009. This decrease reflects the planned increase in unrestricted programme activity during 2008/09, which was planned given the high level of general reserves brought forward into the year (caused by several one-off income streams

in previous years). Our intention was to bring general reserves back into the target range of £33­37m by the end of April 2009, by once again allowing unrestricted programme expenditure to exceed unrestricted income during 2008/09, and this has been achieved. General reserves are represented by net current assets and are equivalent to approximately two and a half months' unrestricted expenditure at 2008/09 levels.
Pension reserves (unrestricted)
The valuation of Oxfam's pension scheme at 30 April 2009, for the purposes of FRS17, showed a funding deficit of £24.5m (2007/08: £13.0m), (see Note 20d). This deficit represents the difference between the liabilities of the pension fund and the value of its underlying assets; it does not represent an immediate cash commitment, as the cash flow required to meet the £24.5m deficit relates to future pension contributions. The valuation of the pension scheme's assets under FRS17 is different from the triennial actuarial valuation, which determines the pension contributions required to reduce the deficit. Current financial projections indicate that Oxfam will be able to make these contributions as they fall due. FRS17 requires a pension reserve to be established to meet the pension deficit. The defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new members during 2002/03.
Designated funds (unrestricted)
Designated funds are those unrestricted funds that have been allocated by the Trustees for particular purposes. The designated fund for fixed assets of £13.9m (2007/08: £14.1m) represents resources invested in the charity's fixed assets (excluding investments), that are, therefore, not available for other purposes. The second designated fund relates to retained profits of the microcredit scheme in Azerbaijan, which are only available in Azerbaijan and totalled £1.7m at the end of April 2009. Further details of the designated funds and their movements during the year are shown in Note 19 of the accounts.
Restricted funds
These funds are tied to particular purposes, as specified by the donor or as identified at the time of a public appeal. At the year-end, unspent restricted funds were £24.0m (2007/08: £27.4m). The restricted fund balance includes total deficit balances of £10.8m. These deficit balances have arisen on projects where total expenditure has exceeded income; it is expected that the expenditure will be reimbursed by a government or other agency in the following accounting year (see Note 18 for further details).
Endowment funds
Endowment funds of £2.4m (2007/08: £2.7m) represent monies received from donors where there is some restriction on the use of the capital (see Note 17).

Financial position
The Council of Trustees considers that there are sufficient reserves held at the year-end to manage any continued downturn in the UK and global economy. Given the unprecedented turmoil in financial markets and the global economy during the last year and in order to avoid disruption to planned programme activity, the Trustees have agreed to allow reserves to fall below the reserve range during 2009/10, with firm plans in place to return reserves to within the range over the next few years. The Trustees consider that there is a reasonable expectation that Oxfam has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason, the Council of Trustees continues to adopt the `going concern' basis in preparing the accounts.
Investment policy and performance
Our objective is to maintain high liquidity while ensuring maximum security, meeting our ethical standards and achieving the highest possible return. To meet this objective, during 2008/09 Oxfam has invested in fixed-term or call deposits with a high security rating and either fixed interest rates or a fixed relationship to base rate. During the year, the average return on these investments was 5.3 per cent compared with an average base rate of 3.3 per cent.
Financial risk management
Prices of goods and services purchased are subject to contracts with suppliers based on market prices, and salary costs are subject to a formal annual review. Our standard payment terms are 30 days. Credit risk on amounts owed by donors is low. In terms of liquidity risk, Oxfam GB has no borrowings, and our policies on the management of investments and reserves are set out above. Net exchange risk is kept under review and appropriate action taken to mitigate the risk.
Auditors
A resolution proposing the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Oxfam's auditors will be submitted at the Annual General Meeting.
Grant-making policies
In 2008/09 we spent £53.9m (2007/08: £53.4m) in grants to international, national and local partner organisations. We made 1,851 grants to 1,278 organisations (2007/08: 1,972 grants to 1,328 organisations). The average grant per project was £29,000 (2007/08: £27,000) and per partner was £42,000 (2007/08: £40,000). Oxfam works with and through others to take action to achieve common goals for overcoming poverty and injustice based on complementarity and respect for the contribution that each party brings. Oxfam's partner relations are informed by, and managed to, a set of clear principles. These five principles underpin our programme and

partnership decisions in development, humanitarian and campaigns work at every level of activity.
We hold ourselves accountable to these principles and seek to be held accountable by partners, communities and other stakeholders with whom we and our partners work. The five principles are:
· Complementary purpose and added value · Mutual respect for values and beliefs · Clarity on roles, responsibilities and decision-
making
· Transparency and accountability · Commitment and flexibility.
Before making a grant, Oxfam completes appraisals for the project and the proposed partner organisation. These ensure that there is a good strategic fit between Oxfam and the partner organisation, and that the project objectives are consistent with the principles listed above and reflect a coherent and well-designed project that will be a cost effective way of bringing about the intended impact.
Grants are managed through specific agreements with partners, which set out the conditions of the grant, including reporting requirements, and when and how disbursement will happen. The agreement also outlines Oxfam's responsibilities in the partnership to ensure that it can be held to account by partners and other stakeholders (see Accountability update, pages 37­38). Grants are usually disbursed in separate installments to ensure that agreed timings and results are being met and managed.
Oxfam staff monitor and evaluate progress throughout the period of the grant. The nature of these activities will depend on the size and complexity of the grant and the perceived level of risk. Monitoring and evaluation may include:
· Visits to the partners and beneficiaries · Formal evaluation processes such as impact
assessment by Oxfam or a third party
· Auditing of the project and/or the partner.
If we are not satisfied that the grant is being managed according to the partner agreement, we discontinue the grant.

Supporting the programme Trustees' Report 43

The year1 ahead
Planning for 2009/10 took place against the backdrop of the global economic crisis, which has implications both for Oxfam as an organisation and for poor people across the world. The recession means we will have to use our resources even more effectively, reducing our costs and activities where we can, while continuing to invest for the future (for example in our digital work and in our programme management skills and systems). The focus this year has to be on delivering results in our priority areas ­ as defined in the corporate objectives ­ and on working simply and effectively.
The following principles will continue to underpin the way we work:
· Putting women's rights at the heart of all we do · Improving our accountability to all stakeholders · Ensuring the diversity of our workforce and supporters · Our commitment to staff development and
internal promotion.
Corporate Objectives for 2009/10
1. Monitor and respond to the recession
· Influence the UK Government and multilateral responses to ensure that these meet the needs of poor people and include a focus on women.
· Ensure that Oxfam emerges from the recession in a strong position both financially and organisationally.
2. Work with others to campaign on climate change
· Influence the UN negotiations in Copenhagen in December 2009 to agree a fair and ambitious deal. The deal should guarantee support for developing countries to adapt to climate change while sustaining growth with equity, and keep temperature rise below 2°C.
3. Improve disaster preparedness and response
· Increase the quantity and quality of humanitarian assistance in emergencies by enhancing our own capacity and that of our partner organisations in 15 countries.
· Ensure that the increased vulnerability of women and men, as a result of both climate change and the global recession, is taken into account.
4. Strengthen our food security and agriculture programmes
· Influence local, regional and national governments and companies to deliver programmes and/or policies which support women's and men's smallholder production. These should take into account both the global economic crisis and the need for climate change adaptation.

· Increase our engagement with the private sector, to increase profit and power for small-scale producers in national and global supply chains. 5. Implement National Change Strategies
· Continue the implementation of National Change Strategies in all countries. These will have well-designed programme implementation plans and sound monitoring, evaluation and learning frameworks. They will have clear, expected results, and will take into account funding opportunities and threats from the global recession. 6. Raise income
· Achieve total income of £272.8m, with net funds of £194.8m available to the programme. 7. Deliver results
· Develop staff and volunteers' skills and ways of working, with a focus on delivering results through better project management, planning and processes, and the sharing of advice and best practice.

1 To bring us into line with Oxfam International and many of our affiliates, Oxfam is changing its year end to 31 March and therefore the next accounting period will be for 11 months to 31 March 2010. The numbers quoted in section 6 above reflect this shortened period.



Independent auditor's report to the Trustees and members of Oxfam

We have audited the financial statements of Oxfam for the year ended 30 April 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Financial Activities, the Consolidated and Parent Charity Balance Sheets, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
Respective responsibilities of trustees and auditors The Trustees' (who are also the Directors of the charity for the purposes of company law) responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts (including the financial statements) in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) and for being satisfied that the financial statements give a true and fair view are set out in the Statement of Trustees' Responsibilities.
We have been appointed auditors under section 44(1)(c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and under the Companies Act 2006 and report to you in accordance with those Acts.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the charity's members as a body in accordance with Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006, and to the charity's Trustees as a body in accordance with section 44(1) (c) of the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and regulation 10 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view, have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and Regulation 6 and 8 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Trustees' Report is consistent with those financial statements.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the charity has not kept adequate and proper accounting records, if the charity's financial statements are not in agreement with these accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other information comprises

only the Trustees' Report (pages 1­43) and the Acknowledgements on page 70. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to other information.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the Trustees in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's and the charity's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion In our opinion:
· the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent charity's affairs as at 30 April 2009 and of the group's incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure and cash flows, for the year then ended;
· the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
· the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 and Regulations 6 and 8 of the Charities Accounts (Scotland) Regulations 2006; and
· the information given in the Trustees' Report is consistent with the financial statements.
Notes to the financial statements
1. Accounting Policies
a. Accounting conventions The Trustees' Report and Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of investments at market value, and in compliance with Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice (Revised 2005) (`the SORP'), and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The charity has adjusted the formats from those prescribed by the Companies Act 2006, to include headings that are relevant to its activities, to enable it to show a true and fair view. No separate Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA) is presented for the charity itself as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and paragraph 397 of the SORP.
b. Basis of consolidation The financial statements of Oxfam's trading subsidiary company, Oxfam Activities Limited (OAL), are consolidated with the accounts of Oxfam on a line-by-line basis.
Oxfam holds a special non-redeemable £1 share in Coffee Producers Company Limited. This company exists to allow coffee producers' cooperatives to hold an interest in Progreso Cafés Limited. The special share provides Oxfam with super voting rights and the consent of the special shareholder is required to appoint directors and change the nature of the business of Coffee Producers Company Limited. The company is not consolidated on the grounds of materiality.
Oxfam also has an interest in Coffee Producers' Trust by way of appointment of the majority of the Trustees. The object of the Trust, amongst others, is of strengthening the influence, income and security of coffee producing companies anywhere in the world. The Trust is not consolidated on the grounds of materiality.
Oxfam operates a micro credit scheme, Finance for Development Limited, in Azerbaijan, which has been registered as a separate organisation. As a subsidiary of Oxfam its accounts have been consolidated on a line-by-line basis. Details are given in Note 9.
Oxfam Activities Limited holds a 25% shareholding (one £1 ordinary share) in The Guardian Share Company Limited. This company is equally owned by the four founders of Cafédirect and has a right to nominate a director to the Cafédirect Board. The consent of the Guardian Share Company is also required for the appointment of the Chair of the Board and for any changes to Cafédirect's Gold Standard. The accounts of this associated company have not been included on the grounds of materiality.
Oxfam Activities Limited also has a 50% shareholding in Frip Ethique. This joint venture has not been consolidated on the grounds of materiality. Details are given in Note 9.
Oxfam Activities Limited holds a 10% shareholding in Cafédirect. Cafédirect is not considered an associate and has not been consolidated.
Oxfam has a less than 10% membership of the Board of Oxfam International Tsunami Fund (OITF),

by only having one member of the board out of a total of twelve. OITF is not considered an associate and has not been consolidated.
To comply with overseas local legislation, Oxfam has established 100% owned subsidiaries and other overseas legal entities in a number of countries. These are fully controlled by Oxfam and their accounts are included within the accounts of Oxfam.
c. Fund accounting General funds are unrestricted funds that are available for use at the trustees' discretion in furtherance of the objectives of the charity.
Designated funds are set aside at the discretion of the trustees for specific purposes. They would otherwise form part of the other unrestricted funds.
In accordance with FRS17 ­ Retirements Benefits, a pension reserve is included within unrestricted funds to meet the pension deficit.
Restricted and endowment funds are subject to specific restrictions imposed by the donor or by the nature of an appeal.
A final review of the allocation of expenditure is performed after a project or contract has been completed, which can give rise to a transfer between funds.
d. Incoming resources Income, including donations, legacies and investment income, is recognised in the period in which Oxfam is entitled to receipt and where the amount can be measured with reasonable certainty.
Grants from governments and other agencies have been included as incoming resources from charitable activities where these amount to a contract for services but as voluntary income where the money is given in response to an appeal.
Income received in the year has been deferred in respect of specific fundraising events taking place after the year end. In addition the income relating to certain fixed assets held under leasehold agreements has been deferred and is being released to the Statement of Financial Activities over the period up to the break clause of the relevant lease of these assets.
Recognition of legacy income is dependent on the type of legacy, with pecuniary legacies recognised when notification is received and residuary legacies when the final accounts under the will are received. Reversionary legacies are not recognised during the lifetime of the original beneficiary under the will.
Gifts in kind ­ Food aid, for which Oxfam accepts full responsibility for distribution, is included in `Voluntary income' at its market value when it is distributed, and under `Charitable activities' at the same value and time.
Gifts in kind ­ Properties, investments, and other fixed assets donated to the charity are included as `Voluntary income' at market value at the time of receipt.
Donated services and facilities are included as `Voluntary income' at their estimated value to the charity when
received, and under the appropriate expenditure heading depending on the nature of service or facility provided, at the same value and time.
Income from `Gift Aid' tax reclaims is recognised for any `Gift Aid' certificates received up to a month after the year-end, in relation to donations made prior to the year-end.
In many cases costs are incurred on projects before the relevant restricted income is received. Therefore, unless contrary to a donor's wishes, interest income generated from restricted funds is treated as unrestricted to cover the prefinancing costs incurred.
Income from endowments is either restricted or unrestricted, depending on the conditions attached to the endowment when provided.
e. Costs of generating funds Costs of generating funds comprise the costs incurred in commercial trading activities, fundraising and managing investments. Trading costs cover all the costs of the shops and other trading activities including the costs of goods sold. Fundraising costs include the costs of advertising, producing publications, printing and mailing fundraising material, staff costs in these areas, and an appropriate allocation of central overhead costs. Investment management costs represent staff costs.
f. Charitable expenditure Charitable expenditure is reported as a functional analysis of the work undertaken by the charity, being humanitarian, development and campaigning and advocacy. Under these headings are included grants payable and costs of activities performed directly by the charity together with associated support costs.
Grants payable in furtherance of the charity's objects are recognised as expenditure when payment is due to the partner organisation in accordance with the terms of the contract. Standard partner contracts are typically for a year's duration, but can span several years. The contracts contain conditions, the fulfilment of which is under the control of Oxfam. For contracts in place at the year-end which include payments to be made in future years, these payments are disclosed in note 20 to the accounts as commitments.
Costs of activities in furtherance of the charity's objects are accounted for as they are incurred. These activities include campaigning, advocacy and capacity building together with humanitarian aid and development programme expenditure, which are delivered directly by Oxfam staff and costs associated with the local management of Oxfam's programme.
g. Governance costs Governance costs represent the salaries, direct expenditure, and overhead costs incurred by directorate, central finance, legal, corporate communications, and internal audit departments in the strategic planning processes of the charity and compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements.
h. Allocation and apportionment Costs to be recharged to specific activities or departments within the charity are apportioned on the following bases:
Buildings costs are allocated on the basis of floor area used.

In-house printing and warehousing are allocated to user departments on the basis of units of output.
Information systems costs are allocated on the basis of computer numbers.
The cost of the directorate, central finance, human resources and legal departments are allocated on the basis of employee numbers after an appropriate proportion has been allocated to Governance costs.
Irrecoverable VAT is allocated to the principal areas in which it is incurred namely fundraising income and campaigns.
Support costs represent the costs of providing direct support to Oxfam's programme by staff based in regional centres and in the UK as well as central costs, which include central finance, central human resources and corporate communications.


Furniture, fixtures, and equipment overseas 3 years

Vehicles and equipment used in programmes overseas are considered to have a useful economic life of one year or less. They are not capitalised but are charged in full to charitable expenditure when purchased.
Where appropriate, provision has been made for impairment in the value of tangible fixed assets.

j. Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments include freehold properties that Oxfam is required to retain until conditions specified by the donor have been met. The consequence of these conditions is that it is unlikely that Oxfam will be able to realise its investment in the foreseeable future. Included in this are properties where the proceeds, once realised, will be used for charitable purposes, rather than reinvestment. These fall within the definition of current asset investments given in the SORP. However, due to the specific circumstances relating to these properties the trustees consider it more appropriate to classify them as fixed asset investments.
Investment property and listed investments are included in the Balance Sheet at market value. Unlisted investments are included at cost as an approximation to market value unless there is specific evidence to the contrary. Investments in subsidiaries are included in the charity's accounts at cost.

52 Accounts for the year ending 30 April 2009

Programme-related investments are investments made directly in pursuit of Oxfam's charitable purposes. The Oxfam Activities Limited shareholdings in Cafédirect, The Guardian Share Company Limited and Frip Ethique are treated as programme-related investments in the Oxfam Group accounts and are included in the Balance Sheet at the amount invested less impairment. Oxfam's investment in Finance for Development Limited is treated on the same basis in the charity's accounts but the company has been consolidated in the group accounts.
Gains or losses arising on disposal or revaluation of investments are credited or charged to the Statement of Financial Activities under `Gains and losses on investment assets'.
k. Stocks Bought-in goods are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Unsold donated items are not included in closing stock since their cost is nil and their value is uncertain until sold.
Humanitarian supplies are valued at cost, with obsolete stock written off. Goods in-transit to overseas projects are removed from stock and included in programme expenditure when released from the warehouse.
l. Provisions In general, provisions for future liabilities are recognised when Oxfam has a legal or constructive financial obligation, that can be reliably estimated and for which there is an expectation that payment will be made.
m. Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Foreign currency balances are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses incurred in respect of our overseas operations are included in the SOFA within charitable activity expenditure for the period in which they are incurred. The net of all other foreign exchange gains and losses are included either in `Other incoming resources' if it is a net gain or `Other resources expended' if it is a net loss.

n. Pension scheme Oxfam operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The pension liabilities and assets are recorded in line with FRS17, with a valuation undertaken by an independent actuary. FRS17 measures the value of pension assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet date, determines the benefits accrued in the year and the interest on assets and liabilities. The value of benefits accrued is used to determine the pension charge in the Statement of Financial Activities and the expected return on scheme assets and interest cost on scheme liabilities are allocated across the appropriate incoming/outgoing resource categories. The change in value of assets and liabilities arising from asset valuation, changes in benefits, actuarial assumptions, or change in the level of deficit attributable to members is recognised in the Statement of Financial Activities within actuarial gains/ losses on defined benefit pension schemes. The resulting pension liability or asset is shown on the Balance Sheet. Quoted securities have been valued at current bid price.
Defined contribution scheme Pension contributions are charged to the Statement of Financial Activities as incurred.
o. Micro credit schemes Oxfam provides funds under micro credit schemes either direct to individual members of local communities or via local community groups. Oxfam generally retains a responsibility for managing these schemes until such time as it is possible to transfer the management responsibility to the local community. Under SORP 2005, these micro credit schemes are treated as programme-related investments within Oxfam's individual company accounts. Within the group accounts, micro credit schemes are consolidated on a line-by-line basis where material, with loans received and given out reflected in creditors and debtors respectively.
Details of the micro credit scheme, which is a locally registered organisation, are given in note 9 to the accounts.
p. Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the SOFA as incurred over the term of the lease.

May 2008
Report of the Working Group on Access to Environmental Justice

Foreword

When it signed up to  nearly a decade ago the United Kingdom undertook to ensure that ordinary members of the public who wished to pursue environmental law challenges should have access to procedures that were ""fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive"".
Few would dispute that our procedures in the Administrative Court, while by no means perfect, are, for those who can afford to use them, ""fair and equitable""; and despite the pressures on the Administrative Court's list, they are capable of being ""timely"" in really urgent cases. But who, apart from the very rich or the very poor, can afford to use them? For the ordinary citizen, neither wealthy nor impecunious, can there be any real doubt that the Court's procedures are prohibitively expensive?

Hesitant steps have been taken to remedy the imbalance. This report discusses the extent to which current approaches to costs and case management in judicial review, including a more generous use of Protective Costs Orders, might be developed to provide more assistance in environmental challenges. Unless more is done, and the Court's approach to costs is altered so as to recognise that there is a public interest in securing compliance with environmental law, it will only be a matter of time before the United Kingdom is taken to task for failing to live up to its obligations under Aarhus.
The Hon. Mr Justice Sullivan Royal Courts of Justice

One of the refreshing aspects of EC law, and environmental law in particular, is that it challenges too ready an acceptance of the adequacy of our own domestic law, and compels us to see our own legal system as others in the EC see it. Our current costs rules may well strike a fair balance in private law cases, where individuals are pursuing their own private interests in litigation, but they take no account of the recognition in Aarhus that there is a public interest in ensuring that environmental laws are not contravened. Unless it is changed, our costs regime will perpetuate the inevitable inequality of arms between the publicly funded bodies that take decisions in the environmental field and the individuals and environmental groups who have to rely on their own resources if they wish to challenge those decisions.

Aarhus and access to justice

Claimants without legal aid

1.

The third pillar of 

is concerned with access to environmental justice.

It gives rights to members of the public, including

environmental organisations, to challenge the legality

of decisions by public authorities to grant consent for

a wide range of activities as well as any other acts

or omissions that are contrary to the provisions of

national laws relating to the environment. Article 9(4)

of the Convention requires that procedures for rights

to access must ""provide adequate and effective

remedies, including injunctive relief as appropriate

and be fair, equitable, timely, and not prohibitively

expensive"".

2.

The UK government has ratified the Aarhus

Convention and is largely relying on existing judicial

review procedures to fulfil these access to environ-

mental justice requirements. The liberal approach

generally taken by the courts in England and Wales

to questions of standing for judicial review in environ-

mental cases reflects the Aarhus obligations in this

respect.

3.

We consider that the requirement under

Aarhus that procedures must not be prohibitively

expensive is not limited to the court fees involved in

making a judicial review application, but is related to

the total costs of making an application including the

exposure to the risk of costs should the application

fail. These cost requirements equally apply to the

obtaining of interim injunctive relief, which can be of

critical environmental importance where irreparable

or significant damage may be caused before the full

case is heard.

Legal aid

5.

But legal aid cannot be relied on as the

only funding mechanism to secure compliance with

Aarhus. Overall, we consider that the costs, whether

actual or risked, would be ""prohibitively expensive"" if

they would reasonably prevent an `ordinary' member

of the public who would not be entitled to legal aid

from embarking on the challenge falling within the

terms of Aarhus, including obtaining any appropriate

interim relief.

6.

We doubt whether for a significant number of

members of the public or non-governmental organi-

sations the current practices concerning costs in

environmental judicial review cases ­ and especially

the uncertainties and potential exposure to the costs

of the other parties involved should an application fail

­ can be said to be consistent with Aarhus. Our view

concurs with a recent comparative study on access

to environmental justice commissioned by the Euro-

pean Commission which concluded that the UK was

one of only five Member States whose provisions on

access to environmental justice under Aarhus were

unsatisfactory.

7.

Aarhus does not entitle members of the

public to bring frivolous or unwarranted claims, and

the requirement for permission for judicial review will

remain an important stage of the procedure. But to

those cases to which it applies, the Aarhus Conven-

tion does imply a fresh evaluation of conventional

approaches to costs issues in public law cases.

Throughout this report we have deliberately focused

on measures that could be introduced without undue

difficulty within the existing procedural framework

for judicial review, and which, if adopted, would go a

long way to meeting the requirements of Aarhus.

4.

Aarhus expressly recognises that the public

may need assistance in order to secure their rights to

environmental justice. In this context the availability

of legal aid under the Community Legal Service will

remain significant in securing access to environ-

mental justice for individuals in many environmen-

tal cases. We are pleased that the Legal Services

Commission has now made explicit reference to the

requirements of Aarhus in its guidance on legal aid.

4
Executive Summary

8.

Arrangements under which each party

agrees to bear its costs whatever the result may

continue to be appropriate for some types of environ-

mental judicial review cases, particularly those involv-

ing larger environmental organisations. But such an

approach is unlikely to be appropriate to be applied

in all environmental cases to which Aarhus applies.

Provided that the overall level of costs including the

risk and uncertainties of exposure does not make

litigation prohibitively expensive, some exposure to

costs can provide an important incentive to ensure

commitment by the claimant and avoid frivolous

claims.

Protective Costs Orders

9.

The availability of a Protective Costs Order

(PCO) at an early stage in proceedings can provide

an important mechanism in meeting the require-

ments on access to justice, in that a PCO provides a

cap and advance certainty on the potential exposure

to costs should an application fail. But the current

judicial principles on PCOs were not developed with

Aarhus in mind, and contain constraints that are not

consistent with Aarhus.

11. The Aarhus requirements that procedures are not prohibitively expensive are not confined only to cases once they have been granted permission, but will equally apply to the claimant while establishing whether a case does have merit. Costs at the permission stage should be proportionate, and in the case of Aarhus claims should generally be set at a very modest level.
Limited companies as claimants and security for costs
12. Case law has held that it is acceptable for members of the public to form a limited company to act as a claimant in judicial review cases, and this can provide a valuable mechanism to reduce personal exposure to costs. In such cases, issues concerning costs should the case fail are generally dealt with by the provision of advanced security for costs. For environmental cases to which Aarhus applies, the level at which security is set should reflect the requirements of Aarhus that the procedures are not prohibitively expensive.
Cost awards against defendants

10. Rather than reformulate the general principles of PCOs, specific principles concerning PCOs should be applied to those environmental judicial reviews to which Aarhus applies. It would follow that in a case falling within the terms of Aarhus and where a PCO is sought, the overarching requirement must be for a PCO that secures compliance with Aarhus. Conditions relating to the requirement of `general public importance' and `no private interest' that might still be applicable to PCOs in other types of cases but which are inconsistent with Aarhus would not apply. If the individual Aarhus claimant, acting reasonably in the circumstances, would be prohibited by the level of costs or cost risks from bringing the case, then the court must make some form of PCO to ensure compliance.

13. As to principles concerning the award of costs against defendants where an application is successful, the general rule that costs follow the event should continue to apply. But Aarhus should be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to depart from the normal rule. In particular, the court should be more reluctant to depart from the general rule where a claimant has been substantially successful in an environmental challenge ­ especially where the court has agreed with the claimant's analysis of the law in play but then withheld relief on discretionary grounds.

5
Executive Summary

Interim injunctions
14. The Aarhus requirements that procedures are not prohibitively expensive also apply to applications for interim relief such as injunctions, and Aarhus recognises the importance of injunctions to protect the environment. The normal requirement that a claimant for an interim injunction provides a cross-undertaking in damages should no longer apply to an Aarhus case where the injunction is necessary to prevent significant environmental damage taking place before the full case is heard. In such cases, it is incumbent on the court and its administration to ensure that the full case is heard as quickly as possible to reduce potential unfairness to third parties, and is consistent with the requirements for timeliness under Aarhus.
Timeliness
15. Aarhus requires that procedures are ""timely"" and the current lengthy delays in the Administrative Court are of particular concern in the environmental field. Very urgent cases are expedited, but this delays the less urgent environmental challenges still further. Unless something is done to speed up the judicial review process overall, there is a real risk that the Court's procedures will not comply with Aarhus in terms of timeliness.
Improved case management
16. The case management of judicial reviews to which Aarhus applies can be strengthened, assisting in early resolution of Aarhus issues and reducing the overall costs of environmental litigation for all parties involved. The parties and the judge involved need access to basic and easily identifiable information at an early stage, and guidance should be developed on the sort of information that all potential parties should be expected to seek or to provide in a case to which Aarhus applies.
17. Public authorities responding to a request for information in a pre-action protocol letter should comply with the duty of candour and timescales required under the Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, and avoid treating such requests as applications under the Environmental Information Regulations or Freedom of Information Act.

18. Judicial consideration of the orders needed to comply with Aarhus requirements should be considered at the earliest stage possible that an Aarhus case reaches the court. Particularly at these initial stages, Aarhus judicial reviews should be handled by judges with experience and expertise in environmental law. This will provide an important safeguard for all parties concerned that only cases of sufficient merit go forward and that they do so on an appropriate basis in line with Aarhus.
Implementation of recommendations
19. These principles should eventually be reflected within a Practice Direction and/or the Civil Procedure Rules, but it may be preferable if they were introduced initially by the judiciary in the Administrative Court under their discretionary powers. This would allow for a period of practical experience and learning before their codification.
Numbers of Aarhus cases and cost implications
20. The recommendations in this report are likely to lead to some increase in the numbers of legitimate environmental judicial reviews. But whatever the position on costs, litigation is resource intensive and a matter of last resort. Our judgement is that any increase will be modest and can be handled by the Administrative Court, especially if our recommendations on improved case management are adopted.
21. It also needs to be recognised that compliance with Aarhus ­ and the re-evaluation of conventional costs principles that it implies ­ will inevitably impose some extra costs on individual public authorities and third parties who are involved in environmental judicial reviews. These costs, though, have to be set against the goal of improving the protection of the environment that underlies the Aarhus requirements on access to environmental justice.

Background

1 Background

1.

A Working Group under the chairmanship of

Mr Justice Sullivan was convened in October 2006 to

consider issues of access to legal justice in envi-

ronmental matters in England and Wales. Members

of the Working Group have acted in their individual

capacity, but bring together a wide range of relevant

legal experience and expertise gained from the di-

verse perspectives relevant to environmental judicial

review (JR), including that of claimants (both individu-

als and environmental organisations), public authority

defendants, interested third parties such as develop-

ers, the judiciary, and the wider public interest.

2.

Our remit was:

(1) To consider whether current law and practice

creates barriers to access to justice in environmental

matters in the context of .

(2) To make practical recommendations for changes

in law and/or practice that might overcome any such

barriers.

3.

There have, in recent years, been a number

of publications and evaluations of relevance to our

work. These include:

(1) Using the Law: Barriers and Opportunities for

Environmental Justice (Capacity Global).

(2) Environmental Justice (the Environmental Justice

Project comprising the Environmental Law Founda-

tion, Leigh, Day & Co Solicitors and WWF-UK).

(3) Civil Law Aspects of Environmental Justice (Envi-

ronmental Law Foundation).

(4) Modernising Environmental Justice ­ Regulation

and the Role of an Environmental Tribunal (Macrory

and Woods).

(5) Access to Justice: Making it Affordable (Coalition for Access to Justice for the Environment). (6) Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Professor Nicolas de Sadeleer, CEDRE). (7) Litigating the Public Interest ­ Report of the Working Group on Facilitating Public Interest Litigation (Liberty and the Civil Liberties Trust). (8) In addition to these reports, in October 2007 the European Commission published a report entitled Measures on Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Article 9(3)), which addressed the issue of access to environmental justice in the 25 EU Member States, including the UK.

4.

Our focus has been on judicial review as a

legal remedy and on the operation of the Administra-

tive Court. The legal cases involved are thus those by

which people (whether individuals, groups or organi-

sations) challenge the decisions, actions or inaction

of public authorities. In the context of environmental

challenges, the bodies in question will include central

government, local authorities and regulators such as

the Environment Agency. Very often the focus of the

challenge will be some form of consent given by one

of those bodies to enable an activity which is alleged

to cause environmental harm; or the failure by such

bodies to take action in relation to the harm alleged

to be caused by such activities.

5.

We have concentrated on identifying meas-

ures that can be taken relatively easily and quickly

within the existing legal framework. Although more

substantial changes may be needed in the longer

term, they have not been the focus of our work and

they can be considered if and when our recommen-

dations have been implemented.

he UNECE Aarhus Convention on infor-

mation, public participation in decision making and

access to justice in environmental matters entered

into force in October 2001. It was ratified by the UK

in February 2005, and by the EC in the same month.

As of September 2007, there were 41 parties to the

Convention.

7.

The preamble to the Convention includes the

following:

Affirming the need to protect, preserve and improve the state of the environment and to ensure sustainable and environmentally sound development,

Recognising that adequate protection of the environment is essential to human well-being and the enjoyment of basic human rights, including the right to life itself,

Recognising also that every person has the right to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, and the duty, both individually in association to others, to protect and improve the environment for the benefit of present and future generations,

Considering that, to be able to assert this right and observe this duty, citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters, and acknowledging in this regard that citizens may need assistance in order to exercise their rights,

Recognising that, in the field of the environment, improved access to information and public participation in decision-making enhance the quality and the implementation of decisions, contribute to public awareness of environmental issues, give the public the opportunity to express its concerns and enable public authorities to take due account of such concerns,

Concerned that effective judicial mechanisms should be accessible to the public, including organisations, so that its legitimate interests are protected and the law is enforced.

8.

Article 9 contains two broad rights of access

to environmental justice that are of concern to us.

First, under Art 9(2) members of the public having

a sufficient interest10 must have access to a court

of law or other independent and impartial body to

challenge the substantive and procedural legality of

a decision to permit a proposed activity specified in

Annex I as well as other proposed activities not listed

but which are determined by a party to the conven-

tion to have significant effects on the environment.

The Annex I list contains some 19 classes of activi-

ties, including chemical installations, waste manage-

ment facilities, intensive agriculture, and motorway

construction, and is similar to those installations

subjects to environmental assessment under EC law.

Second, and in addition to these rights, under 9(2)

members of the public, where they meet the criteria,

if any, laid down in national law, must ""have access

to administrative or judicial procedures to challenge

acts or omissions by private parties and public au-

thorities which contravene provisions of its national

laws relating to the environment"".

 In line with the Convention's procedures the UK became a full party to the Convention in May 2005, 90 days after the date of ratification.

 Art 9(1) also contains a right to challenge the refusal to grant a request for environmental information. This right of appeal, now handled by the Information Commissioner, is not the focus of this report. 10 Or alternatively, maintaining impairment of a right where this is required by the administrative law of a party to the Convention. As the Aarhus Implementation Guide to the Convention indicates, this alternative was devised for those countries with legal systems that require a person's rights to be impaired before they can gain standing: ""Considering the clause's purpose, it is not an invitation for Parties to introduce such a fundamental legal requirement where it does not already exist, and to do so would in any case run foul of article 3 (6) of the Convention"" (p 129).

8


In relation to challenges to consent decisions, Article 9(2) expressly provides that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) promoting environmental protection and meeting any requirements under national law are deemed to have sufficient interest. The additional more general right under 9(3) to challenge contraventions of national environmental law refers only to members of the public, but we agree with the conclusion of the Aarhus Compliance Committee that this should not be read to exclude non-governmental organisations.11

9.

Article 9(4) then provides that the procedures

for rights of access to justice under 9(2) and 9(3) shall

""provide adequate and effective remedies, including

injunctive relief as appropriate, and be fair, equita-

ble, timely, and not prohibitively expensive"". It is this

requirement, and in particular the obligation to ensure

that procedures, including those for injunctive relief,

are not prohibitively expensive, that has been the

main concern of the Working Group.

10. Aarhus is an international convention, and the parties to the convention have established a Compliance Committee that can investigate alleged instances of non-compliance. But the European Community has also ratified Aarhus, giving the European Commission the right to ensure that Member States comply with the Aarhus obligations in areas within Community competence,12 using its enforcement mechanisms under Article 226 of the Treaty, which can eventually lead to action before the European Court of Justice.

11. The Working Group is also conscious that the provisions concerning access to justice have now been inserted into two key EC environmental directives. Art 10A of the 1985 EC Directive on Environmental Assessment13 provides that Member States must ensure that members of the public have access to a review procedure before a court of law or other independent body to challenge the substantive or procedural decisions, acts or omissions subject to the public participation provisions of the Directive, and that ""any such procedure shall be fair, equitable, timely, and not prohibitively expensive"".14 Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, which provides for a consent system for a wide range of industrial activities, is similarly amended with a new Article 15a, which also provides that procedures for legal challenges must be fair, equitable, timely, and not prohibitively expensive.
12. The Aarhus requirements concerning access to justice are therefore not simply a matter of obligation under international public law, but are now requirements under European Community law. As a matter of Community law, Member States have a duty to ensure that they are given effect, and in line with the developing jurisprudence of the European of Court of Justice, this would include the national courts where they have the power to do so.15

11 ""The Parties may not take the clause ""where they meet the criteria, if any, laid down in its national law"" as an excuse for introducing or maintaining so strict criteria that they effectively bar all or almost all environmental organizations from challenging acts or omissions that contravene national law relating to the environment."" Report to 12th Meeting of Compliance Committee, 14-16 June 2006 concerning Communication ACCC/C/2005/11 (Belgium) at para 35. 12 See Commission v France Case C-239/03 2004 ECR I-09325.

13 Inserted by Directive 2003/35/EC of 26 May 2003. 14 The Working Group is aware that the European Commission is currently investigating a complaint as to whether JR in England and Wales meet these requirements under the Directive. 15 See, for example, Factortame (I) (Case C-213/89), Landelijke Vereniging (Case C-72/95), and Kraaijeveld (Case C-437/97) esp. at para 55 : ""It should be recalled that the obligation of a Member State to take all the measures necessary to achieve the result prescribed by a directive is a binding obligation imposed by the third paragraph of Article 189 of the EC Treaty and by the directive itself (see Case 51/76 Verbond van Nederlandse Ondernemingen [1977] ECR 113, paragraph 22, and Case 152/84 Marshall [1986] ECR 723, paragraph 48). That duty to take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, is binding on all the authorities of Member States including, for matters within their jurisdiction, the courts.""

9


13. The only significant judicial observations to date on the application and effect of those provisions of the Convention in the UK were from the Court of Appeal (Brooke LJ) dealing with costs in Burkett16 thus:
""74 ... The 1998 Aarhus Convention, to which this country is a party, contains provisions on access to justice in environmental matters. (The full title is the ""UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters"".) In particular, it requires each signatory to have in place judicial procedures allowing members of the public to challenge acts of public authorities that contravene laws relating to the environment; and that those procedures should be ""fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive"" (para 4).
""75. A recent study of the environmental justice system (Environmental Justice: a report by the Environmental Justice Project, sponsored by the Environmental Law Foundation and others) recorded the concern of many respondents that the current costs regime ""precludes compliance with "". It also reported, in the context of public civil law, the view of practitioners that the very limited profit yielded by environmental cases has led to little interest in the subject by lawyers ""save for a few concerned and interested individuals"". It made a number of recommendations, including changes to the costs rules, and the formation of a new environmental court or tribunal.

""76. We would be troubled if the effect of our ruling on this appeal were left uncorrected by other means, because of the importance of maintaining the viability of the few legal practices which operate in the field of publicly funded environmental litigation. On the other hand, if the figures revealed by this case were in any sense typical of the costs reasonably incurred in litigating such cases up to the highest level, very serious questions would be raised as to the possibility of ever living up to the Aarhus ideals within our present legal system. And if these costs were upheld on detailed assessment, the outcome would cast serious doubts on the cost-effectiveness of the courts as a means of resolving environmental disputes.
""80. We would strongly welcome a broader study of this difficult issue, with the support of the relevant government departments, the professions and the Legal Services Commission. However, it is important that such a study should be conducted in the real world, and should look at the issue not only from the point of view of the lawyers involved, but also taking account of the likely practical benefits to their clients and the public. It may be thought desirable to include in such a study certain issues that relate to a quite different contemporary concern (which did not arise on the present appeal), namely that an unprotected claimant in such a case, if unsuccessful in a public interest challenge, may have to pay very heavy legal costs to the successful defendant, and that this may be a potent factor in deterring litigation directed towards protecting the environment from harm.""
We hope that our recommendations can form at least part of the wider evaluation that the Court of Appeal had in mind.

16 R (on the application of Sonia Burkett) v London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham [2004] EWCA Civ 1342.



3 Is the UK in compliance with Aarhus on access to environmental justice?

""In conclusion, it can be said that the potential costs of bringing an application for judicial review to challenge the acts or omissions of public authorities is a significant obstacle to access to justice in the United Kingdom.""

14. The UK government is currently largely relying on the judicial review process as fulfilling the Aarhus requirements on access to justice: ""Our administrative and judicial systems are fully compliant with the requirements for access to review.""17 The liberal approach generally taken by the courts in England and Wales to questions of standing for judicial review in environmental cases reflects the Aarhus obligations in this respect. It has not been suggested that the procedures for obtaining judicial review are inherently unfair or inequitable. In really urgent cases they are capable of being ""timely"" (though see further below at paras 82 and 84). But we doubt whether, for a significant number of non-legally aided claimants, the current procedures can be said to meet the general requirement that they are ""not prohibitively expensive"".
15. Our concerns are reinforced by a recently published comparative study on EU Member States and access to justice in environmental matters, commissioned by the EC. In relation to the UK the report concluded:
""...the main obstacle to access to justice for members of the public or NGOs is the issue of costs in judicial review cases. The problem is one of exposure and of uncertainty. At the beginning of a case it is impossible for the member of the public or the NGO to know how much money they will have to find if they lose. The possibility of having to pay a large (and uncertain) bill means that people are unwilling to risk bringing legal proceedings to hold a public body to account for breaking the law. Studies have indicated that a substantial number of potential applicants for judicial review in environmental matters have not proceeded because of the risk of costs involved ...
16. The report concluded that costs of procedures were considered to constitute an obstacle to access to justice in 12 EU Member States, including the UK. When linked to problems of obtaining interim relief, the UK was one of only five countries18 considered to be unsatisfactory overall.
17. The Working Group was also able to examine the position in a number of EU states: France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.19 This confirmed our own view, and that of the EC study, that the current UK position does not meet the requirements that procedures must not be ""prohibitively expensive"". We note the following general features in these other jurisdictions.
18. Most of the other jurisdictions we examined have a `loser pays' principle that would apply in environmental public law proceedings. But in most cases this is tempered by a number of factors. In particular: (1) It is more usual for the court to decide that the parties are to bear their own costs in public law proceedings - this being the general rule rather than the exception (France, Italy).
(2) In all jurisdictions examined, the costs payable are capped by a professional body/statutory scale and, in comparison to the UK, such costs are usually very limited (i.e. in the low thousands of euros).
18 The others were Hungary, Austria, Germany and Malta, with questions of legal standing rather than costs being the key obstacle in the last three. 19 The selection was based on the jurisdictions in which the Working Group had ready access to lawyers. We are grateful to James Kennedy and colleagues in European offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer who provided us with information.

11
The implications of Aarhus for access to environmental justice

(3) There is no formal equivalent to the Bolton guidelines (see para 24(2) below) in the jurisdictions examined and therefore, in theory, a claimant could be liable for the costs of both a defendant public authority and an interested party. But in practice a similar approach to that contained in the Bolton guidelines is applied, and claimants are rarely required to pay an interested party's costs. (4) In some of the jurisdictions examined, natural persons challenging public law decisions can be ordered to pay costs only in exceptional circumstances (the Netherlands, Spain). (5) Although in all the other jurisdictions we examined an injunction would be available to a claimant in a public law environmental case, as a general rule no cross-undertaking in respect of damages or surety would be required to obtain it. Such a concept is unknown in France, Germany, Hungary and the Netherlands (although it would be open to the interested party to sue for damages if it considered the injunction obtained by the claimant had given rise to damages to the interested party). Furthermore, although in Italy and Spain it is possible to seek `surety' from a claimant as the price for obtaining an injunction, in Italy this does not apply to environmental and public health cases, and in Spain such an order would be the exception rather than the rule.
19. Our investigation is thus consistent with that undertaken for the EC in showing that as a general matter the costs rules in the other jurisdictions examined do not present a significant barrier to access to justice in environmental public law cases because: (i) as a general rule it is much less likely that a claimant would be ordered to pay the costs of a defendant public authority and/or an interested party; and (ii) the consequences of bearing that reduced risk are less because the likely costs, if payable, are significantly lower in most cases, often by several orders of magnitude.

20. In assessing the adequacy of current procedures in England and Wales, and suggesting means of addressing the Aarhus obligations, we have considered a number of general implications of the Aarhus requirements concerning access to justice.
(1) Aarhus does not require members of the public to be entitled to bring manifestly bad challenges ­ the requirement for an arguable case and thus JR permission remains legitimate. (2) We agree with the view of the Court of Appeal in Burkett that the ""not prohibitively expensive"" obligation arising under the Convention is not limited the court fees involved,20 but is to be seen in relation to the actual costs of funding and more particularly the cost implications of losing an environmental judicial review challenge. The costs involved are the total costs associated with bringing the claim in question, including the claimant's liability to their own lawyers (as well as under a Conditional Fee Arrangement (CFA)) and, should the case fail, to other parties. (3) Aarhus expressly preserves the power of national courts to award `reasonable' costs in judicial proceedings.21 We consider that what is reasonable must be judged in the light of the overall requirement that procedures are ""not prohibitively expensive"".22
20 We note that the government's published summary of implementing measures refers only to the court fees: ""Court fees are reasonable. Certain applicants will be exempted from court fees, others will have court fees remitted on grounds of hardship, or will receive public funding"" op.cit. footnote 17. However, the most recent government Implementation Report on Aarhus (January 2008) now also refers to costs, and the discretion available to the courts to depart from the normal costs in the cause rule: www.defra.gov. uk/environment/internat/aarhus/pdf/aarhus-convention-implementation-report.pdf 21 Article 3(8). 22 In Sweetman v An Bord Pleanala and the Attorney General [2007] IEHC 153 the Irish High Court considered Aarhus provisions as they related to costs awards. To the extent that the judgment of Clarke J implies that Article 9(4) relates only to court fees, we respectfully disagree with the interpretation.


(4) We consider that the requirement for procedures not to be prohibitively expensive applies to all proceedings, including applications for injunctive relief and not merely the overall application for final relief in the proceedings. (5) As both the preamble to Aarhus and Article 9(5) recognise, citizens may need assistance in order to exercise their rights of access to justice in environmental matters (which we consider can come from mechanisms such as legal aid or from ensuring that, for example, the costs regimes allow claimants to engage lawyers, say through CFAs). (6) Overall, we consider that such costs, whether actual or risked, would be ""prohibitively expensive"" if they would reasonably prevent an `ordinary' member of the public23 from embarking on the challenge falling within the terms of Aarhus. (7) It unavoidably follows that the successful defendant in such a case (or, for that matter, the successful interested party developer) is unlikely to recover more than a small fraction of the costs it has incurred in resisting a claim to which Aarhus applies and which has been given JR permission.

22. We suggest a number of recommendations below that could be fairly swiftly and easily introduced initially by the judiciary under their discretionary powers and later incorporated into a Practice Direction and/or the Civil Procedure Rules. We feel these would go a long way to meeting our concerns about compliance with Aarhus on access to environmental justice. We have considered the sorts of numbers of cases that might be involved, and recognise that there will concerns that compliance with Aarhus might give rise to a large number of new environmental judicial reviews that have been inhibited by current costs procedures. But, for the reasons discussed in paras 101-107 below, we feel that the `floodgates' argument is likely to be unfounded.

21. Public bodies that successfully defend their environmental decisions are unable to recover costs against legally aided defendants (see discussion at para 30 below). We recognise that, to the extent that compliance with Aarhus and our recommendations may imply some increase in the cost of defending decisions taken by public bodies, some additional funding from charge-payers or the public purse will be required.

23 That elusive concept of a member of a public who is neither very rich nor very poor, and would not be entitled to legal aid ­ see the figures at footnote 33 below.

13
Current barriers to access to environmental justice

5 Current barriers to access to environmental justice
23. We thus turn to the particular issues that have been identified as providing obstacles to the achievement of access to environmental justice in England and Wales.
24. In the context of concern about costs, we note the following general features of the judicial review regime, including those as conventionally applied to environmental judicial reviews: (1) The general rule is that the loser pays the winner's costs (CPR Part 43). In environmental judicial review this generally means that a person or organisation that brings the challenge will pay the public authority's costs of defending the challenge if they lose ­ unless the claim is brought with the benefit of legal aid or a Protective Costs Order (PCO) or another similar costs order/agreement is in place. (2) The challenger is also potentially exposed to the costs incurred by interested parties, such as the beneficiary of the consent which is under challenge. Whether or not they will eventually be liable will be informed by what the House of Lords said in Bolton24, but unless that evaluation is done at the outset of the proceedings (say as part of a PCO), the challenger remains exposed to what is likely to be a low, but not an insignificant, risk of paying what could be very substantial25 costs. Such liabilities can also arise at the permission stage and may be a significant deterrent even to the commencement of a challenge.26

(3) Where a claimant has been held liable for the costs incurred by a defendant or developer, the court will consider whether the costs claimed were ""proportionate to the matters in issue""27 and (assuming the ""standard basis"") ""proportionately and reasonably incurred""28 and ""proportionate and reasonable in amount"".29 Those principles do not, of course, expressly reflect the requirement by Article 9(3) that costs should not be ""prohibitively expensive"". (4) If an appropriate PCO is made at or near the outset of proceedings then those impacts can be mitigated but, as considered in paras 41-49 below, very few such orders have actually been made, and the current principles concerning PCOs have not been developed with Aarhus in mind. Moreover the nature of the particular PCO involved is critical to whether it actually leads to access to environmental justice. (5) The solution may be somewhat different for an NGO bringing a challenge (and indeed different for differently resourced NGOs) in comparison with the position of an individual or local group. For example, an agreement made at the outset of litigation that each party will pay its own costs or a PCO to that effect may be entirely satisfactory for a large NGO that can meet its own costs but will be of little benefit to an individual, local group or specialist NGO that can only secure legal support through, say, a Conditional Fee Agreement (which, in turn, relies on the possibility of a positive costs order in the event of success).

24 Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v Secretary of State for the Environment: Same v Same (No. 2) (1995) LTL 25/5/95. 25 For example, in R (on the application of Friends of the Earth) v Environment Agency (2003), the interested third party, the developer, served Friends of the Earth with a Schedule of Costs for slightly over £100,000 for a one-day judicial review hearing on a preliminary issue, on which the company chose to instruct leading Counsel and two junior barristers. 26 Recent examples include a claim by a developer (beneficiary of a challenged consent) for £31,000 for preparing an Acknowledgment of Service and £36,000 for resisting an application for interim injunction.



(6) Nor can there be any significant reliance on lawyers, whether solicitors or barristers, agreeing to undertake such work at significantly reduced, let alone zero, rates. There are relatively few expert practitioners in this area of law,30 where expertise is essential, particularly those willing to act for claimants. As Brooke LJ noted at paragraph 76 of Burkett, maintaining the viability of their practices is an important aspect of ensuring access to environmental justice. Nor does the existing level of `pro bono' support from practitioners in other practice areas, while laudable in itself, provide a consistent or long-term solution to this problem. (7) The position is likely to be very different where the claimant is eligible for and supported by legal aid (i.e. funding from the Community Legal Service provided by the Legal Services Commission (LSC)). However, eligibility for legal aid is severely restricted and brings with it particular difficulties which we consider further below at paras 27-35. (8) In many instances the claimant's legal team will be acting on a basis that relies (if not in the individual case then certainly in cases overall) on a costs order being made in favour of the challenger where the challenge is successful. The complexity and uncertainty of environmental litigation makes it particularly difficult under the existing costs jurisdiction to be confident of full costs recovery even if a challenge is successful in substance.

(9) A further critical `costs' issue for many environmental judicial reviews is the general requirement that an interim injunction is only available to a claimant who provides a cross-undertaking in damages.31 This is relevant because, in many environmental cases, the consent being challenged allows the beneficiary of the consent to undertake some irreversible or significantly damaging process ­ for example, destroying the natural habitat or species that the challenge seeks to protect. Unless prevented from doing so until the judicial review is completed, success in the judicial review can be entirely academic.32 Being able to obtain an injunction (or, alternatively, access to court procedures so speedy that the case can be determined before the damaging process is commenced) is key to that. Indeed Aarhus specifically recognises the need for procedures to be ""timely"". In this context, however, it is rare that a challenger, whether an individual or group, could bear the risk of giving a cross-undertaking in damages. We consider this issue further at paras 73-84 below. (10) A claimant may succeed (or substantially succeed) in the underlying issues of the claim but nonetheless `fail' because discretionary relief is withheld with costs being awarded against the claimant. This uncertainty presents a further potential barrier to access to justice in environmental law cases. The discretionary withholding of relief may be appropriate where it has taken a long time to determine the claim and things have materially moved on. But the cost consequences that may follow under current practice, often through no fault of the claimant, can prejudice the requirement for `effective' remedies as well as creating uncertainty of outcome.

30 A paper presented by Professor John Bonine of Oregon University to the 2nd annual meeting of the UNECE Aarhus Convention Task Force on Access to Justice in September 2007 reported that there are in the region of 20 practising public interest environmental lawyers in England and Wales, in contrast to some 500 in the US.

31 A commitment on the part of the claimant, in the event of losing the case, to reimburse any loss sustained or cost incurred by the defendant and/or an interested party as a result of prohibiting work on the project in question until the substantive hearing has been concluded. 32 See thus, for example, the decision in Lappel Bank in which, by the time the RSPB's challenge to the legality of a planning permission had been upheld, the development had taken place, in the absence of an injunction (a cross-undertaking in damages having been insisted upon as a precondition to an injunction) and the protected habitat had been destroyed: R v Secretary of State for the Environment ex parte the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds [1997] Env L.R. 431.

15
Legal aid and public funding

25. Our overall view is that the key issue limiting access to environmental justice and inhibiting compliance with Article 9(4) of Aarhus is that of costs and the potential exposure to costs. What is notable about the problem is that, by and large, it flows from the application of ordinary costs principles of private law to judicial review and, within that, of ordinary principles of judicial review to environmental judicial review. We consider that the first of those does not take proper account of the particular features of public law. And that the latter is only acceptable in so far as it maintains compliance with Aarhus.
26. In that context, and despite the views of the Master of the Rolls in the same case, we have sympathy with Sedley LJ's observations in Davey v Aylesbury Vale District Council [2007] EWCA Civ 1166, when considering costs issues arising from a judicial review challenge to a planning permission:
""Planning cases tend ... to lie on or near the boundary between private or commercial judicial review and public interest litigation. Many, including the present one, straddle it: they are brought by a personally interested individual, typically a neighbouring landowner or occupier, but raise issues of local or general environmental concern. Insofar as they do so, it is right to bear in mind what this court said in R (Corner House Research) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2005] EWCA Civ 192, 1 WLR 2600, §69-70:

27. Both the preambles to Aarhus and Article 9(5) expressly recognise that members of the public may need assistance in order to secure their rights of access to environmental justice. The Civil Legal Aid Scheme, namely public funding as part of the Community Legal Service under the Access to Justice Act 1999, is clearly critical in that regard and will remain of vital importance to securing access to justice in many environmental cases. The availability of public funding is capable of ensuring compliance with Article 9(4) for those people and in those cases to which it applies.
28. However, the Community Legal Service, like any legal aid scheme, is not unrestricted and has limitations in terms of financial eligibility, merits criteria and scope (including being restricted to supporting individuals rather than bodies such as NGOs).33 It is therefore important that legal aid is not seen as, and does not become, `the only game in town' for environmental litigation and ensuring compliance with Aarhus. Proper and effective access to justice is likely to require a range of funding options.

""We are satisfied that there are features of public law litigation which distinguish it from private law civil and family litigation ... The important difference here is that there is a public interest in the elucidation of public law by the higher courts in addition to the interests of the individual parties. One should not therefore necessarily expect identical principles to govern the incidence of costs in public law cases ...""

33 In this context we note the current eligibility limits for legal representation in judicial reviews. Applicants with a gross income of £2,435 or more a month are not eligible for funding, nor will an applicant with disposable income exceeding £672 a month receive any funding, and with contributions payable where disposable income is between £290 and £672 a month. A claimant's disposable capital must not exceed £8,000, including the claimant's main dwelling but with an equity disregard of £100,000 (source Legal Services Commission). According to government national statistics, the average (median) disposable income in the UK for 2004-05 was £1,699 a month (Hansard 29 June 2006), though the figures are not directly comparable because of different calculations for `disposable'. The mix adjusted average house price in August 2007 England and Wales in 2007 was £226,902 (source: Dept of Communities and Local Government, October 2007).


29. Features of the modern legal aid scheme were described at paragraphs 21 to 40 of the Working Group chaired by Maurice Kay LJ34 in relation to protective costs orders and need not be repeated here. Legal aid remuneration issues are discussed in the context of costs orders generally. But it is worth drawing attention to three features of legal aid that are of particular significance to environmental cases: costs protection, public interest and alternative funding.
Costs protection 30. This is the statutory protection that legally aided clients have always enjoyed against liability to pay other side costs ordered against them. Section 11 of the 1999 Act and related regulations ensure that a legally aided party is liable to pay any costs order only to the extent that it is reasonable in all the circumstances including his or her financial situation. For practical purposes, bearing in mind the limited means which legal aid clients inevitably have, it is very rare for clients to be required to make any payment in relation to inter partes costs under these rules. Hence section 11 gives something close to complete protection from costs. Insofar as the general high level of costs ordered against unsuccessful parties is seen as an undue deterrent that inhibits the access to justice required by Aarhus, legal aid appears to be a partial solution. However, because legal aid cannot cover all cases, inter partes orders remain a major deterrent under all other funding models.

Public interest 31. Taking account of the wider public interest is an innovation under the LSC's Funding Code introduced from April 2000. Traditionally, legal aid entitlement was based on the private client test under which only the benefits of the case to the claimant were strictly relevant in justifying the likely costs. Wider public interest is now defined in the Funding Code to mean: ""the potential of the proceedings to produce real benefits for individuals other than the client (other than benefits to the public at large which normally flow from proceedings of the type in question)"".35
32. This definition allows for a wide approach to recognition of benefits. The LSC has had no difficulty in acknowledging cases with environmental benefits as falling within this test, as illustrated by the reports of the LSC's Public Interest Advisory Panel which has a specific category for environmental cases.36 Under the Funding Code where a case is considered to have a significant wider public interest, it has a lower merits threshold, requiring only `borderline' prospects of success rather than a strict 50% merit threshold. And further, any wider benefits to the environment and others can be taken into account in a more discretionary costs benefit test than applies to other funded cases. This flexible approach to public interest greatly assists in meeting the Aarhus obligations.

35 Legal Services Commission Funding Code Criteria, section 2.4. 36 See the Public Interest Report section of the LSC's website: www.legalservices.gov.uk

17
The `loser pays' principle

Alternative funding 33. This is a general legal aid criterion under which the LSC can require any persons or bodies who might benefit from the outcome of funded proceedings to make a contribution towards the costs. The LSC's current guidance on this criterion is attached to this report as Appendix 2. This regime is of particular importance in environmental cases since there will often be a wider community that benefits from the challenge and a `community contribution' is thus common. Issues arise as to how it should be calculated (and they are currently the subject of debate with, and we imagine within, the LSC). In our experience, detailed discussions take place on a case by case basis, with the LSC expecting evidence on a range of matters that affect how the contribution is to be calculated. But the key point is that, even where a claimant brings an environmental JR with the benefit of legal aid, there is very likely to have been a significant financial contribution from others and considerable discussion between the claimant's solicitors and the LSC about the principle of, and basis for, funding.
34. Legal aid is only one of a number of possible funding options for environmental cases, and it is important that those options should not be seen as mutually exclusive. For example, the LSC's Guidance recognises that various combinations of funding may be possible within an individual case such as a partnership approach between legal aid and NGOs in supporting an important case. To date these partnerships have not been developed. We would encourage the LSC to develop that approach in cooperation with non-governmental organisations and other interested bodies in future environmental litigation.
35. Until recently,  itself has not been referred to the LSC's Funding Code or Guidance. But we welcome the fact that this year express references to  have been included in the LSC material. The current LSC guidance on alternative funding is contained within Appendix 2.

7 The `loser pays' principle
36. As we have indicated, one of the core implications of Aarhus is that the costs, whether actual or risked, would be ""prohibitively expensive"" if they would prevent a member of the public or non-governmental organisation who would not be eligible for legal aid from embarking on the challenge in question. We consider it to be plain that any costs order made in proceedings to which Aarhus applies needs to secure compliance with Aarhus.
37. We have considered whether, as some have suggested, it would be appropriate for cases of any particular type to be exempted altogether from the `loser pays' costs rule. Such a rule could, of course, always be qualified by the fact that a claimant who behaved unreasonably or vexatiously in the conduct of the litigation would nonetheless be at risk of an adverse costs order. Such a rule would essentially put the defendant and any interested third party in the same position they face when challenged by a legally-aided claimant with no realistic prospect of recovering their costs even if they succeed, at least in the High Court.
38. However, we have concluded that such an approach is neither appropriate nor necessary ­ and is not, in our view, required by Aarhus ­ provided that the loser's potential liability does not make litigation prohibitively expensive in the way described above. Indeed, we consider that the requirement that a claimant be exposed to some costs risk promotes a number of objectives. It provides an important discipline against frivolous claims being brought and ensures a degree of engagement and commitment with the challenge which has an important place as part of the democratic structures within which Aarhus operates ­ much as does the `community contribution' that the LSC sometimes requires in order to support an individual claimant.37 But this view is premised on what we consider to be the required approach to ""prohibitive expense"".
Protective costs orders

39. That said, since uncertainty as to the eventual costs liability will be in itself part of the barrier to access to environmental justice, we consider that early resolution of costs issues is of particular importance.
40. We thus turn to consider some of the mechanisms that have been identified for early resolution of costs questions for claimants not eligible for legal aid, whether individuals or organisations.

8 Protective costs orders
Current principles
41. A protective costs order (PCO) is an order of the court by which it specifies or constrains at an early stage what the costs outcome of the case will be (usually depending on the merits outcome). Thus, the court can specify what costs and up to what limit each party will have to pay. A PCO can therefore provide early certainty on the limits of a claimant's costs liability and, by controlling the level involved, ensure that costs exposure will not be prohibitively expensive, in line with Aarhus.

42. The natural starting point for any discussion about PCOs is the judgment in Corner House38 in which the Court of Appeal built on previous judicial thinking to develop some principles that have, in practice, been applied as principles of general application.

43. The relevant passage of the judgment in the Court of Appeal is as follows: ""Dyson J [in CPAG] emphasised that the guidelines related to public interest challenges, which he defined at p 353. We believe that this definition can usefully be incorporated into the guidelines themselves. Dyson J said that the jurisdiction to make a PCO should be exercised only in the most exceptional circumstances. We agree with this statement, but of itself it does not assist in identifying those circumstances.

38 R (Corner House Research) v Secretary of State for Trade & Industry [2005] 1 W.L.R. 2600.

19
Protective costs orders

""We endorse the first, third and fourth of the CPAG guidelines. We consider, however, that the second guideline needs to be recast. It commonly happens when a court has to take an important decision at an early stage of proceedings that it must do no more than conclude that the applicant's case has a real (as opposed to a fanciful) prospect of success, or that its case is ""properly arguable"". To place the threshold any higher is to invite heavy and time-consuming ancillary litigation of the type that disfigured the conduct of civil litigation 25 years ago. We realise that in CPR Part 54 the rule-maker prescribed no explicit criterion for the grant of permission to apply for judicial review, but we consider that no PCO should be granted unless the judge considers that the application for judicial review has a real prospect of success and that it is in the public interest to make the order.
""We would therefore restate the governing principles in these terms:
""1. A protective costs order may be made at any stage of the proceedings, on such conditions as the court thinks fit, provided that the court is satisfied that:
i) The issues raised are of general public importance;
ii) The public interest requires that those issues should be resolved;
iii) The claimant has no private interest in the outcome of the case;
iv) Having regard to the financial resources of the claimant and the respondent(s) and to the amount of costs that are likely to be involved it is fair and just to make the order;
v) If the order is not made the claimant will probably discontinue the proceedings and will be acting reasonably in so doing.
""2. If those acting for the claimant are doing so pro bono this will be likely to enhance the merits of the application for a PCO.

The Court of Appeal went on to make the following statement regarding the corresponding impact of a PCO on the claimant's costs: ""(i) When making any PCO where the applicant is seeking an order for costs in its favour if it wins, the court should prescribe by way of a capping order a total amount of the recoverable costs which will be inclusive, so far as a CFA-funded party is concerned, of any additional liability; (ii) The purpose of the PCO will be to limit or extinguish the liability of the applicant if it loses, and as a balancing factor the liability of the defendant for the applicant's costs if the defendant loses will thus be restricted to a reasonably modest amount. The applicant should expect the capping order to restrict it to solicitors' fees and a fee for a single advocate of junior counsel status that are no more than modest. iii) The overriding purpose of exercising this jurisdiction is to enable the applicant to present its case to the court with a reasonably competent advocate without being exposed to such serious financial risks that would deter it from advancing a case of general public importance at all, where the court considers that it is in the public interest that an order should be made. The beneficiary of a PCO must not expect the capping order that will accompany the PCO to permit anything other than modest representation, and must arrange its legal representation (when its lawyers are not willing to act pro bono) accordingly.""
Inconsistency of current principles with Aarhus
44. Appendix 3 of this report elaborates a number of issues that have arisen in practice in the application of the Corner House principles to PCOs. These indicate the extent to which the existing principles do not appear to be consistent with the Aarhus requirement that procedures are not prohibitively expensive.

""3. It is for the court, in its discretion, to decide whether it is fair and just to make the order in the light of the considerations set out above.""



45. Two core conditions under Corner House stand out in this context. First, that the issues raised must be of ""general public importance"". Many environmental challenges would not cross this threshold, where it is interpreted as meaning that a case must decide a new point of law, or be of widescale importance or affect people over a very wide area (in a recent case, the affected population was that of West Hertfordshire ­ some 500,000 people ­ and yet the Court of Appeal decided there was no ""general public importance"").
46. The Aarhus obligation to ensure that procedures are not prohibitively expensive is not limited to any particular category of cases such as those of ""general public importance"". Indeed, the upholding of environmental law is itself considered to be a matter of ""general public importance"", hence the need for its protection under Aarhus generally and Art. 9 specifically. The recitals to the Convention make the point crisply:
""... Recognising also that every person has the right to live in an environment adequate to his or her health and well-being, and the duty, both individually and in association with others, to protect and improve the environment for the benefit of present and future generations,
""Considering that, to be able to assert this right and observe this duty, citizens must have access to information, be entitled to participate in decision-making and have access to justice in environmental matters, and acknowledging in this regard that citizens may need assistance in order to exercise their rights.""39

47. The second core requirement of Corner House that the claimant must have ""no private interest"" has been subject to criticism both judicially40 and extra-judicially.41 In the context of environmental judicial reviews, the requirement is particularly ill-suited to the underlying public policy context for the following reasons: (1) An application for judicial review that is brought for the purposes of protecting the environment is inherently a matter of public interest; (2) Standing requirements mean that a person who is not an NGO and is proposing to bring a judicial review may well have some form of private interest as a result, say, of living close to a development; (3) There are a range of private interests involved (amenity, financial, property owning) each of which engage wholly different public policy considerations in this context. We consider that the possibility that the person proposing to bring the judicial review may have a private (pecuniary) interest is a factor to be taken into account in considering the position in respect of the respective financial positions of the parties and may well contribute to the level at which the PCO would be set in the circumstances of the case.
48. Again, we note that the Aarhus requirements contain no exclusion on cases involving private interests. If that condition were to remain, PCOs could not play a significant role in ensuring Aarhus compliance.


40 Wilkinson v Kitzinger and Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor [2006] EWHC 2022. 41 Litigating the Public Interest: Report of the Working Group on Facilitating Public Interest Litigation (2006) (paras 77-86) op. cit. footnote 6.


49. Questions of costs are, axiomatically, matters of judicial discretion, and that is particularly the case in a PCO context. However, we consider that the discretion should in future be exercised in accordance with principles that explicitly recognise the requirements of Aarhus.42
The need for PCOs that are compliant with Aarhus
50. In the light of these concerns and the issues elaborated in Appendix 3 of this report, one approach would be to express the hope that the Court of Appeal would find an early opportunity to reformulate the Corner House principles to meet the general concerns emerging from their application, and in respect of environmental cases in particular. This would have wider implications for public law beyond the remit of this Group. Given that the current PCO principles were not developed with Aarhus in mind and clearly contain constraints that are not consistent with the Convention, we recommend the preferable solution would be to adopt a bespoke approach to PCOs in environmental cases to which Aarhus applies.

51. It would follow that in a case falling within the terms of Aarhus43 and where a PCO is sought, the overarching requirement must be for a PCO that secures compliance with Aarhus. Conditions relating to the requirement of general public importance and no private interest that might still be applicable to PCOs in other types of cases but which are inconsistent with Aarhus would not apply. If the individual Aarhus claimant, acting reasonably in the circumstances, would be prohibited by the level of costs or cost risks from bringing the case, then the court must make some form of PCO to ensure compliance.44 This echoes the fifth limb of the Corner House test ­ ""if the order is not made the claimant will probably discontinue the proceedings and will be acting reasonably in so doing"".
52. Aarhus grants rights to individuals and nongovernmental organisations to access to justice. In that context, we do not think it would be consistent with Aarhus for a court to refuse a PCO to a particular claimant on the grounds that there was another more wealthy prospective claimant who might be able to pursue a similar claim without a PCO.

42 We note that in R (Greenpeace) v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [2007] EWHC 311 (Admin) para. 49, the court observed that in the environmental field general public law principles concerning consultation had now to be considered in the light of Aarhus: ""Whatever the position may be in other policy areas, in the development of policy in the environmental field consultation is no longer a privilege to be granted or withheld at will by the executive."" The same approach by analogy would apply to conventional principles concerning costs.

43 This would be a matter for judicial determination. For a case falling within Art 9(2) (challenges to consents for specified activities) or the EC Directives on Environmental Assessment or Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control, the question should be generally straightforward. For cases falling with Art 9(3), we recognise that there may be sometimes arguments as to whether it involves a contravention of a ""national law relating to the environment"", but again in the final analysis this would fall for judicial decision. 44 We have noted that there is an interpretation of Aarhus that suggests the test of whether procedures are ""prohibitively expensive"" is objective rather than subjective ­ i.e. the question is whether a case is prohibitively expensive in general terms or to a person of average means rather than to the individual claimant. However, because of the very low current eligibility levels for legal aid (see footnote 33 above), in practice there is unlikely to much difference between a subjective or objective interpretation.



53. In the case of a non-governmental organisation promoting environmental protection, any decision whether the expense would be prohibitive must recognise that there are many calls on the funds of the organisation. An approach that was likely to prevent the NGO bringing the claim (for example, because it required such an organisation to reduce other areas of its work in order to incur risk of such liability) would not only be inconsistent with Art. 9 of  but also with Art. 3(4)45 which requires parties to provide support and recognition to such organisations ""and to ensure that its national legal system is consistent with this obligation"". 54. In summary, the award of a PCO would be subject to three conditions ­ (a) the case is one that falls within Aarhus; (b) permission is granted; and (c) the costs and risk of exposure to costs would be prohibitively expensive to the claimant. Appendix 4 of this report elaborates on the features that we suggest would be appropriate to apply to a PCO regime that is consistent with Aarhus.
45 Article 3 (4): Each Party shall provide for appropriate recognition of and support to associations, organisations or groups promoting environmental protection and ensure that its national legal system is consistent with this obligation.

55. We note, of course, that any claimant must still satisfy the court that they have an arguable case46 so as to secure permission for judicial review ­ Aarhus is not intended to facilitate the wholly unmeritorious challenge. But it is important to stress that the Aarhus requirements that procedures are not prohibitively expensive are not confined only to cases once they have been granted permission, but will equally apply to the claimant while establishing whether a case does have merit. The Court of Appeal's advice that costs at the permission stage should be proportionate needs to be particularly followed in the case of Aarhus claims, and costs at that stage should generally be set at a very modest level.
46 As to which, see what the Court of Appeal said in Davey: ""It may be helpful first to recall what Lord Diplock said in the National Federation of the Self-Employed case [1982] AC 617, 643-4: ""... The whole purpose of requiring that leave should first be obtained to make the application for judicial review would be defeated if the court were to go into the matter in any depth at that stage. If, on a quick perusal of the material then available, the court thinks that it discloses what might on further consideration turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting to the applicant the relief claimed, it ought, in the exercise of a judicial discretion, to give him leave to apply for that relief. "" In the same vein, Lord Woolf in his 1989 Hamlyn Lectures, Protection of the Public ­ a New Challenge, noted that the Justice All Souls Review had argued for the abolition of the leave requirement but said (p.21): ""In practice the requirement, far from being an impediment to the individual litigant, can even be to his advantage since it enables a litigant expeditiously and cheaply to obtain the view of a High Court judge on the merits of his application."" We have been shown in the course of argument the transcript of a permission application in the Administrative Court [2007] EWHC 2352 (Admin) in the course of which Burton J expressed a preference for the maximum amount of material on a contest at the permission stage. While there may be cases in which it is necessary or helpful to explore issues in depth at this stage, such cases must be quite exceptional. The proper place for a full exploration of evidence and argument is at the hearing of a claim which has been shown at the permission stage to be arguable. It follows that it ought not ordinarily to be necessary for a public body on which a claim for judicial review is served to do much additional work before completing its acknowledgment of service. In the nature of things it should already know what it has done and why. If on inspection it realises that it has slipped up, it may well not oppose the application. For the rest, its proper course is to explain its decision and any further grounds of opposition in short form and wait to see if, with or without a contested court hearing, permission is granted to challenge it.


9 Limited liability companies as claimants

10 Costs awards against defendants

56. As an alternative to seeking a PCO, groups of claimants have sometimes formed a limited liability company as a vehicle for litigation. The logic of the approach is simple. For example, residents of an area affected by a proposed development may wish to challenge a planning permission, and would generally need to identify a small number of individuals to act as claimants, with those claimants then being fully exposed to the costs of losing. Instead, by pursuing their challenge through a company created for the purpose, such persons can channel and limit liability for costs through a single entity.
57. It is now clear that such a company has the same standing in relation to the challenge that its members (e.g. the residents) would have and that it is not necessarily an abuse of the court process for a claim to be brought in that way. Any concern about the fact that costs liability would, all other things being equal, be no more than the value (often nominal) of the company can be dealt with through agreement about, or an order for, security for costs.47
58. As far as we are aware, the level of security for costs in such cases has been based on conventional costs principles and not by reference to the requirements of Aarhus. We recommend that where a limited company is the claimant in a case to which Aarhus applies, judicial consideration is given to the level at which security for costs is set so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Convention. Provided this is done, we see no fundamental difficulty with that approach.

59. Compliance with Aarhus, however, is unlikely to be achieved simply by limiting the exposure of the claimant to the other parties' costs. That is because the cost of funding their own legal team (and in a legal context where litigation `in person' is rarely realistic) on a conventional commercial basis would undoubtedly be prohibitively expensive for an ordinary member of the public.
Legally-aided cases
60. Aarhus recognises that members of the public may require support to secure access to environmental justice and that is provided by legal aid where that is available. But, even in a legally-aided case, claimants need to recover costs when their case succeeds. That is because for many years there has been a substantial gulf between costs recoverable between the parties in successful cases (i.e. at the normal inter partes rates allowed by the court) and the costs payable from the Legal Aid Fund if the case is lost (i.e. at rates prescribed by regulation or contract). This may be even more pronounced in `high cost cases'48 as called by the Legal Services Commission, for which even more restrictive `risk rates'49 are applied under individual case contracts, which ensure that the risk of losing the case is shared between the claimant's legal team and the taxpayer.

47 Residents against Waste Ltd v Lancashire County Council [2007] EWHC 2558; R v Leicestershire County Council ex parte Blackfordby and Boothorpe Action Group Ltd [2001] Env LR 35.

48 Generally those where claimant costs are likely to exceed £25,000. 49 The basic risk rate is £70 per hour for solicitors, £50 for junior counsel and £90 for senior counsel. The LSC can increase the rate by 30% in cases with only borderline prospects of success which are being funded on grounds of significant wider public interest, overwhelming importance to the client, or significant human rights issues.



61. That differential between legal aid and `inter partes' rates,50 which creates a powerful disincentive against claimants (and their lawyers) running weak cases, is likely to remain a feature of the Legal Aid Scheme for the foreseeable future. It also means that, if claimants do not recover their costs on a full basis when their environmental judicial review is successful, or substantially successful, that will severely prejudice the ability of the lawyers in question to undertake the cases and thus compliance overall with Aarhus51.
62. The general `rule' is that costs `follow the event' (i.e. the loser pays the winner's costs52), such that a successful environmental challenger should generally recover their costs. However, the recognised exceptions to that `rule' have a particular significance here. For example, if costs are awarded on an issues-based approach, that can have a dramatic effect for the claimant's lawyers, particularly in a high cost case. That is because the LSC will generally force them to choose either to be paid for the fraction being covered by the `inter partes' order, or to be paid by the LSC for the other fraction. Thus, for example, if a 50% order is made, the claimant's lawyers will be paid 50% of their normal rates at most53 such that it is those lawyers who, in the end, directly take the `hit' as a result of the order.
Non legally-aided cases
63. Where legal aid is not available (including, for example, for NGOs wishing to bring challenges) other funding approaches have been developed by claimants and their lawyers. In that context, increasingly litigation is funded under arrangements (as between the claimant and their lawyers) which depend, at least in part, on the recovery of costs from the defendant if the claim succeeds.
50 The ""indemnity principle"" (which means that a successful party can normally only recover from the losing party the costs for which it would have been liable to its own lawyers) does not apply to a legally-aided claimant. 51 See also the discussion in Scott Baker J's judgment in Boxall v Waltham Forest 21 December 2000. 52 CPR 44.3(2). 53 In contrast to the position in ordinary, privately-funded litigation, where a 50% order would mean that the lawyers were paid 50% by the other side and 50% by their client.

64. This is most clearly true for actions supported under a CFA where remuneration is entirely dependant on costs recovery. In that context it is important to note that the CFA mechanism was put in place by statute precisely to improve access to justice across the board and so should not be undermined by the practice of costs orders, particularly so as to prejudice Aarhus compliance.
65. It is also important to note that CFAs are seldom used on their own in environmental challenges (because the claimant cannot take the risk of having to meet an adverse costs order if they lose54). In part this is because `after the event' insurance is unlikely to be available. But even if this can be overcome (say by a PCO), costs uncertainty will still be a major deterrent for the legal team.
Uncertainty of costs orders
66. It is not only `split' costs orders that cause problems as above. The discretionary nature of public law remedies adds to the uncertainty which further prejudices the ability and willingness of claimant lawyers to take on cases.
67. A good example is where the court decides that there has been an illegality, but the public authority (or the beneficiary of the consent) persuades the court to withhold substantive relief such as an order quashing the decision or consent under challenge.55 In that situation the court conventionally treats the claimant as having lost for the purposes of costs.
54 Occasionally, environmental challengers decide to take the risk because they have ""nothing to lose"", but that cannot be an answer in Aarhus terms. 55 Such withholding of relief may occur where, say, because of the time it has taken to hear the case, the relief in question has become academic, or where it would be grossly disproportionate to quash the permit given the wider impact that would have.


68. That is particularly problematic where the claimant was seeking to establish a point of wider environmental importance and so cannot be truly said to have substantively `lost'. This matters when it comes to access to environmental justice and compliance with Aarhus because even claimants with a strong argument cannot be confident of being awarded their costs and/or not having an award made against them because of the huge uncertainty around the relief.56
69. To date, the courts have not fully appreciated those matters and so have not been greatly swayed by arguments about remuneration when exercising discretion on costs payable between parties. Indeed, in the Burkett case, Brooke LJ said the following:

71. We recommend that (whether the case is legally aided or the claimant proceeds on a CFA or other similar basis):57
(1) Where a claimant has been substantially successful in their environmental challenge (such as where the court has concluded that the decision was unlawful) but the court has then withheld relief on purely discretionary grounds (i.e. the claimant has substantially won), the claimant should be treated as having `won' for the purposes of the general costs rule that the loser pays the winner's cost; and (2) Where the claimant has `won' (actually or substantially) the general position (i.e. that the loser pays the winner's costs, including any CFA uplift) should prevail.

""71. We are, of course, troubled by the submissions we received to the effect that a judgment along the present lines may deter those solicitors and members of the Bar who would otherwise be willing to act for LSC funded clients. There can be no doubt that the present scarcity of public funding of such clients is inimical to the future potential of what used to be known as The Legal Aid Scheme, but issues relating to public funding are for others to take. Our task is to interpret the present statutory scheme as we find it.""

72. It is less clear whether such an approach should be applicable where cases settle before trial. There is an inherent problem with funding mechanisms that depend on between the parties costs recovery in that they tend to inhibit early settlement, although in legal aid cases there is a statutory objective to resolve cases without contested court proceedings.

70. We believe it is now necessary for the court to take a different approach to recovery of costs between the parties in environmental cases to which Aarhus applies, so as to ensure compliance with its requirements.




11 Injunctions and other remedies
73. The issue of costs and costs exposure also arises where a claimant seeks an injunction to prevent irreversible or significant environmental impact with which their challenge is concerned taking place until the merits of their challenge have been determined. A claimant in judicial review proceedings can apply for interim relief under Part 54.3(1) of the CPR. But a significant problem associated with interim injunctions is that the court may, and usually does, require the claimant to give a cross-undertaking in damages. In planning cases, this may involve an entirely uncertain potential liability of several thousand, if not several hundreds of thousands of pounds. Developer third parties have an incentive not to underestimate the potential loss from the imposition of an injunction, precisely to scare the claimant away from seeking one. As a result, injunctions are rarely pursued by individuals and NGOs in environmental cases. The consequences of this can be irreversible ­ as witnessed by the RSPB's pyrrhic victory at Lappel Bank in Kent.58 The Working Group is aware of a recent private nuisance application concerning a potential failure to comply with the EIA Regulations 1999, in which the claimants have some £25,000 liability arising out of the discharge of an injunction in circumstances in which the High Court had previously concluded that the claimants were entitled to an injunction. The claimants are appealing the costs order on the grounds that it is prohibitively expensive and contrary to Articles 9(3) and (4) of .59 This is believed to be the first appeal against a costs order under the Convention.

74. There is a critical link between timeliness and injunctive relief. If a case in which injunctive relief would be needed to ensure that the outcome of the case is not predetermined could be heard quickly, the potential losses suffered by a third party, and hence the probability that any surety would be required from the claimant (or at least very high levels of surety), could be significantly reduced. While there is a general case management discretion to consider prioritising urgent cases, there is currently a backlog in listing even expedited cases for hearing in the Administrative Court in which all environmental judicial reviews are heard.
75. This delay contrasts sharply with trends in the town and country planning system, for which the courts represent the ultimate forum of appeal. For example, the government has cut the time taken to decide cases determined by the Secretary of State by half, with 85% of cases decided within 16 weeks in 2006. Similarly, some three quarters of local planning authorities are now meeting the government target of 60% of major applications being dealt with within 13 weeks.60 Furthermore, both the recent White Paper and the Barker Review of Land Use Planning61 seek to introduce further refinements to the town and country planning system to make it more efficient and responsive. It is regrettable that the `other end of the process' continues to fall further and further behind.



Removing the barriers to injunctive relief
76. Both  Implementation Guide62 and the Handbook on Access to Justice under 63 reinforce the unique aspects of injunctions in environmental litigation, while recognising that practice and experience vary greatly between contracting parties. The Handbook recognises the barrier that so-called `bond' payments represent, and makes a number of recommendations as to their use.
77. The first suggestion is simply to eliminate bonds where they exist on the basis that they are not in use in many countries with well developed injunctive practice ­ such as France, Germany, Hungary and Italy. The Handbook suggests that a second option is to `cap' or fix a limit on the amount of surety that can be required (sometimes referred to as a `symbolic bond'), which sets the limit at an amount that can be raised by many individuals and/or NGOs. None of the jurisdictions the Working Group examined adopted such an approach and, as a result, we are reluctant to comment on its potential suitability in the UK.

79. While the wording of the standards varies from country to country, the end result is the same. Injunctions are used in limited circumstances, when the potential for significant harm is great, and only after a variety of factors, including economic impact, are considered. The Handbook points out that, if consistently applied, these standards enable the effective application of injunctive relief in all appropriate instances without imposing unreasonable financial burdens on claimants seeking it.
80. In the UK, an Administrative Court judge will consider many, if not all, of these issues in deciding whether to grant injunctive relief. However, we see merit in formalising a `test' for the Court which sets out pre-determined factors which require the prevention of significant environmental harm and preservation of the factual basis of the legal proceedings until the case is concluded. Although we recognise that there will sometimes be competing public interests, in such cases the consideration of such interests should only form part of such a test on the basis that the upholding of environmental law is in itself considered to be a matter of general public importance.
Automatic suspension

78. A number of countries have adopted an entirely different approach to those outlined above, which seeks to protect third parties that have been forced to cease activities as a result of an injunction and that can suffer large financial losses as a consequence. These countries have responded to this problem by developing precise legal standards for when an injunction may, or may not, be issued.64
62 Available on the UNECE website at www.unece.org/env/pp/ acig.htm 63 Available on the UNECE website at www.unece.org/env/pp/ publications.htm 64 The Handbook on Access to Justice under  lists Hungary, the United States and the Netherlands as examples of jurisdictions in which such an approach is adopted.

81. Finally, a number of jurisdictions have adopted another approach to eliminating `bond' and defendant lawsuit problems by providing that bringing an action in an administrative court results in the suspension of the concerned administrative act. In that sense it acts as an automatic injunction. This automatic injunction remains in place until the final court decision, and, since the injunction actually directly refers to an administrative act rather than the economic activity enabled by such an act, there is no requirement for surety. In France, the commencement of an action does not trigger an automatic suspensive effect, but the judge may, at the request of the claimant, stay the execution of the decision (i) in case of emergency: and (ii) if there are sufficient grounds to doubt the validity of the said decision. No surety is required in this eventuality.

28
Timeliness and Aarhus

82. Aarhus provides a robust justification for the removal of the need to provide a cross-undertaking in damages in environmental cases. We recognise that this may prejudice third parties in cases that can take many months to come to trial, and it is clear that timeliness has a critical role to play in environmental cases where interim injunctive relief in sought, and indeed is one of the express requirements of Aarhus. We recommend that the requirement to provide a cross-undertaking in damages should not apply in environmental cases falling within Aarhus where the court is satisfied that an injunction is required to prevent significant environmental damage and to preserve the factual basis of the proceedings. In such cases it will be incumbent on the court and its administration to ensure that the full case is heard promptly.
83. We also note that the Aarhus restriction on prohibitively costly procedures applies equally to the costs associated with an injunction. It follows that a claimant in an environmental case should not be expected to pay the costs of defendants and third parties in resisting an injunction (whether granted or not) at the permission stage where those costs are judged to be prohibitively expensive.

84. Timeliness is also an important factor in review procedures generally, and Article 9(4) of  expressly requires that procedures are ""timely"". Many countries have already recognised the importance of timeliness to the administration of justice. For example, in Belarus, appeals and complaints regarding environmental administrative decisions must be considered within one month, with a possible extension of an additional two months. In Ireland, courts have the discretion to pull certain cases from the docket queue and deal with them immediately when the case involves issues of an urgent and time-sensitive nature. The lengthy delays in the Administrative Court are of particular concern in the environmental field. Very urgent cases are expedited, but this delays the less urgent environmental challenges still further. Unless something is done to speed up the judicial review process overall, there is a real risk that the Court's procedures will not comply with Aarhus in terms of timeliness.


13 Case management in environmental judicial review
85. The judicial review procedures and the Administrative Court have become more efficient over recent years, but we feel there is still room for further improvement in order to meet the need to improve access to justice in line with Aarhus. Improved case management along the lines we suggest below will increase the efficiency in handling environmental cases, and assist in reducing overall costs for all parties involved.
Early disclosure of information
86. The importance of the prospective parties having full and proper information about the decision-making process to be challenged is well recognised. Where it applies,65 the Pre-action Protocol for Judicial Review66 recommends that the claimant's letter before claim includes both ""details of information sought"" and ""details of any documents that are considered relevant and necessary"". The protocol provides that, unless the claim is being conceded in full, the prospective defendant should ""enclose any relevant documentation requested by the claimant, or explain why the documents are not being enclosed"".

87. The protocol is stated not to impose on public authorities a greater disclosure obligation than already provided for ""in statute and common law"". The protocol reflects the recognition that judicial review is intended to be ""a process which falls to be conducted with all the cards face upwards on the table and [where] the vast majority of the cards will start in the [public] authority's hands""67 and the emphasis that is placed by the court on the defendant's duty of candour in the face of judicial review proceedings. That is the reason why court ordered disclosure in judicial review has generally been far more restrained than in general civil litigation.68
88. Furthermore, there are strong practical reasons why it is important for the public authority to provide a claimant with full information as to the decision under prospective challenge before proceedings are issued. The provision of information at that stage allows the prospective claimant to assess the strength of his position before deciding whether to take the costly and time-consuming step of issuing proceedings. The absence of adequate information at a pre-action stage can either (a) have an inhibiting effect because a prospective claimant cannot justify the risk involved in issuing proceedings without knowing the full picture; or (b) have the opposite effect of proceedings being issued in circumstances where early disclosure would have made clear that the case had no real prospects of success. The problem is, of course, particularly acute in judicial review proceedings because of the strict time limits. Numerous examples exist of situations in which late disclosure of information has significantly affected the outcome of a case in either direction in such a way that significant time and costs could have been avoided had such information been made available at an early pre-action stage.

Case management in environmental judicial review

89. In theory, the introduction of the ""right to know"" provisions of the Environmental Information Regulations 200469 (EIR 2004), and to a lesser extent the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA 2000), should have assisted in that process. The EIR 2004 provide that a public authority shall make available environmental information on request (Reg. 5). The obligation is to make that information available ""as soon as possible and no later than 20 working days after the date of receipt of the request"" (Reg. 5(2)). Public authorities are entitled to extend that time by a further 20 working days where the complexity and volume of the information make such extension necessary (Reg. 7).70 Where a request under the EIR 2004 is refused or not responded to, then an application for an internal review may be made. The public authority then has a further 40 working days to deal with that request. Beyond that, a complaint may be made to the Information Commissioner and subsequently to the Information Tribunal ­ each being very lengthy processes.
90. Difficulties arise because requests for information and documentation in a pre-action protocol letter are frequently and wrongly treated by the public authority as requests for information under EIR 2004/FOIA 2000. The material to be disclosed and exemptions of each type of disclosure duties are in fact different and overlapping. While that should not be problematic, claimant practitioners have noted an unfortunate unintended consequence of the introduction of that legislation and its interaction with judicial review. Public authorities in receipt of a pre-action protocol letter respond to the legal arguments but state erroneously that any requests for information/ documentation will be responded to in due course under the EIR 2004/FOIA 2000. That request is then handled under the authority's FOIA/EIR processes.

As noted above, the timescales for responding to requests for information under EIR 2000 are much longer than under the pre-action protocol. While the EIR 2004 does provide that information should be provided ""as soon as possible"", the reality is that persons dealing with FOIA/EIR in public authorities tend to operate to the FOIA/EIR timescales (20 working days initially) and do not operate with the same sense of urgency as do those practising public law. No appropriate expedition procedures are in existence for urgent requests for information. The exemptions available to the public body under the FOIA/EIA provisions are significantly different from the criteria applied by the court in JR disclosure.
91. These difficulties, combined with the strict time limits for bringing judicial review proceedings, mean that relevant information is often not provided within adequate time to assist the claimant to decide (a) whether to bring proceedings and, if so, (b) how to present the case. Even when the approach is contested, it results in further and unnecessary delay and pre-action procedural wrangling that ought not to occur.
92. This practice has the potential seriously to undermine effective access to justice in environmental matters. Such an outcome is wholly contrary to the approach adopted in Aarhus under which it is recognised that the two pillars (access to information and access to justice) are closely linked. One of the purposes of access to environmental information is precisely to assist members of the public and representative groups to determine whether environmental law is being complied with and, if not, to challenge any breaches.71

69 The Environmental Information Regulations 2004 implement Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information and repealing Directive 90/31/EEC (the Directive), which itself is a partial implementation of . 70 For non-environmental information, a public authority has far greater latitude to extend time for responding to information without any fixed time limit at all.

71 Even in the non-environmental field, it is explicitly recognised that one of the main public interests underlying access to information held by public authorities is ""allowing individuals and companies to understand decisions made by public authorities affecting their lives and, in some cases, assisting individuals in challenging those decisions"" (Information Commissioner's Awareness Guidance Note 3 ­ The Public Interest Test).

31
Case management in environmental judicial review

93. We consider that public authorities ought to ensure that their new additional obligations to release environmental (and other) information under EIR 2004/FOIA 2000 enhance rather than detract from their duty of candour in the face of anticipated judicial review proceedings and that when responding to a request for information/ documentation in a pre-action protocol letter, such information is provided within the timescales set out under the Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol (i.e. usually 14 days).
94. We also consider that the parties and the judge need access to basic and easily identifiable information from an early stage, which includes details about the claimant, the defendant, any interested parties (including the beneficiary of the decision under challenge) and any potential interveners; and their respective positions.
95. Given its generic framework and stated applicability only to those decisions that the potential defendant has the power to change, the Protocol does not provide for such exchange. We believe some guidance focused on environmental law judicial reviews ­ which bring particular complexities ­ should in future be included in the Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, and would assist in ensuring compliance with Aarhus.

96. We also see considerable benefit to all parties involved in an Aarhus environmental case including the court for there to be some guidance on the sort of information that all potential parties should seek or expect to be provided with, as well as offering or expecting to provide each other, whether voluntarily or in response to a clear question. The guidance need not be binding on either the parties to whom it is directed or on the judges dealing with cases to which it applied. But its existence ­ and the fact that all parties would be aware of it ­ would help to promote a consistency of approach to the exercise of discretions in this area and enable better decision-making, which we believe would be in the interests of all concerned. Appendix 5 contains a suggested framework for the information requirements.
Early consideration of costs and related matters
97. Early consideration of issues such as costs, injunctions and information improves access to environmental justice for claimants as well as providing greater predictability of process for defendants and interested parties.
98. At the moment, all those questions can be considered within the existing framework and process of judicial review, but there is no guarantee that they will be. We recommend that there should be an expectation that there will be early consideration of those issues. We do not believe this requires any rule changes ­ merely a change in practice, perhaps based on judicial guidance.

99. We recommend that, at the first point that an environmental judicial review to which Aarhus applies comes before a judge on the papers (whether for JR permission or an earlier application, say, for an injunction or directions), the judge should expressly consider what orders are needed to secure compliance with the requirements of Aarhus, including those relating to (1) costs, (2) timing, (3) interim relief, and (4) information and documentation. The parties should provide the judge with the information necessary to consider those matters, such as that contemplated by the guidance we recommend in para 94.


Judges with expertise in environmental law
100. Full compliance with Aarhus inevitably leads, in the context of the present JR arrangements in England and Wales, to potentially increased costs for defendants to environmental judicial reviews. As discussed in the following paragraphs, we do not consider that the likely numbers of cases involved will be unduly high. Nonetheless, we consider that it is necessary and appropriate for Aarhus judicial reviews to be handled, particularly at the initial stages during which questions such as permission, interim relief and costs are being considered, by judges with expertise and experience in such environmental cases. That will also provide an important safeguard for defendants, public funders (such as the LSC) and indeed the court to ensure that only cases of sufficient merit proceed and that they do so on an appropriate basis. We appreciate that to some extent this is to put such cases into a different category to other judicial reviews, but we consider that the need to comply with Aarhus justifies such an approach.

14 Numbers of cases likely to be involved
101. We have tried to gain a broad and up-to-date understanding of the current number of applications for environmental judicial reviews made in the Administrative Court on an annual basis and any predicted annual increase in cases that may result if prohibitive cost barriers were, in effect, removed.
102. Previous reports have noted the absence of any centrally held judicial statistics on environmental law matters.72 However, in 2003, Macrory and Woods73 examined a number of cases from categories that would contain environmental cases74 and reported the number of environmental judicial review applications lodged in the Administrative Court between 1999 and 2002 as follows: 2000 ­ 13; 2001 ­ 23; 2002 ­ 19 (total 55 and average per year 18).
103. The Working Group approached the Administrative Court for more recent data on environmental cases, but unfortunately environmental cases are still not categorised separately. However, figures are available by date lodged in the following relevant categories:



104. Environmental cases comprise only a small proportion of the total number of cases; around 20 cases per year. These figures also confirm that there has been no great change in the volume or make up of cases in the last five years. These figures are supported by information provided by environmental NGOs that routinely consider judicial review as a mechanism to challenge the decisions of public bodies. Information supplied to WWF in 2007 from Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on the number of JRs pursued between 1990 and 2007 shows that, at most, each organisation undertook an average of one environmental judicial review a year over the sample period, and in some years they brought no cases at all.

106. It may be argued that the number of environmental cases pursued each year will substantially increase if costs barriers were removed or alleviated in the way we have suggested. However, the Working Group has found no basis for the `floodgates' argument. Judicial review is not undertaken lightly by individuals or NGOs, and such cases are resource intensive and inherently high risk. It is essentially a remedy of last resort in every sense.76 Our judgment is that there would be a modest increase in environmental applications, but, particularly if our recommendations concerning improved case management were adopted, not so large that they could not be handled by the Administrative Court.

105. It would therefore appear that the number of cases that may be affected by the conclusions of this report will not be unduly high, and it needs to be seen against the much larger number of judicial review applications handled by the Administrative Court as a whole. In 2005, 1,981 applications for permission (excluding immigration and criminal cases) were received, of which 412 were granted.75

75 Department of Constitutional Affairs Judicial Statistics (Revised) 2006.

76 An interesting parallel can be drawn with the European Courts of Justice, in which the costs position is very different to the UK courts. The Rules of Procedure for the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice restrict costs recovery for successful Community Institutions to internal expenses including mail, photocopying, travel and subsistence expenses. In a recent case, WWF-UK was requested to pay costs incurred by the European Council of 360 euros for a case in the Court of First Instance which included an oral hearing. With such low costs exposure, one might expect NGOs to pursue many more claims in the ECJ. However, this is not the case. In our sample above, only Greenpeace and WWF had ever pursued a case in the ECJ, despite the very low costs exposure. We recognise that standing barriers may also inhibit the number of cases pursued before the ECJ.

34
Conclusions

107. If our judgment is wrong on this, it still does not detract from the need to comply with the Aarhus requirements concerning access to environmental justice. In this context we note that under sections 15-21 Courts and Tribunal Act 2007, the new Upper Tribunal will have jurisdiction to handle most types of judicial review applications, including environmental law cases, either in respect of classes of cases made in a direction by the Lord Chief Justice under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, or in any particular case where on application the High Court decides to transfer the case to the Upper Tribunal because it determines ""it is just and convenient to do so"". If there was a substantial rise in environmental judicial review applications, it may be that the Upper Tribunal would provide a suitable forum for reducing an unacceptable overload on the Administrative Court.77 As we have indicated, however, our current view is that the number of additional cases in the immediate future is unlikely to be sufficiently large to require this to happen, but we recognise that the new Tribunal system could provide a valuable forum should it be needed in the future.

15 Conclusions
108.  and core EC Environmental Directives require that members of the public including environmental organisations have access to legal review procedures before the courts or other independent bodies that are ""fair, equitable, timely and not prohibitively expensive"". The UK government is currently relying on judicial review as satisfying these access to environmental justice requirements.
109. We are satisfied that the requirement that procedures must not be prohibitively expensive relates not just to the size of the court fees required for lodging an application for judicial review, but includes the total exposure to costs, including the risk of being ordered to pay costs to other parties should the application fail, and any requirements concerning cost undertakings for interim injunctive relief.
110. We welcome the fact that the Legal Services Commission has now made explicit reference to the requirements of Aarhus in its Guidance, but recognise that legal aid cannot provide the total answer to satisfying Aarhus. We consider that the costs, both actual and risked, would be prohibitively expensive under Aarhus if they would reasonably inhibit an `ordinary' person who would not be eligible for legal aid from embarking on an environmental challenge falling within Aarhus.

77 We note that the intention behind the provisions was not to seek a wholesale transfer of judicial review cases to the Upper Tribunal, nor were environmental cases in mind. ""The intention is to refer to the upper tier of the tribunal issues that are currently dealt with by the High Court; for example, specific tax questions or vires questions about, say, social security, and some immigration questions that, with the agreement of the Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor, would be better dealt with by tribunals."" (Lord Falconer of Thoroton, Hansard, House of Lords 29 Nov. 2006 col. 762.)

111. We conclude that the current principles concerning costs and the potential exposure to costs in judicial review proceedings in England and Wales inhibit compliance with the requirements of Aarhus concerning access to environmental justice. `Walk away' agreements under which each party bears their costs whatever the outcome of the case may continue to be appropriate for cases taken by some larger environmental organisations, but are unlikely to provide an acceptable solution for individuals or smaller organisations.

35
Summary of key recommendations

112. We have identified a number of principles and mechanisms that could be adopted within the current discretionary powers of the judiciary concerning costs. They build on existing practices, but are developed to reflect the requirements of Aarhus explicitly. We feel that these should eventually be reflected in a Practice Direction or the Civil Procedure Rules and applied to those cases to which Aarhus applies. But we recommend that they should first be applied by the judiciary within their existing discretionary powers to allow for a period of learning and refinement in practice before being codified.

16 Summary of key recommendations

1.

We would encourage the Legal Services

Commission to develop its initiatives concerning vari-

ous combinations of funding, such as a partnership

approach between legal aid and non-governmen-

tal organisations, and to do so in cooperation with

non-governmental organisations and other interested

bodies in future environmental litigation.

113. We also make a number of recommendations concerning the improvement of case management in environmental judicial review that will assist in early identification and resolution of Aarhus requirements, and lead to a more effective use of court time and resources.

2.

Given that the current Protective Costs Order

(PCO) principles were not developed with Aarhus

in mind and clearly contain constraints that are not

consistent with the Convention, we recommend that

a bespoke approach to PCOs be adopted in environ-

mental cases to which Aarhus applies.

114. We have emphasised that Aarhus does not entitle members of the public to bring manifestly unreasonable legal challenges, but does imply that procedures need to be developed to ensure that costs and the risk of exposure to costs are not so prohibitively expensive as to inhibit the Aarhus rights to environmental legal challenge. Throughout this report we have focused on approaches that could be reasonably and rapidly introduced within the existing procedural framework and which, if adopted, would in our view go a long way to ensuring that the UK complies with its Aarhus obligations in England and Wales.

3.

For a case falling within the terms of Aarhus

and where a PCO is sought, the overarching require-

ment must be for a PCO that secures compliance

with Aarhus. Conditions relating to the requirement of

general public importance and no private interest that

might still be applicable to PCOs in other types of

cases but which are inconsistent with Aarhus would

not apply. If the individual Aarhus claimant, acting

reasonably in the circumstances, would be prohibited

by the level of costs or cost risks from bringing the

case, then the court must make some form of PCO

to ensure compliance.

4.

The Aarhus requirements that procedures

are not prohibitively expensive are not confined only

to cases once they have been granted permission,

but will equally apply to the claimant while establish-

ing whether a case has merit. The Court of Appeal's

advice that costs at the permission stage should be

proportionate needs to be particularly followed in the

case of Aarhus claims, and should generally be set at

a very modest level.

36
Summary of key recommendations

5.

We recommend that where a limited compa-

ny is the claimant in a case to which Aarhus applies,

judicial consideration is given to the level at which

security for costs is set so as ensure compliance with

the requirements of the Convention.

6.

In relation to costs awards against defend-

ants, we do not suggest there is any fundamental

change in the current principles but recommend that

the Aarhus obligation must be taken into account in

exercising the discretion on whether to depart from

the usual rule that costs follow the event.

10. We consider that public authorities ought to ensure that their new additional obligations to release environmental (and other) information under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 enhance rather than detract from their duty of candour in the face of anticipated judicial review proceedings and that when responding to a request for information and/or documentation in a pre-action protocol letter such information is provided within the timescales set out under the Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol (i.e. usually 14 days).

7.

We recommend that (whether the case is

legally aided or the claimant proceeds on a CFA or

other similar basis):

(1) Where a claimant has been substantially

successful in their environmental challenge (such

as where the court has concluded that the decision

was unlawful) but the court has then withheld relief

on purely discretionary grounds (i.e. the claimant has

substantially won), the claimant should be treated as

having `won' for the purposes of the general costs

rule that the loser pays the winner's cost; and

(2) Where the claimant has `won' (actually or

substantially) the general position (i.e. that the loser

pays the winner's costs, including any CFA uplift)

should prevail.

8.

We recommend that the normal requirement

to provide a cross-undertaking in damages where an

interim injunction is sought should not apply in envi-

ronmental cases falling within Aarhus where the court

is satisfied that an injunction is required to prevent

significant environmental damage and to preserve

the factual basis of the proceedings. In such cases it

will be incumbent on the court and its administration

to ensure that the full case be heard promptly.

11. We also consider that the parties and the judge need access to basic and easily identifiable information from an early stage, which includes details about the claimant, the defendant, any interested parties (including the beneficiary of the decision under challenge) and any potential interveners, and their respective positions.
12. We believe some guidance tailored to environmental law judicial reviews ­ which bring particular complexities ­ should in future be included in the Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, and would be of benefit and assist in ensuring compliance with Aarhus.
13. We also see considerable benefit for all parties involved in an Aarhus environmental case, including the court, for there to be some guidance on the sort of information that all potential parties should seek or expect to be provided with and to provide to each other, whether voluntarily or in response to a clear question.

9.

A claimant in an environmental case should

not be expected to pay the defendant's (or interested

party's) costs in resisting an injunction (whether

granted or not) at the permission stage where those

costs are judged to be prohibitively expensive.

How we inspired change

high notes
Proud, footsore, inspired and humbled. A trek to document the positive changes we're making in Nepal left many lasting impressions on WWF's Greg Armfield. Changes that are helping locals to reduce their impact on the country's natural wonders.

I was struck by the scale of things in Nepal. Famously, the mountains here are the world's tallest, and the views are equally awe-inspiring.

But it was at the smaller scale that I was most impressed. Local communities here are working together, with our help, to reduce their impact on their threatened natural surroundings.

The wildlife that might wander into people's backyards here is rather grander than your usual. Hungry elephants can be quite a problem, destroying a farmer's crop in a single visit. This has led to conflict between people and wildlife.

""I saw countless examples of how
our innovative approaches were being
whole-heartedly embraced.""
Greg Armfield

But I saw how WWF has figured out an alternative ­ getting locals to grow mint as well. It brings in more money than rice, and is less attractive to elephants. Simple, but effective.
A common sight across Nepal was that of people weighed down by huge loads of fuelwood.
But on the outskirts of Chitwan national park, there's a village where 90% of residents now cook with biogas ­ methane produced from cow dung and human waste. It might sound like a pungent recipe, but the result is actually a far cleaner fuel.

No more chopping and carrying, no more wood smoke in people's houses, and far less pressure on the park's precious resources. A real success, thanks to a project we funded.

On the borders of another national park ­ Bardia ­ I saw the positive impacts of the work we started here 10 years ago. Our initiative involves helping local communities look after their own patch of forest sustainably (see photo on previous pages), and ensure they leave grass growing for rhinos and elephants. This includes creating cooperatives that enable locals to take out loans at low interest rates.

The upshot? Some of the poorest people have been given a chance to earn a decent living ­ setting up a shop, or becoming pig or goat owners. This means they no longer need to take from the forests we're trying to safeguard. Instead they feel like they have a real stake in the future of this area.

Because of their ongoing success, similar schemes are now sprouting up across Nepal.

I saw countless examples of how our small-scale, innovative approaches were being whole-heartedly embraced by the irrepressible locals here. It made me feel hopeful, proud and humbled.


We're optimistic about the future. How can that be, when the planet is overheating? When millions face devastation? When the survival of special places and vulnerable creatures hangs by a thread? We're feeling positive because we're taking practical steps to give the world a brighter future.

We're tackling three really big challenges:
1. Conservation Safeguarding the natural world has always been close to our hearts. Our forests, oceans, rivers and lakes are under severe threat. Unless we protect them, countless creatures that depend on them could vanish. It could also jeopardise the livelihoods of many millions of people. We're not going to stand by and watch that happen.
2. Climate change Climate change is a reality. But there's still plenty we can do to protect our planet, people and wildlife. Such as drastically cutting global greenhouse gas emissions. Getting politicians and ordinary people to open their minds and change their ways. And finding new ways to cope with the changes we're already living with.

3. Sustainability We can all learn to use fewer natural resources. It's vital that we do. Because if everyone in the world lived like we do in the UK, it would take nearly three planet Earths to support us. And we can't forget the wildlife that share the same resources.

These challenges are tough. But they're not insurmountable. We've got the experience and the scientific know-how. We've got the passion and the determination to strive for a better future for nature, and for people. What we need is support: from communities, from politicians, from governments. And from you.

conservation
Everything we do is connected. Lose a habitat and the animals it supports go too. Cut down a forest and the threat of climate change grows. Leave people in poverty and they may destroy the local habitat to survive.
Nearly a quarter of all mammals and a third of amphibians are threatened with extinction. A billion people don't have access to safe drinking water. Our natural world is in crisis.
But since 1961 WWF has fought to break these patterns of destruction and waste. And we still are. Helping to ensure people and nature can live harmoniously ­ and thrive.
How do we do all this? We're on the ground in the world's most important wild places, creating real solutions to real problems. We're also in the corridors of power when our expertise is needed most.

Thanks to our lobbying, 15,000 sq km of the Russian Arctic is now

a protected park. We've persuaded the Russian government to ban

all industrial activity in the reserve, which is in Novaya Zemlya, an

island that points out into the Arctic Ocean between the Barents

and Kara seas. So its polar bears, walruses, reindeer and many bird

species can live free from disturbance and pollution.

13% Island reserve One of the world's largest marine protected areas has been set up

around the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands. It'll help protect

the region's diverse wildlife. Large numbers of albatross that breed

here have been killed by illegal boats targeting Patagonian toothfish.

We drafted management plans for the reserve, and worked closely

for years with the South African government to achieve this success.

80 canals River restored

3

We've helped to close more than 80 unauthorised canals that were

taking water from Tanzania's Great Ruaha River. Since the early

1990s, over-abstraction for crop irrigation caused the mighty river

to run dry for many days a year. Our work over several years with

the water authority has considerably improved the flow, which is

a vital source of water for six million people, and wildlife including

elephants, hippos and crocodiles.

4

100m Wetland landmark The creation of a protected wetland site in the high Andes has helped

us meet a pledge to conserve 100 million hectares of wetlands in

just 10 years. The newly-protected Catamarca Lagunas complex

in Argentina is home to two species of flamingo, and threatened

Andean cats. Now we're making an even bigger pledge ­ to protect

250 million hectares of wetlands by 2015.

5

35 Whale boost Our determination to save one of the world's most endangered

whales had a welcome boost. We convinced the oil and gas

consortium Sakhalin Energy to suspend seismic testing around

Sakhalin Island in the Russian Far East. This is a crucial breeding

and feeding area for the western Pacific gray whale. Just 35 breeding

females remain. The sound frequencies used in these seismic tests

are known to distress the whales.

6

1/3 Leopard lifeline We're working with the first timber company to have been awarded

a `conservation concession' in the Russian Far East. The Nerpinskoye

Cooperative Society has been leased 45,000 hectares in an area

where most of the remaining leopards are found. The project will

enable us to restore vital habitat for critically endangered Amur

leopards and their prey. And to increase coverage of forest

by a third over the next 40 years.

7

700 Pandas reunited We're working with the Chinese government to bring 700 giant

pandas back together in China's Minshan mountains. That's nearly

half the giant pandas left in the wild. Since the 1950s, a busy road

has divided them into two groups. We've fought for years to get the

road rerouted. Now a new 11km tunnel will do just that. We're also

planting 80 sq km of arrow bamboo to give them a steady food supply.

8

5+ Rhino hope Our new video traps have allowed us to check on the health and

behaviour of Javan rhinos. We've spotted encouraging signs ­ five

females have new calves. The monitoring helps us identify suitable rhinos

to move to a new site where we'll establish a second viable population.

This is essential as, with fewer than 60 Javan rhinos surviving, the

species could be easily wiped out by disease or natural disaster.

9

20% Logging breakthrough Our campaign to stop illegal logging led to a strengthened draft

of the proposed EU timber regulation. The European Parliament

incorporated tougher checks and penalties in a new law governing

trade in timber. This is a milestone in our work to stop massive forest

destruction worldwide. Our research shows that almost one-fifth

of wood imported into the EU in 2006 was from illegal sources.

Ten years ago we helped set up the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)

to help preserve fish stocks. Now, the MSC has certified major cod

and haddock fisheries in Norway as being harvested sustainably. Many

other Norwegian fisheries are also expected to be accredited. This

will make the country the world's biggest provider of MSC-certified

fish. And set an example for other nations to follow.

An act of Ten years ago we launched a campaign to safeguard the UK's
dedication seas. A decade on, our dedication has led to legal protection that's among the most comprehensive
to our seas in the world. When a WWF report showed that some of the most precious species and habitats in UK waters were greatly threatened, we knew we had to act. ""The UK had lost about 80% of its saltmarshes, which provide nursery areas for fish and act as a buffer against flooding and storms. Seahorses, harbour porpoises and a plethora of other wildlife were in severe decline,"" says Simon Walmsley, our marine expert.

""It's unique ­ a potential one-stop shop for deciding on all things marine. This is the element I'm proudest to have
helped achieve.""
Simon Walmsley

Then we spotted an opportunity. The UK had signed up to international agreements to improve management of the seas and create protected areas. So we pressed the UK government and devolved administrations to introduce a law to meet these commitments.
""After repeated knock-backs from certain industry lobbies and delays in Parliament, finally it's a done deal,"" Simon adds.
""And it's unique. Nowhere else on the planet will have a Marine Management Organisation [MMO] ­ a potential one-stop shop for deciding on all things marine. This is the element I'm proudest to have helped achieve. If the UK gets it right, the MMO will not only help solve environmental problems but also manage human developments, such as many renewable energy projects at sea, more effectively.""

Our global presence has been crucial. Our knowledge of what's happening elsewhere on the planet allowed us to highlight marine protection efforts in other countries that have been successful. We've also advised against those that haven't.

Our influence in all countries across the UK has also made a difference. ""We've managed to get stakeholders to see beyond political boundaries when agreeing how to protect marine resources,"" notes Simon. ""After all, fish don't know whether they're in Scotland or England.""



The work isn't over. Next up, we'll make sure the legislation is implemented effectively. We can't put in so much time and effort and not follow it through.
For Simon, a lifelong sea angler, there's also a personal motivation: ""When I was small, if I went fishing off a pier I would always catch mackerel. Now I have to go 20 miles out to catch anything decent. I'd love to see their return in abundance ­ it'd be a real indicator that we're taking good care of our seas.""

Green sky A billion trees. Our new Amazon rainforest campaign with Sky will show they're worth more if they're thinking left standing. For the people who live there. For the wildlife of the Amazon. And for the planet.

The Amazon rainforest contains possibly the greatest diversity of life on Earth. It's crucial for regulating the world's climate. And it's home to 30 million people, almost all of whom rely on the forest for their food, shelter and livelihoods.

""Finding new ways to help these people make a living from forests, while ensuring the trees are left standing, is fundamental to the future of the Amazon,"" says Sarah Hutchison, who leads our forests work in Brazil.

""Finding new ways to help these people
make a living from forests, while ensuring the trees
are left standing, is fundamental to the future of the Amazon.""
Sarah Hutchison

So this year, with Sky, we launched a campaign called Sky Rainforest Rescue to show that the forests can be worth more alive than felled. And to save a billion trees, across three million hectares.
We're working in Acre, a state in western Brazil where 12% of the forest cover has been lost. The area we're focusing on first is particularly vulnerable to increased rates of deforestation because a major highway that's currently being paved runs through it.
""New roads improve access to untouched areas, so you find higher levels of illegal logging,"" Sarah explains. ""Where the highway is paved there are only small pockets of forest left. In stark contrast, along the unpaved sections the forest is largely intact.""
We're trialling economic incentives for local people to look after their forests. Participants who sign up commit to measures such as not chopping down mature forest or using fires to manage their land. In return, they get technical assistance on managing their land more productively; priority access to credit; and even a modest cash bonus for meeting their commitments.

""The first indications are good,"" says Sarah ""We've heard that fire use has dramatically reduced on farms that have signed up to the voluntary scheme. And the commitment of the governor of Acre and his team are truly inspiring. I'm thrilled that we're making a difference.""




Forested areas and patches cleared for cattle pasture in Acre, Brazil. Such deforestation is much more common next to roads or navigable rivers, where access is easier. Real progress has been made in slowing the rate of deforestation in Acre.

climate change
We're ready for our most daunting challenge yet. Millions of people worldwide will suffer the consequences if climate change spirals out of control. It'll also threaten the places and animals we've done so much to care for. And we're already seeing the effects. Some of the planet's coral reefs, for example, are bleaching and dying as the seas warm.
For a good chance of keeping the rise in global temperatures to less than the critical 2°C threshold, we need to slash the world's greenhouse gas emissions by 80% before 2050. We need to end our reliance on fossil fuels. We need to stop destroying our tropical forests. And we need to find new ways to deal with the changes we're already starting to see.
How is WWF helping to achieve all this? Through tireless campaigning. By spurring on like-minded people. And by convincing world leaders to do the right thing.


a big deal A melting polar bear in Trafalgar Square. Thousands joining the biggest wave of support for climate change action. And our experts working day and night to influence world leaders. We pulled out all the stops to press for a fair and ambitious climate deal.

Heads of government from 119 countries gathered in Copenhagen in December to try to reach an agreement on how the world tackles climate change. It was an unprecedented turnout, making us hopeful that they were taking seriously the biggest environmental threat to people and wildlife.

But, at best, the UN climate summit was chaotic. At worst, it was moments away from total failure.

Following a series of all-night talks, the upshot is the Copenhagen Accord. This isn't the legally-binding agreement we were calling for. Just a voluntary arrangement where countries can set their own emission reduction targets. So, there are no guarantees that it'll result in the cuts needed to prevent dangerous climate change.

3ºC
Average global temperature rise we estimate under
the Copenhagen Accord

We estimate that what political leaders have put on the table adds up to at least 3°C warming. And that's of huge concern. Widespread devastation becomes inevitable after just a 2°C rise in global temperatures.
""With a lack of targets and money on the table, the Copenhagen Accord is too weak to address climate change appropriately,"" says Dr Keith Allott, who heads our climate programme.
But, he adds, there's still time to make a difference: ""The Accord could be a stepping stone to a fair and binding deal, if we build on the positive aspects. For instance, it's good news that it acknowledges the need to keep the global temperature increase below 2°C, and that there must be transparent international financial support for developing countries to tackle climate change.

""But a more ambitious, legally-binding agreement must be struck. World leaders must recognise that the job was not done at Copenhagen, and must seal the real deal before it's too late. It's that simple.""



Our team was a major presence at the Copenhagen conference ­ both inside and outside the negotiating rooms. We ensured that the voices of WWF and our supporters were heard loud and clear. Together with other organisations, we produced a 160-page draft treaty detailing the key elements needed in an agreement that avoids the worst impacts of climate change.

58,000
people joined The wave, backed by wwf, to
demand action on climate change

We were part of the UK's largest ever mass public demonstration on climate change ­ The Wave. The event, organised by the WWF-backed Stop Climate Chaos coalition, saw an estimated 50,000 people gather in London, and 8,000 more in Glasgow and Belfast, to demand action on climate change.
We handed in our Vote Earth petition, signed by almost 28,000 supporters, to climate and energy secretary Ed Miliband. The petition demanded that the EU pledges to cut emissions by at least 40% by 2020.

And in London's Trafalgar Square, we created a life-size ice sculpture of a polar bear to highlight that a warming planet will affect all life on Earth. The eye-catching bear, which melted to reveal its bronze skeleton, encouraged many passers-by to learn about climate change from our staff.

There's still everything to play for in 2010. Please sign up to WWF's Earth Hour and keep the heat on world leaders to deliver a fair and binding climate agreement. wwf.org.uk/earthhour

targets in both UK and Scotland climate change acts

Both the Scotland and UK climate change acts have set tough targets on greenhouse gas emissions ­ a reduction of at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. We now need to ensure that the governments drive the changes needed to achieve this. Key battles this year were over plans for a new coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth and a third

runway at Heathrow.

+30 yrs
The plan for the UK's first new coal plant in over 30 years has now
been shelved

Coal future? Two years of campaigning and legal work by WWF has paid off. We've been opposing the power company E.On's plans for a coal-fired power station at Kingsnorth in Kent. This would have been the first new coal plant in the UK for more than 30 years, and there were no firm provisions to capture and store the carbon it would emit. E.On has now shelved the project, a decision it claimed was due to the recession. But our efforts have undoubtedly had an impact.
The government has accepted that no new coal plants can be built in the UK without at least some level of carbon capture and storage. We've also gained significant support from politicians and business this year over the need to reduce energy consumption and strongly develop renewable energy.

Heathrow challenge Aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions in the UK. If government plans for a third runway at Heathrow go ahead, the airport will become the single largest generator of carbon in the UK. So we helped launch a legal challenge to the third runway and we're pressing for a wider review of the government's aviation policy. Our research shows that businesses are looking to cut business flights rather than increase them ­ which challenges the government's main justification for expansion.
Our new One in Five Challenge encourages businesses to reduce their flying. Find out more on page 33



The night Big Ben. The pyramids. Sydney Opera House. The Eiffel Tower.
the lights Why did these and hundreds of other world-famous landmarks plunge into darkness for an hour
went out on 28 March? WWF's Earth Hour was the reason. Our international lights-out event marked the launch of our campaign to show world leaders there's overwhelming support for action on climate change ­ the biggest global threat to wildlife, habitats and people.


A huge number of people joined in. Hundreds of millions of you, in more than 4,000 cities and towns in 88 countries, switched off your lights in the largest ever display of public concern about climate change.
In the UK, 750 businesses and 1,400 schools joined in too.
The lights were even turned off or dimmed at 10 Downing Street. Gordon Brown acknowledged the significance of the event: ""It shows just how passionately people feel about tackling climate change, and sends out a clear message that the world is ready to take action.""

WWF's Earth Hour was an instant success.

At the UN climate talks in Bonn, which started the following day, the executive secretary of the UN's climate change convention, Yvo de Boer, called on the delegates to heed Earth Hour and the huge show of public concern. He urged them to take action. We also organised a single-city Earth Hour in Copenhagen to coincide with the critical UN talks that took place there in December.




Climate change

On thin ice How far would you go to help protect the Arctic ice cap? Polar explorer Pen Hadow went 440km. On foot. Across the region's shrinking sea ice.

Enduring temperatures of -45°C. Noting 16,000 observations. And taking 1,500 measurements of ice and snow. The Catlin Arctic Survey was precisely as its leader, polar explorer Pen Hadow, describes it: ""A pioneering feat of human endurance combined with a scientific endeavour.""

""An entirely melted Arctic is unthinkable
­ it is one of our planet's defining features from space.""
Pen Hadow

But the groundbreaking survey, which we backed, has been well worthwhile. The expedition's intrepid trio ­ Pen, Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley ­ provided us with new, much-needed evidence about the state of Arctic sea ice. And in time to support our call for a strong global climate deal at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen.
Sea ice has an important cooling effect on the Earth's climate system ­ and its rapid disappearance from the Arctic directly threatens the polar bear. It also contributes to the warming of the planet.
The shrinking is already happening decades ahead of most predictions. The results from Pen's survey showed that the situation is more perilous than satellite image interpreters and computer models predicted.

""What we found was this younger, thinner ice,"" says Pen. The average depth of ice was just 1.77m ­ suggesting that it was almost all first-year ice, which is more likely to melt. ""Our scientific advisers had told us to expect thicker, older ice on at least part of the route. So it's a mystery where that older ice has gone.""

As well as the scientific need, Pen was driven by a powerful emotional connection he feels with the Arctic: ""I have a responsibility to this beautiful place, which has given me so much in the past. An entirely melted Arctic is unthinkable ­ it is one of our planet's defining features from space. We cannot allow the white lid to be taken off the planet.""

Polar explorer Ann Daniels pulls supplies through Arctic ice rubble, during the Catlin Arctic Survey's 73-day trip to provide new evidence about the state of the sea ice.

protecting Planting trees in the sea? It's just one way we're safeguarding the
a tropical people and wildlife of Belize from the dangers of climate change. WWF's Beth Marshall went to paradise see for herself. The Mesoamerican reef stretches over 1,000km, off the coast of Central America. Its corals and mangroves are home to an array of wildlife. From sea turtles to more than 500 species of fish.

But great swathes of mangroves have been cleared to make way for hotels, marinas and shrimp farms. This is putting the reef and the people who live near it in danger.

""When you fly over, it's plain to see where vast tracts of mangroves have been cleared,"" says Beth Marshall, who works in our climate change team.

""When you fly over, it's plain to see
where vast tracts of mangroves have
been cleared.""
Beth Marshall

""That's removed a vital line of defence. It's leaving low-lying places even more vulnerable to rising sea levels and more frequent storm surges.""
With funds from the UK government's Department for International Development, we're working with the people of Belize to turn the tide.
Beth explains: ""We're connecting with people from government policy makers to local communities. In Placencia, we're helping people understand why the mangroves reduce disaster risk. We've already planted around 12,000 new mangrove seedlings.""

We've also shown the Belize government how much its mangroves and corals are worth. A report we compiled with an environmental research organisation ­ the World Resources Institute ­ values them at US$395-559 million a year in terms of fisheries, tourism and shoreline defence. But only if they're properly protected.

""Showing the Belize government the incredible value of a protected reef has added weight to our calls to make sure that any coastal development is done sustainably,"" says Beth.



Our research is also proving popular with the locals and tourists. ""Tour guides are getting snorkellers involved. They're helping us to monitor impacts on the reef, by identifying areas of bleaching and different diseases on the coral.""
But our work needs to reach far beyond Belize's shores. ""Even if we cut all global emissions now, the climate will continue to change. All countries need to act now to adapt to more intense and frequent climatic events,"" Beth adds.
""We're using our findings to convince world leaders to agree on funding and measures to help vulnerable countries, communities and ecosystems adapt to the impacts of climate change.""
A natural partnership Our work on climate change adaptation in Central America is one of many WWF projects that the UK government's Department for International Development (DFID) funds. Our partnership works to improve environmental governance, which includes the way governments, civil society and businesses make decisions that impact on the environment. We focus on issues including poverty, climate change, sustainable consumption and trade. We've worked together since 1986, and DFID's latest support for us is worth £13.3 million between 2008 and 2011.
sustainability
How much stuff do we really need? If everyone had the same lifestyle as people in the developed world, it would take three planets to feed, clothe, transport and house them.
We only have one planet. But if we take better care of it, everyone can thrive. People and wildlife. Lots of us will have to change the way we live. It's not going to be easy changing people's habits. But with the right help and encouragement, it can be done.
How is WWF going about it? We're coming up with practical ways to make business and industry more sustainable. And we're promoting greener lifestyles.


Water footprint This year we published a groundbreaking report which was the first measurement of the UK's total `water footprint'. It highlighted how much of the water used to produce our food and cotton for our clothes comes from countries that are running out of fresh water.

""Huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future,"" says Stuart Orr, WWF's water expert. Water shortages threaten species, ecosystems and billions of people.

The average UK citizen uses 150 litres of mains water a day. But we consume about 30 times as much in `virtual' water ­ for example, water used to produce the food we eat and the clothes we wear

The UK is the world's sixth-largest importer of water. Understanding our water footprint is an important step towards better management of this most precious resource. We're working with governments, academics, NGOs and some of the world's largest companies to improve water stewardship, especially in countries where water is scarce.
Financial transformation This year, the world has felt the fallout from a financial system focused on short-term economic growth that puts business first. A huge transformation is urgently needed so that the needs of society and the environment are also considered. That's why we've helped launch the Finance Lab, a collaboration between representatives from finance, business, government, academia and civil society. Through the Finance Lab's innovations, we'll demonstrate how a redesigned financial system could act in the interests of business, society and the planet.

Guiding challenge We've been working with Girlguiding UK to challenge young people to take an active role in protecting the natural world. Our exciting collection of challenges, pledges and competitions inspired more than 34,000 girl guides to learn how the choices they make about food and shopping have a huge impact on wildlife and the environment. More than 90% of them went on to change their spending habits and reduce their consumption.



Welsh inspiration Wales has become the first country in the world to commit to a future using only its fair share of the limited resources of our planet ­ and the Welsh Assembly Government credited WWF Cymru with inspiring the move.
The government is already using the concept of ecological footprint, pioneered by WWF, to measure Wales' environmental impact. People in Wales, like the rest of the UK, currently live as if they have the resources of almost three planets at their disposal. The One Planet, One Wales scheme, launched at the Hay Festival in May, aims to bring this down to an equitable level by putting sustainable development at the heart of government.
Great British refurb We teamed up with TV presenter Kevin McCloud to launch the Grand Designs Great British Refurb campaign, which aims to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the UK's 26 million existing homes.
In July, we invited MPs and ministers to help Kevin insulate a 10fthigh model house outside Parliament. We also handed in a petition with more than 8,000 signatures calling on the government to do more to reduce household emissions.

UK homes are among the least energy efficient in Europe. They also make up more than a quarter of UK emissions. Insulating existing homes would save nearly 18 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year ­ equivalent to taking 5.5 million cars off the road. It would also create tens of thousands of new jobs and save households hundreds of pounds a year in energy bills.

Oil protest We urgently need to cut carbon emissions and invest in alternatives to fossil fuels. Yet energy companies pour vast sums into `dirty fuels' like tar sands, which cause three times the carbon emissions of conventional oil production. We're campaigning against these destructive projects.
In February, we protested outside the Canadian embassy about Canada's continued expansion of oil production from tar sands.



Canada's tar sands developments are so vast that they can be seen from space. Some US$379bn of projects to expand tar sands exploitation are set to be developed in Alberta, Canada, by 2025. They would cause untold damage to Alberta's forests and fresh water, and contribute to climate change. We're calling for them to be halted.

We were also invited in, to voice our concerns to the ambassador. As well as emitting unacceptably high levels of greenhouse gases, Canada's tar sands exploitation is destroying pristine forest, threatening wildlife and polluting water. Indigenous people who live downriver from the tar sands developments have seen an unusual number of cases of a rare cancer and other medical conditions.

Some US$379 billion of projects to expand tar sands exploitation are set to be developed by 2025

We've also highlighted that investments in dirty fuels are likely to falter in an increasingly carbon constrained future. This would affect many people's pension funds, billions of pounds of which are invested in energy companies. We've lobbied the government to demand that all UK companies in the energy sector report on their total carbon impact.

Fragrant success A new luxury perfume will provide a sustainable livelihood for nomadic people while helping protect elephants, rhinos and other wildlife in Namibia, thanks to a project we funded. While working with the Himba people, the project team identified a fragrant resin from a wild plant called omumbiri. The fragrance proved a hit with perfume giant Estée Lauder, which has now launched a scent based on it. Harvesting the resin will provide an important new source of income for the Himba.
We've been promoting sustainable livelihoods, such as ecotourism, in Namibia for many years. Local people are now seeing the economic benefits of protecting natural resources, and wildlife numbers are recovering as a result.

Campaigning for change We rely on our dedicated campaigners to support our work by contacting politicians about the issues they care about. Their action really helps to bring about change. We also work with politicians of all parties at the devolved, UK and European levels helping parliaments and assemblies to take action on climate change, resource use and the protection of nature.

ONE IN FIVE The UK government says we need more business air travel to fuel the economy. We know there are takes off far greener options. A growing number of companies are taking up our challenge to cut one in five flights.

""What's videoconferencing got to do with pandas?"" Lucy Bertenshaw has been asked this a lot in the last year. The answer is found in our One in Five Challenge, which Lucy is spearheading.

Businesses that sign up agree to cut their air travel by 20% over five years. By using alternatives like videoconferencing, they'll save money. They'll also cut greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change ­ the gravest global threat to people and wildlife.

""At WWF we don't do finger-wagging and say everyone's
got to stop flying. We put forward
positive solutions and say `what about
trying this?' ""
Lucy Bertenshaw

We launched the challenge after finding out that top UK companies are keen to reduce their business flying. But they need help in convincing staff to change the way they meet and travel.
We're showing that it's possible for businesses to fly less while remaining competitive. And that building more runways isn't necessary. We've mounted a legal challenge to the proposed third runway at Heathrow. But if the runway goes ahead, the airport will become the UK's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.
""The government says airport expansion is necessary for UK plc,"" says Lucy. ""We want to show that businesses are changing the way they stay connected and reducing their reliance on air travel.""

Businesses that have already signed up include Arkadin, BT, Capgemini, Marks & Spencer, Premiere Global Services, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Vodafone UK.

We're determined to prove the culture of business travel can be changed ­ and that companies will benefit from it. Decisions can be made much more quickly and productivity improved if someone can simply step into a videoconference room, rather than fly across the Atlantic. Members of the One in Five Challenge will form a supportive community, sharing ideas and learning from each other.


Aviation is one of the fastest-growing sources of emissions in the UK. It's currently responsible for 13% of the damage the UK does to the climate. WWF's One in Five Challenge helps companies cut their business flights by 20% over five years. This will save businesses money and reduce their impact on the environment.


People, planet, It's not every sausage that can claim to be protecting freshwater profit... and environments, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the lives of local communities. But a pigs new approach to pig farming in China is doing all this and more.

Pollution is a big problem in China's Central and Lower Yangtze regions. ""Most of the pollution is agricultural, and one of the most virulent forms is pig slurry,"" says Philip Leonard, who leads our work to restore wetlands and waterways here. ""Because the slurry is so full of nutrients, it causes huge algal blooms which suck all the oxygen out of the water. Everything dies, and the water is undrinkable.""

""It's a classic people-planet-profit
situation. These projects have a life of their own without the need for ongoing support from WWF.""
Philip Leonard

Pig farms also produce a lot of methane ­ a greenhouse gas 23 times more harmful than carbon dioxide. So when the Chinese government identified the region as a leading area for pig production, we decided to step in before a bad situation got worse.
We worked with a far-sighted local pig farmer to set up a model piggery that collects and treats its own slurry. The methane is harvested to provide heating fuel, while the sewage provides a powerful fertiliser. In solid form, it's sold at a profit. And the liquid is pumped for free to local farms. The remaining water is filtered until it's pure enough to return to the Yangtze.
Selling fertiliser and using methane for heating have helped make the farm economically viable. Local farmers have benefited from free fertiliser, and there's none of the usual pig farm stink.

""It's a classic people-planet-profit situation,"" says Philip. ""These tend to be the projects that have a life of their own without the need for ongoing support from WWF.""

We've been quick to communicate this success story to policy makers and industry representatives in China and beyond. Already, the provincial government is drafting a policy to replicate the model in many other farms.

This could play a huge role in restoring the wetlands and waterways of the Central and Lower Yangtze, while securing the livelihoods



of local people and improving their quality of life. Capturing the methane produced by China's 650 million pigs and reusing it as fuel will also have a significant impact in the fight against climate change.

By 2025, two thirds of the world's population are likely to suffer water shortageS


SINK OR SWIM How much longer can the planet's rivers and lakes give us the fresh water we need? Climate change, over-extraction and pollution have put many rivers in the UK and worldwide at crisis point. We need solutions. Fast.

Water is at the core of our existence. We drink it and wash with it. Billions of litres of it are used every day in farming and industry. Wildlife depends on it too.

Since 1970
populations of freshwater species
have fallen by more than a third

But our rivers and lakes are under unbearable pressure. We're taking more water than many rivers can support. We use many of the world's greatest rivers as drains for our pollution. And we're causing climate change, which increases the risk of both flooding and droughts.
The effects have already been disastrous. More than two billion people in over 40 countries endure water shortages. And since 1970, populations of freshwater species have shrunk by more than a third.

""The crisis will only deepen if things carry on like this,"" says Dr Dave Tickner, who heads WWF's freshwater programmes. ""That's why we're leading the way in protecting our rivers and lakes. In the UK and all around the world.""

1/3
a third of the uk's rivers are at
risk of severe environmental
damage

Unique habitat The UK and northern France are the only places on the planet where you'll find chalk streams. They're one of our most precious freshwater habitats. But also one of the most threatened.
The water vole, otter, kingfisher and trout all rely on them. So do many of our rarest plants, and insects such as the endangered southern damselfly. They're drawn to the steady flow of cool, clear water, rich in nutrients, which springs from the chalk. This also makes the streams an attractive source for public water supply. But as water levels drop, habitats are harmed.
""At their best, chalk streams are the most luscious, Arcadian rivers you could hope for,"" says TV presenter and chalk stream enthusiast, Charles Rangeley-Wilson. ""But when we take too much water from them, it's like cutting off the blood supply to every living thing that depends on it.""



Focus on fresh water

""WWF is making the link between the
water that comes from our taps and
the condition of the local natural
environment.""
Dave Tickner

A third of rivers in the UK ­ and over half in the south of England ­ are now at risk of severe environmental damage because we're taking too much water from them. A changing UK population is only making matters worse. And as the climate warms we may all use more water for showers and to water our gardens. It all means our rivers are on the edge of survival.
But there is hope. Rivers on the Edge, a project WWF launched this year with support from HSBC, is showing how rivers can come back from the brink.

We're working in a number of ways to reduce the amount of water extracted from three chalk streams in south-east England. By helping local people to waste less water. By working with water companies to introduce water efficiency schemes. And by getting together with government and regulators to ensure the right incentives are in place to use water more sustainably.

""We need to be wise with water to keep our rivers flowing for wildlife ­ it's that simple,"" says Dave Tickner. ""WWF is making the link between the water that comes from our taps and the condition of the local natural environment.""

58x Using less Our use of water in the UK isn't only affecting our own rivers. We're contributing to the international freshwater crisis too.

We consume about 30 times more in `virtual' water than in our domestic water use (that's enough
to fill 58 bathtubs)

How so? Every person in the UK uses about 150 litres of water a day for cooking, cleaning and drinking. But we consume about 30 times as much each day (that's enough to fill 58 bathtubs) in `virtual' water. Our food and clothes are the main culprits. And a lot of the production takes place in the developing world.
It's important to take all of this into account when calculating our total impact (or footprint) on rivers and lakes.
""It's also especially vital for companies that rely on a constant water supply to understand that water scarcity is a growing business risk,"" says Dave Tickner. ""If they do, they're far more likely to support WWF's efforts to safeguard rivers and lakes across the world.""

In the past year, we've teamed up with companies whose operations and supply chains use large amounts of water. For example, we helped Marks & Spencer and SABMiller to measure the water



footprints of certain products. This is an important first step towards assessing how much the companies rely on water from different river basins around the world. And thus the risk this poses not only to the companies but also to local communities and these freshwater ecosystems.

Next, we'll be working with these and other businesses to improve the way rivers are managed in areas we've identified as being at risk.

We're also focusing on water-guzzling crops in parts of the world where water is already scarce.

40-50%
less water used on
sugar crops

In India, for example, sugarcane takes up 4% of the land in Maharashtra state but uses 60% of the state's irrigation supply. Water here is used twice as fast as nature can replace it. So we're working here and elsewhere in the Indian sub-continent to reduce the amount of water and pesticides used in growing crops for sugar, cotton and rice.
The results are impressive. One of our initiatives, with support from the European Commission, reduced water use for sugar crops by 40-50%. And yields actually rose.

1/3
ONLY A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S 177 LARGE
RIVERS ARE FREE OF DAMS OR
OTHER BARRIERS

A world of good A lot of our work might focus on projects in a particular locality. But we don't forget the big picture. The decisions made nationally and internationally by politicians and businesses can help or hinder our work. So we do our best to influence them.
For example, this year we've helped the World Bank take more account of climate change and ecosystems in its water management work. We're also calling for the enforcement of a UN convention on rivers that flow through more than one country. This will help ensure that countries work together for the long-term health of a river, and not allow conflicts of interest to cloud their judgement.

""I've worked on freshwater issues at WWF for the past nine years,"" says Dave Tickner. ""The global crisis hasn't gone away. But we've achieved some remarkable results. We're now better placed than ever before to meet the challenges ahead.""




FARMERS AND Kenya's Lake Bogoria. Another country, another water crisis FLAMINGOS ­ and another chance for us to change the future for the better.
Thousands of people depend on the rivers and wetlands around Lake Bogoria for their drinking water, crops and livestock. In short, their survival. Endangered greater kudu, lesser and greater flamingo and black-necked grebe also rely on these waters. Up to two million birds can be found on the lake at any one time.

But an influx of people and more agriculture in recent years has reduced or stopped flows into the lake for months at a time. Silt is building up in its streams, and pollution is decreasing the quality.

""When WWF began working in this area,
there was regular conflict between
people ­ sometimes violent ­ over water
use. If we'd left this unchecked, it would have spelled disaster
for local people and wildlife.""
Daniel Koros

""When WWF began working in this area, there was regular conflict between people ­ sometimes violent ­ over water use. If we'd left this unchecked, it would have spelled disaster for local people and wildlife,"" says Daniel Koros from our Kenya office.
As well as helping to resolve conflicts, we've been tackling water scarcity here since 1996. Working with the Kenya water authority we're monitoring water use and preventing illegal use.
We've shown people at the upper reaches of the river why the flow has been affected. They're now determined to restore it.
We've helped farmers reduce the need for water and fertiliser by promoting use of a more efficient `drip' method of crop irrigation.
We've also helped to construct more than 600 `pan dams' so that farms can store rainwater and use it in the dry season to irrigate crops and water their livestock. These ponds are stocked with fish that allow people to boost their income.

""Today, people in the area appreciate that the way they use and manage their land and water has an impact on those living downstream, and on the lake,"" adds Daniel. ""They have the knowledge and desire to protect water and wildlife, not least because they now receive a share of the revenue generated by tourists coming to the Lake Bogoria National Reserve.""

This year Kenya suffered a severe drought. So it's a measure of our success that the River Waseges, which feeds the lake, flowed throughout the dry season for the first time in 10 years.



Algal blooms on Kenya's Lake Bogoria, caused by the use of agricultural fertilisers upstream, could kill off the food sources of birds such as these endangered lesser flamingos. Today, thanks to our input, people in the area have the knowledge and desire to protect both water and wildlife.

panda meets green dragon
This year we topped a survey of charitable organisations that leading UK companies turn to for environmental advice. So was there a meeting of minds when our chief executive David Nussbaum met entrepreneur Deborah Meaden?
You may well know Deborah as a panellist on Dragons' Den, the BBC's flagship show about investing in new business ideas. Perhaps less well known is that she's a WWF ambassador ­ giving her time freely to support our work. This includes exchanging ideas with our chief executive on the importance of business innovation in tackling the big environmental concerns of the day. And how we can engage with businesses and challenge them to change their practices. Here's what happened...
Watch a short film of this discussion at wwf.org.uk/deborahdavid

Discussion: business sustainability
David: We believe in working with business ­ it has a hugely important role if we're to solve the environmental and sustainability issues we face. Are there particular things you've seen that have moved the business agenda in relation to the environment?
Deborah: I've seen a considerable change over the last two or three years. There is more talk about the genuine impact the environment is having on business. We've got a moment in time here where business issues are completely aligned with environmental issues. Once you realise that this can help your profitability, it gets into the boardroom. Utopia to me would be ""of course we're green ­ it's crazy not to be"".
WWF has a huge remit, and can deal with longer-term issues. Are you finding that businesses are becoming more engaged when they understand this?
David: Oh absolutely. I think major forward-looking businesses are conscious they want to be in business not just this year but for the long term. That's why there's quite often an alignment between us and business because we can see that. It's similar for us: we've got to focus on immediate needs. But we've also got to make sure that there's a long-term future.
For me, it's summarised in four words: people and nature thrive. That's what we want. So we're looking for imaginative ways of creating economic and environmental sustainability for people and nature.
Deborah: I'm certainly beginning to see it. I'm seeing more genuinely innovative products than I think I've seen in the last 10 years. It feels to me like a moment of dawning. Are you experiencing a surge in technological innovation?
David: Yes. We see a lot of that, driven often by business because business is an engine of innovation. For example, we were looking at turtles being accidentally caught in fishing. Somebody came up with a fish hook shaped in a way that wouldn't catch turtles, so we provided some of these hooks free to fishermen. They got convinced. And then, there's a business opportunity for better fish hooks to be provided. So, finding innovative ways to solve problems that are a win for both sides has to be the right solution.


Deborah: The perception out there is still that WWF is just about the animals ­ the tiger, the panda. How are you going to overcome that?

Watch a short film of this discussion at wwf.org.uk/ deborahdavid

David: Partly we do it by making the links. We help people understand ­ if you want the animal, you need the habitat; if you want the habitat, we've got to protect it. So, for example, we've got to make sure the way business is getting its resources is really sustainable. I think smart business people have to be conscious that they are being entrusted with the world's resources.
Deborah: It ends up being quite a simple message: our world matters ­ what are we going to do about it?

WWF-UK tops business survey

This year, we were named leaders in a survey of charitable organisations that major UK companies turn to for environmental advice. We scored highly on `thought leadership', communication, awareness-building, advisory services, partnerships and investment in sustainability projects outside the UK. The survey was carried out by Verdantix ­ an independent research firm that specialises in commercial analysis of climate change, sustainability and energy issues.

WWF ambassadors

WWF ambassadors are distinguished and influential people who have significantly contributed to their profession or field of expertise, and who are committed to WWF's mission. We greatly appreciate their advice as well as their participation in and promotion of our work.

Sir David Attenborough, OM, CH, CVO, CBE, FRS, Richard Aylard, CVO, Simon Burall, The Hon James Buxton, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple, GCB, CBE, DL (Chairman), Will Day, John Elkington, Ben Fogle, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, Sir John Houghton CBE, FRS, The Rt Rev James Jones, DD, DL, Lord Bishop of Liverpool, Peter Jones, Clare Kerr, Sir Richard Kleinwort, Bt, Kevin McCloud, Alistair McGowan, Deborah Meaden, Sir Mervyn Pedelty (died 26 January 2010), Simon Pepper, OBE, Stephen Poliakoff, CBE, Jonathon Porritt, CBE, Lewis Gordon Pugh, Miranda Richardson, Professor Callum Roberts, Nick Ross.




year of the tiger
In the last century, tiger numbers have plummeted from 100,000 to as few as 3,200. Poaching, illegal trade and loss of habitat continue to cause huge problems. And the impacts of climate change are adding to the threat.
So we're launching a bold campaign in 2010 ­ the Chinese year of the tiger. Our target: to double wild tiger numbers by the next year of the tiger, in 2022.
We've been working on tiger conservation projects for many years, but the current critical situation means we need effective action on an even bigger scale. And we believe the right momentum is building across all 13 countries where wild tigers live.
""Never before has there been such an ambitious plan and high-level commitment from governments to double wild tiger numbers,"" says Diane Walkington, who heads our species work. ""If there's real commitment to help us protect the tigers' habitats and prevent poaching of tigers and their prey, we're confident that their numbers can recover quickly.""

Fundraising

Raising support We made good progress in raising funds, despite the challenges of an ongoing crisis in the world economy. We've spent more, but it's paying off. More than double the number of new supporters joined us this year than in the previous 12 months. We now have 266,000 people giving us a regular gift ­ the highest figure we've achieved to date. Their ongoing support is invaluable and greatly appreciated.

We've come up with lots of different ways to engage supporters and boost our income. Fundraising through the internet and social media has gone well, as have our new direct response television adverts. And we've seen increases in the numbers of people giving us other forms of support ­ particularly online campaigners. Politicians listen when they receive thousands of emails asking for action on a particular issue. So, for example, the 105,000 people who signed up online to support WWF's Earth Hour 2009 ensured it had an even greater impact.


A lasting legacy

to ­ but we shall save a great deal more than if we had
never tried.""
Sir Peter Scott

It's hard to imagine a life better spent. He was passionate about nature and conservation, and deeply concerned about the planet's ability to withstand human demands on its resources. Another of his driving interests was preserving the Antarctic wilderness from human exploitation. Hardly surprising: his father was the legendary

Robert Falcon Scott ­ Scott of the Antarctic.

Sir Peter Scott was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Society and created a Companion of Honour by the Queen in 1987. He died two years later at the age of 79.

His legacy lives on, through WWF's numerous worldwide programmes.

If the story of Sir Peter Scott inspires you, perhaps you would consider leaving a legacy of your own. You can help protect the future of our world with a gift in your will to WWF, the organisation he cofounded nearly half a century ago. You'll help us tackle issues such as climate change, protect endangered habitats and safeguard the future of animals on the verge of extinction.

As Sir Peter himself said: ""We shan't save all we should like to ­ but we shall save a great deal more than if we had never tried.""

We would like to pay tribute to everyone who remembered us in their wills, and to friends and relatives who made memorial donations. Every legacy is of great value to our work. The following people left especially generous bequests during the year:
Miss I Aird, Miss SJ Baines, Mr GA Baxter, Miss DL Blay, Miss L Broomhead, Mrs EM Burr, Miss HA Chatterton, Mr PM Durman, Miss BJ Epton, Miss AC Gill, Dr CJ Hemming, Mr AS James, Mr RA Jeffery, Miss AM Knights, Miss BP Lincoln, Miss JK Miller, Mrs JM Pemberton, Mrs M-A Shanks, Mrs OJ Sherwood, Mrs D Skidmore, Mr N Skidmore, Mr H Snape, Mr RFA Spooner, Mr M Surtees, Miss T Thomas.



inspiring by Cutting our air travel. Burning wood pellets to keep us warm. example Reducing our use of paper. It's not glamorous. But all of it helps us reduce our own environmental impact as much as we can.

94%

As our annual review shows, we address threats to the planet in many ways. Lobbying governments to tackle issues such as climate change and illegal logging. Pressing business to cut flights, avoid dirty fuels, and assess and reduce their water footprints. And encouraging local communities in the developing world to help safeguard habitats and wildlife.

94% of the wood and paper products we
used were from Forest Stewardship Council certified recycled post-consumer waste

But we're well aware we have our own impact on the environment. So we're doing our utmost to reduce this to an absolute minimum.
As an organisation that works all over the world, inevitably we have to get on planes to support our field programmes or to lobby at important international meetings. But we also recognise that, like many other organisations, we need to reduce our air travel. So we've joined our own One in Five Challenge (see page 36) to cut one in five of our flights within five years.

We've also imposed tough targets on ourselves to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions from travel. Our commitment was to cut emissions by 5% this year and in each of the coming years. We've got off to a flying start ­ achieving a 26% reduction in emissions from air travel compared with the previous year, thanks to the commitment of our staff. They now use the train for most UK and close European destinations, and our web-based conferencing system has proved very popular.

We've managed to cut our energy use by 5%, thanks to unglamorous but effective changes such as installing new eco hand-driers and using clever technology that ensures our electrical equipment consumes less energy and runs more efficiently. And at our Scotland office we cut our gas use by 90% thanks to a new boiler fuelled by wood pellets.

We've also reduced the amount of paper we use in the office by 30%. This was due in part to new software that means staff can only print documents when they go to the printer.



We regard carbon offsetting as a last resort ­ only after reducing, reusing and recycling. But for the fourth year running, we've offset our unavoidable emissions by investing in gold standard carbon offset schemes.
We hope that by challenging ourselves in these and many other ways, we'll be even better placed to inspire others to make positive changes to their ways of life.

positive change
For three decades, our iconic collection boxes helped to make the panda the instantly recognisable face of conservation. And they've collected huge amounts of small change. Just one of many ways countless people have shown us their ongoing support.
We rely on such generosity to continue our work. Each and every penny you donate helps us to achieve positive changes, such as those featured in this review. Thank you.
Our collection boxes were retired in 2007. But this year we challenged 16 British artists, including Sir Peter Blake, Jason Bruges, Tracey Emin, Jim Lambie and Sir Paul Smith, to reinvent the pandas. An auction of the artworks, which we exhibited in Selfridges, London, raised nearly £100,000 to support our work.

reduce these impacts. We produce this report annually as part of our commitment to our environmental policy. It's reviewed by our internal audit team and endorsed by our management team and trustees prior to publication.
This report outlines our environmental performance from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2010. To minimise the environmental and financial costs associated with printing, our Environmental Report is only available online.
If you have any comments about this report, or suggestions on how we could improve

our environmental reporting, please e-mail our environmental management team at

ems@wwf.org.uk.

Overview
WWF-UK operates out of five locations in the UK. More than 80% of our staff are based at our headquarters in Godalming, Surrey. In Scotland, our office is in Dunkeld. We also rent office space in Belfast, Cardiff and London.
The average number of WWF-UK employees, calculated on a full-time basis, during this reporting period was 288. In the previous year the figure was 3061.

ISO 14001 We first achieved accreditation to ISO 14001 in 2008, and were re-certified in June 2010. ISO 14001 is an internationally-recognised environmental standard. It requires organisations to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

Overall Results
We made good improvements to our overall environmental performance this year. We cut our total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from business travel and energy use by 37 tonnes, to 614 tonnes. That's a 5.7% reduction on last year's total.


Energy
We're committed to minimising our CO2 emissions from electricity and gas use. We met our target for reducing electricity use, but unfortunately not our target for gas use.
Electricity
During this reporting period, we switched off two of five air-conditioning units in the computer server rooms in our UK headquarters. On the remaining three air-conditioning units, we've turned up the thermostat from 18°C to 23°C. This reduces the amount of time they're needed to cool the room. We've also switched off two servers. It's all helped us make savings in our electricity consumption.
This year the electricity consumption from our UK headquarters and our Scotland and Northern Ireland offices was equivalent to 163 tonnes of CO2. This is a reduction of 5.8% on last year's figure of 173 tonnes. So we met our target to cut our electricity use by 5%. Our FY11 target is to reduce the carbon emissions from our electricity use by 5% from FY10 levels.


We included gas use from our Belfast office (3 tonnes of CO2) for the first time this year. This, combined with the failure of the boilers in our UK headquarters to function efficiently during the prolonged period of particularly low temperatures over the winter, led to our failure to meet our target ­ to return to our FY08 level of gas use.

Our total gas use from our UK headquarters and our offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland was equivalent to 105 tonnes of CO2. We've set the same reduction target again for FY11. By ensuring the boilers are in optimum working condition and the thermostats are adjusted depending on outside temperatures, we aim to cut our CO2 emissions from gas use to 76 tonnes or less.



Biomass
In June 2008, our Scotland office installed a wood-chip boiler. We burn FSC woodchip pellets produced by a local company to heat the office and provide hot water. During FY10, we burned 11 tonnes of wood pellets ­ the same amount as in the previous year. This is equivalent to 2 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Our target for FY11 is to keep to this level of wood pellet consumption, which avoids the use of gas in our office in Scotland.

This year we've updated our conversion factor to calculate CO2 emissions from burning wood-chip pellets. In August 2010, Defra published new guideline figures which state that burning 1 tonne of wood pellets produces 183.93kg CO2.


Water
We've cut water consumption at our head office this year. The installation of waterreducing devices in all cisterns at the end of last year has continued to cut water consumption in WCs by up to 33%. As a result, we met our target to reduce per capita use to our FY08 level. Our water use figures are based on quarterly billing, with actual readings being provided in August of each year. We've now changed our monitoring ­ from now on we'll take monthly meter readings to get a better understanding of our water consumption. Our target for FY11 is to keep to this level of water consumption.


tRAVEL
As an international organisation, it's important that we visit our overseas projects to monitor progress and provide leadership and advice. We attend international meetings to lobby, and to collaborate with our colleagues worldwide.
In 2003, we identified that business travel caused our greatest impact on the environment. So we set a target to cut our CO2 emissions from business travel by 25% over six years from the baseline year of FY04. We've managed to meet this target. We've done it by giving teams of staff carbon budgets for travel. We've actively promoted travel by rail rather than by air to European destinations. And we've provided web, audio and videoconferencing alternatives. Since the baseline year of FY04, we've reduced our business travel emissions by 34%.

*This year we've updated our conversion factor to calculate CO2 emissions from road and rail transport in line with latest Defra guidelines, published in October 2009. Had we stayed consistent with previous conversion factors, we'd have been able to report an even greater reduction in CO2.

Our business travel includes journeys by air, road and rail. Figure 5 shows the split between our emissions from these different forms of transport in FY10. Air travel remains the main source of our business travel emissions.

WWF One in Five Challenge This year we joined the One in Five Challenge, WWF's guided programme and award scheme that helps companies and government cut 20% of their business flights within five years. We set FY08 as our baseline year and within 12 months had met the target ­ achieving a 32% cut in flight numbers. More information about the Challenge can be found at wwf.org.uk/oneinfive Our target for FY11 is to maintain business travel emissions at FY10 levels. We're anticipating an increase in our business activity over the coming years, we're reviewing how we factor in business growth when setting future targets.

WWF-UK's Environmental Report

Web, Audio And Videoconferencing
In January 2010 we installed a new Polycom videoconferencing system. It uses highdefinition cameras and internet technology. We have a unit in our UK headquarters, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, and we'll be installing a unit at our London office later this year.
We continue to use our web-based conferencing system, Webex, as well as audioconferencing, as alternatives to face-to-face meetings. Using these technologies helps us to reduce our CO2 emissions from travel. It also saves us significant costs from avoided travel and hotel expenses, and reduces the amount of time our staff spend travelling to meetings. Furthermore, it means our staff spend less time away from their families and friends, which improves the work-life balance of employees.

Our new wormery has helped us send 4% less
waste to landfill compared to last year

Waste And Recycling
Waste from our UK headquarters is reported in litres this year, as the contractors that remove our landfill and recycling have not supplied us with weight data. Table 2 shows that we reduced our waste going to landfill by 4%. However, we failed to meet our ambitious target of reducing by 20% the amount of waste we send to landfill. During FY11 we aim to reduce the volume of waste we send to landfill by 10% against FY10 figures.
In an effort to reduce the amount of waste we send to landfill, we've introduced compost caddies at all tea points at our UK headquarters and our Scottish office. These are emptied into wormery units on site or are composted.
We were able to reduce the amount of paper we sent for recycling, because we've reduced our paper purchasing.

Procurement
We have a number of purchasing policies and guidelines for printing, paper and timber products, and guidelines for organising WWF events to ensure our products and activities have a minimal impact on the environment.
We ask our new suppliers to complete an environmental and ethical questionnaire so we can assess their environmental performance. Products in our gift catalogue are evaluated using an extended environmental and ethical questionnaire, which enables us to get a clear understanding of the raw materials used, the manufacturing process and manufacturing location, and the packaging. In the course of the year, we reviewed and updated our environmental and ethical questionnaire. It now also considers how products can be reused or recycled.



Using a company to manage our
print materials and replacing paper towels
with Bio-dryers in our washrooms have meant
we've reduced the amount of paper we use
by 38% this year

Timber and paper products
We're committed to the responsible purchasing of forest products. Our intention is to source all the forest products that we purchase from well-managed forests that have been certified to credible certification standards, or that are 100% recycled.
The Global Forest & Trade Network is a partnership led by WWF. It links more than 360 companies in over 30 countries to improve the management of the world's production forests and create a new market for environmentallyresponsible forest products. Some 40 companies participate in the GFTN-UK. They work to identify and avoid timber and paper supplies that come from unknown or unacceptable sources, and move instead towards products from credibly-certified forests.
WWF-UK follows the membership requirements of the GFTN-UK. We report by calendar year the type and weight of timber and paper products we purchase. Products which cannot be traced to their source or are identified or suspected as not being accepted by the responsible purchasing policy are referred to as Category 1. Last year we set a target to reduce our consumption of timber and paper products in 2009, and to eliminate Category 1 products. The figures in Table 4 show that we purchased a small amount of Category 1 products during 2009. It's our continued intention to eliminate Category 1 products.
During 2008, we started to use a print management company to manage our printing output effectively, to ensure compliance with our paper and printing policies, and to reduce printing costs. This move has helped us to reduce our consumption of timber and paper products by 38%.

5 years
For the fifth year running, we've offset
our unavoidable emissions by investing
in gold standard carbon offset schemes

Carbon Offsets
This report outlines our energy use and consumption, as well as the ways in which we strive to reduce our carbon emissions to the irreducible minimum. We believe it's important to take all these measures to reduce our emissions before resorting to offsetting carbon.
This is the fifth year that WWF-UK has offset carbon emissions from our electricity and gas use and from our road, rail and air travel. We've purchased Gold Standard offsets from Climatefriendly, the WWF network's chosen supplier for offsetting. This year, our funds will be used to support a landfill gas recovery project in Jiangshu Province, China.

FOREWORD
The protection of biodiversity and ecosystems must be a priority in our quest to build a stronger, fairer and cleaner world economy. Rather than an excuse to delay further action, the recent financial and economic crisis should serve as a reminder of the urgency of developing greener economies. Both WWF and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are contributing to this goal.
The Living Planet Report is helping raise public awareness of the pressures on the biosphere and spreading the message that ""business as usual"" is not an option. The report contributes to fostering action, as what gets measured gets managed.
The OECD is developing a Green Growth Strategy to help governments design and implement policies that can shift our economies onto greener growth paths. Central to this is identifying sources of growth which make much lighter claims on the biosphere. This will require fundamental changes to the structure of our economies, by creating new green industries, cleaning up polluting sectors and transforming consumption patterns. An important element will be educating and motivating people to adjust their lifestyles, so we can leave a healthier planet to future generations.
Policy makers and citizens need reliable information on the state of the planet, combining various aspects without getting lost in the details. Although the Living Planet Report indices share the methodological challenges that all aggregated environmental indices face, their merit is their ability to convey simple messages about complex issues. They can reach out to people and hopefully influence behaviour change among audiences that may otherwise receive little environmental information.
I commend WWF for its efforts. The OECD will continue to work to further refine green growth indicators and improve the way in which we measure progress.
Angel Gurría Secretary General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

Focusing on the future
The Living Planet Report relates the Living Planet Index ­ a measure of the health of the world's biodiversity ­ to the Ecological Footprint and the Water Footprint ­ measures of humanity's demands on the Earth's natural resources.
These indicators clearly demonstrate that the unprecedented drive for wealth and well-being of the past 40 years is putting unsustainable pressures on our planet. The Ecological Footprint shows a doubling of our demands on the natural world since the 1960s, while the Living Planet Index tracks a fall of 30 per cent in the health of species that are the foundation of the ecosystem services on which we all depend.
Rapid economic growth has fuelled an ever-growing demand for resources ­ for food and drink, energy, transport, electronic products, living space, and space to dispose of wastes, particularly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. As these resources can no longer be sourced from within national boundaries, they are increasingly being sought from other parts of the world. The effects are clearly visible in the Living Planet Indices for the tropical world and for the world's poorer countries -- both of which have fallen by 60 per cent since 1970.
The implications are clear. Rich nations must find ways to live much more lightly on the Earth ­ to sharply reduce their footprint, including in particular their reliance on fossil fuels. The rapidly-growing emerging economies must also find a new model for growth ­ one that allows them to continue to improve the wellbeing of their citizens in ways that the Earth can actually sustain.
For all of us, these figures raise fundamental questions of how we can adapt our ways of living and definitions of development to include the imperatives of nurturing the world's natural resources, living within their regenerative capacity and appreciating the true value of the goods and services they provide.
The economic crisis of the past two years has provided an opportunity to reassess fundamental attitudes to the use of the world's natural resources. There are some green shoots of change.


The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative is drawing attention to the global economic benefits of biodiversity, highlighting the growing costs of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), WWF and others are working hard to promote the green economy. An increasing number of fishers; timber, soy and palm-oil producers; and some of the world's largest companies are working to put their activities onto a sustainable footing. And one billion people, across 128 countries, demonstrated their support for change by joining in Earth Hour 2010.
There are many challenges ahead ­ not least meeting the needs of an increasing world population. These challenges further emphasize the importance of decoupling development from growing demands on the natural resources. Put plainly, we have to devise ways of getting as much, and more, from much less. Continuing to consume the Earth's resources more quickly than they can be replenished is destroying the very systems on which we depend. We have to move to managing resources on nature's terms and on nature's scale. James P. Leape Director General WWF International


Executive summary

2010 -- The International Year of Biodiversity -- The year in which new species continue to be found, but
more tigers live in captivity than in the wild -- The year in which 34 per cent of Asia-Pacific CEOs and 53
per cent of Latin American CEOs expressed concern about the impacts of biodiversity loss on their business growth prospects, compared to just 18 per cent of Western European CEOs (PwC, 2010) -- The year in which there are 1.8 billion people using the internet, but 1 billion people still without access to an adequate supply of freshwater

This year, biodiversity is in the spotlight as never before. As is human development, with an upcoming review of the Millennium Development Goals. This makes WWF's 8th edition of the Living Planet Report particularly timely. Using an expanded set of complementary indicators, the report documents the changing state of biodiversity, ecosystems and humanity's consumption of natural


resources, and explores the implications of these changes for future

human health, wealth and well-being.

A wide range of indicators are now being used to track the

state of biodiversity, the pressures upon it, and the steps being taken

to address those trends (Butchart, S.H.M. et al., 2010; CBD, 2010).

One of the longest-running measures of the trends in the state of

global biodiversity, the Living Planet Index (LPI) shows a consistent

overall trend since the first Living Planet Report was published

in 1998: a global decline of almost 30 per cent between 1970 and

2007 (Figure 1). Trends regarding tropical and temperate species'

populations are starkly divergent: the tropical LPI has declined by

60 per cent while the temperate LPI has increased by almost 30

per cent. The reason behind these contrasting trends likely reflects

differences between the rates and timing of land-use changes, and

hence habitat loss, in tropical and temperate zones. The increase in

the temperate LPI since 1970 may be due to the fact that it is starting

from a lower baseline, and that species' populations are recovering

following improvements in pollution control and waste management,

better air and water quality, an increase in forest cover, and/or

greater conservation efforts in at least some temperate regions.



In contrast, the tropical LPI likely starts from a higher baseline and reflects the large-scale ecosystem changes that have continued in tropical regions since the start of the index in 1970, which overall outweigh any positive conservation impacts.

The Ecological Footprint tracks the area of biologically productive land and water required to provide the renewable resources people use, and includes the space needed for infrastructure and vegetation to absorb waste carbon dioxide (CO2). It also shows a consistent trend: one of continuous growth (Figure 2). In 2007, the most recent year for which data is available, the Footprint exceeded the Earth's biocapacity -- the area actually available to produce renewable resources and absorb CO2 -- by 50 per cent. Overall, humanity's Ecological Footprint has doubled since 1966. This growth in ecological overshoot is largely attributable to the carbon footprint, which has increased 11-fold since 1961 and by just over one-third since the publication of the first Living Planet Report in 1998. However, not everybody has an equal footprint and there are enormous differences between countries, particularly those at different economic levels and levels of development. Therefore, for the first time, this edition of the Living Planet Report looks at how the Ecological Footprint has changed over time in different political regions, both in magnitude and relative contribution of each footprint component.
The Water Footprint of Production provides a second measure of human demand on renewable resources, and shows that 71 countries are currently experiencing some stress on blue water sources -- that is, sources of water people use and don't return -- with nearly two-thirds of these experiencing moderate to severe stress. This has profound implications for ecosystem health, food production and human well-being, and is likely to be exacerbated by climate change.
The LPI, Ecological Footprint and Water Footprint of Production monitor changes in ecosystem health and human demand on ecosystems, but do not provide any information on the state of ecosystem services -- the benefits that people get from ecosystems and upon which all human activities depend. For the first time, this edition of the Living Planet Report includes two of the best-developed indicators for ecosystem services at a global level: terrestrial carbon storage and freshwater provision. While such indicators require further development and refinement, they nevertheless help make it clear that conserving nature is in humanity's own interest, not to mention that of biodiversity itself.
As in previous reports, the relationship between development and the Ecological Footprint is examined, and minimum criteria for sustainability are defined based on available biocapacity and the Human Development Index. This analysis indicates that it is

in fact possible for countries to meet these criteria, although major challenges remain for all countries to meet them.
For the first time this report also looks at trends in biodiversity by country income, which highlights an alarming rate of biodiversity loss in low-income countries. This has serious implications for people in these countries: although all people depend on ecosystem services for their well-being, the impact of environmental degradation is felt most directly by the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Without access to clean water, land and adequate food, fuel and materials, vulnerable people cannot break out of the poverty trap and prosper.
Ending ecological overshoot is essential in order to ensure the continued supply of ecosystem services and thus future human health, wealth and well-being. Using a new Footprint Scenario Calculator developed by the Global Footprint Network (GFN), this report presents various future scenarios based on different variables related to resource consumption, land use and productivity. Under a ""business as usual"" scenario, the outlook is serious: even with modest UN projections for population growth, consumption and climate change, by 2030 humanity will need the capacity of two Earths to absorb CO2 waste and keep up with natural resource consumption. Alternative scenarios based on different food consumption patterns and energy mixes illustrate immediate actions that could close the gap between Ecological Footprint and biocapacity -- and also some of the dilemmas and decisions these entail.
The information presented in this report is only the beginning. In order to secure the future in all its complexity for generations to come, governments, businesses and individuals urgently need to translate these facts and figures into actions and policies -- as well as anticipate both future opportunities and obstacles in the path to sustainability. Only by recognizing the central role that nature plays in human health and wellbeing will we protect the ecosystems and species on which we all depend.



Introduction
The magnificent variety of life on Earth is a true wonder. This biodiversity also allows people to live, and to live well.
Plants, animals and microorganisms form complex, interconnected webs of ecosystems and habitats, which in turn supply a myriad of ecosystem services upon which all life depends (see Box: Ecosystem services). Although technology can replace some of these services and buffer against their degradation, many cannot be replaced.
Ecosystem services Ecosystem services are the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). They include: -- Provisioning services: goods obtained directly from
ecosystems (e.g. food, medicine, timber, fibre, biofuel) -- Regulating services: benefits obtained from the
regulation of natural processes (e.g. water filtration, waste decomposition, climate regulation, crop pollination, regulation of some human diseases) -- Supporting services: regulation of basic ecological functions and processes that are necessary for the provision of all other ecosystem services (e.g. nutrient cycling, photosynthesis, soil formation) -- Cultural services: psychological and emotional benefits gained from human relations with ecosystems (e.g. enriching recreational, aesthetic and spiritual experiences)


Understanding the interactions outlined in Figure 3 is fundamental to conserving biodiversity and ecosystem health and so safeguarding the future security, health and well-being of human societies.


All human activities make use of ecosystem services -- but can also put pressure on the biodiversity that supports these services (Figure 3). The five greatest direct pressures are:
-- Habitat loss, alteration, and fragmentation: mainly through conversion of land for agricultural, aquaculture, industrial or urban use; damming and other changes to river systems for irrigation, hydropower or flow regulation; and damaging fishing activities
-- Over-exploitation of wild species populations: harvesting of animals and plants for food, materials or medicine at a rate above the reproductive capacity of the population
-- Pollution: mainly from excessive pesticide use in agriculture and aquaculture; urban and industrial effluents; mining waste; and excessive fertilizer use in agriculture
-- Climate change: due to rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, caused mainly by the burning of fossil fuels, forest clearing and industrial processes
-- Invasive species: introduced deliberately or inadvertently to one part of the world from another; they then become competitors, predators or parasites of native species

In large part, these threats stem from human demands for food, drink, energy and materials, as well as the need for space for towns, cities and infrastructure. These demands are largely met by a few key sectors: agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining, industry, water and energy. Together, these sectors form the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss. The scale of their impact on biodiversity depends on three factors: the total number of consumers, or population; the amount each person is consuming; and the efficiency with which natural resources are converted into goods and services.
Biodiversity loss can cause ecosystems to become stressed or degraded, and even eventually to collapse. This threatens the continued provision of ecosystem services, which in turn further threatens biodiversity and ecosystem health. Crucially, the dependency of human society on ecosystem services makes the loss of these services a serious threat to the future well-being and development of all people, all around the world.



Protected areas and ecosystem services
Protected areas play a vital role in ensuring that ecosystems continue to function and provide ecosystem services, benefiting communities within the boundaries of the protected area, in adjacent ecosystems and around the world. For example, marine protected areas can safeguard a nutritious food supply for local communities by ensuring the sustainability of fisheries. Terrestrial protected areas can ensure a regular supply of clean water downstream.
To fully safeguard the biodiversity that supports ecosystem services, an ecologically coherent network of protected and sustainable-use areas needs to be established around the globe. One of the main characteristics of an ecological network is that it aims to establish and maintain the environmental conditions necessary for the long-term conservation of biodiversity via four functions:
-- Safeguarding assemblages of habitat large enough, and of sufficient quality, to support species' populations within core areas
-- Providing opportunities for movement between these reserves via corridors
-- Protecting the network from potentially damaging activities and the effects of climate change through buffer zones
-- Promoting sustainable forms of land use within sustainable-use areas
The integration of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use is therefore one of the defining features of establishing and maintaining ecological networks. One example of an ecological network is the Vilcabamba-Amboro Conservation Corridor in Peru and Ecuador, where support is being given to low-impact economic enterprises, sustainable hunting practices and the development of ecotourism. Similarly, in the Terai Arc Landscape in the Eastern Himalayas, education courses and subsidies for the construction of livestock pens have been provided for livestock herders, together with improved fuel-efficient cooking stoves and biogas plants.
Ecological networks can also help adaptation to climate change by reducing ecological fragmentation and improving the ecological quality of multiple-use areas. Examples include the Gondwana Link in southwest Australia and the Yellowstone-toYukon ecoregion.


CROP POLLINATION:
Forest pollinators increase coffee yields by 20%, and improve coffee quality by 27%, on Costa Rican coffee farms located within 1km of forest

SPIRITUAL VALUES:
Particular groves and trees within the forests of southeast Cameroon have substantial spiritual value to the Baka (pygmy) people

WATER PROVISION:
More than 80% of the water for Ecuador's capital, Quito, originates in three protected areas

1

Costa Rica Forest pollinators increase coffee yields by 20 per cent, and improve

coffee quality by 27 per cent, on Costa Rican coffee farms located

within one kilometre of forest (Ricketts et al., 2004). Pollination

services from two forest areas translated into income of US$60,000

per year for one Costa Rican farm -- a value commensurate with

expected revenues from competing land uses (Ricketts et al., 2004).

Globally, approximately 75 per cent of the world's top 100 crops rely

on natural pollinators. There is growing evidence that more diverse

pollinator communities result in higher, and more stable, pollination

services; however, agricultural intensification and forest loss can

harm pollinator species (Klein et al., 2007).

2

Ecuador

More than 80 per cent of the water for Ecuador's capital, Quito,

originates in three protected areas (Goldman, 2009). Several of these

protected areas, including the three around Quito (Goldman et al.,

2010), are threatened by human activities, including construction

of water supply infrastructure, land conversion by farmers and

ranchers, and logging. Overall, about one-third of the world's 105

largest cities obtain a significant proportion of their drinking water

directly from protected areas (Dudley and Stolton, 2003).

3

Cameroon Particular groves and trees within the forests of southeast

Cameroon have substantial spiritual value to the Baka (pygmy)

people. The Baka follow a complex faith system that includes the

adoption of a personal god in adolescence and the veneration of

particular sites -- groves and trees -- within the forest. It is against

their beliefs to allow anyone else to enter a sacred area, which also

helps to protect wildlife in such areas (Stolton et al., 2002).

4

Norway A compound from a soil microorganism isolated in Norway is used

to prevent organ rejection following transplantation (Laird et al.,

2003). This compound is used to produce Sandimmun, which by

2000 was one of world's top-selling drugs.

Over half of current synthetic medical compounds originate

from natural precursors, including well-known drugs like aspirin,

digitalis and quinine. Natural compounds from animals, plants

and microorganisms continue to play an important role in the

development of new drugs for treating human diseases (WHO, 2005; Newman et al., 2003).

5

Sri Lanka Sri Lanka's Muthurajawela Marsh provides a range of freshwater

services, including industrial wastewater and domestic sewage

treatment. Other services provided by the marsh include flood

attenuation, firewood provision, leisure and recreation, and

freshwater provision, which have been valued at an estimated

US$7.5 million each year (WWF, 2004). Other wetlands provide

similar services, but, since 1900, more than half of the world's

wetlands have disappeared (Barbier, 1993).

6

Indonesia The peatlands of Riau province, Sumatra, are estimated to store

14.6 gigatons (Gt) of carbon -- the largest amount of carbon in

Indonesia (Yumiko et al., 2008). Peat soils are able to store 30 times

more carbon than the tropical forests above them; however, this

storage capacity depends on the health of these forests. Over the

last 25 years, Riau has lost four million hectares (65 per cent)

of its forest. Much of this was driven by industrial oil palm and

pulpwood plantations. Between 1990 and 2007, total emissions

from land-use change in Riau reached 3.66 Gt of CO2. This exceeds

the annual total CO2 emissions of the entire European Union for

the year 2005.

7

Indonesia Communities living near intact forest have significantly fewer cases

of malaria and dysentery than communities without intact forests

nearby (Pattanayak, 2003). Deforestation has been linked to an

increased abundance or range of mosquito populations or species,

and/or life-cycle changes that improve their capacity as a malaria

vector, not only in Asia but also in Africa (Afrane et al., 2005, 2006

and 2007). Worldwide, there are an estimated 247 million cases

of malaria per year, which cause some 880,000 deaths, mostly

of African children (WHO, 2008). With no truly reliable cure yet

available, the best way to avoid the disease is to avoid being bitten

by infected mosquitoes.

Chapter one: The state of the planet~
The Living Planet Report uses a series of indicators to monitor biodiversity, human demand on renewable resources and ecosystem services. The Living Planet Index reflects changes in the health of the planet's ecosystems by tracking trends in populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians. The Ecological Footprint tracks human demand on ecosystems by measuring the area of biologically productive land and water required to provide the renewable resources people use and to absorb the CO2 waste that human activities generate. The Water Footprint of Production measures water use in different countries. Maps of ecosystem services provide information about their location and use, and permit analysis of where they have the most value or where their degradation would affect the most people.

Monitoring biodiversity: The Living Planet Index

The Living Planet Index (LPI) reflects changes in the health of the planet's ecosystems by tracking trends in nearly 8,000 populations of vertebrate species. Much as a stock market index tracks the value of a set of shares over time as the sum of its daily change, the LPI first calculates the annual rate of change for each species population in the dataset (example populations are shown in Figure 5). The index then calculates the average change across all populations for each year from 1970, when data collection began, to 2007, the latest date for which data is available (Collen, B. et al., 2009. See the Appendix for more details).

Living Planet Index: Global The latest global LPI shows a decline of about 30 per cent between 1970 and 2007 (Figure 4). This is based on trends in 7,953 populations of 2,544 mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and fish species (Appendix Table 1) -- many more than in previous Living Planet Reports (WWF, 2006b; 2008d).


Living Planet Index: Tropical and temperate
The global Living Planet Index is the aggregate of two indices -- the temperate LPI (which includes polar species) and the tropical LPI -- each of which is given equal weight. The tropical index consists of terrestrial and freshwater species' populations found in the Afrotropical, Indo-Pacific and Neotropical realms, as well as

60%
decline in the tropical LPI

marine species' populations from the zone between the Tropics of

Cancer and Capricorn. The temperate index includes terrestrial and

freshwater species' populations from the Palearctic and Nearctic

realms, as well as marine species' populations found north or south

of the tropics. In each of these two indices, overall trends between

terrestrial, freshwater and marine species' populations are given

equal weight.

Tropical and temperate species' populations show starkly different trends: the tropical LPI has declined by around 60 per

29%

cent in less than 40 years, while the temperate LPI has increased by 29 per cent over the same period (Figure 6). This difference is apparent for mammals, birds, amphibians and fish, for terrestrial, marine and freshwater species (Figures 7­9), and across all tropical

and temperate biogeographic realms (Figures 10--14). However,

this does not necessarily imply that temperate ecosystems are in a

better state than tropical ecosystems. If the temperate index were

to extend back centuries rather than decades it would very probably

show a long-term decline at least as great as that shown by tropical

ecosystems in recent times, whereas a long-term tropical index

would be likely to show a much slower rate change prior to 1970.

There is insufficient pre-1970 data to calculate historic changes

accurately, so all LPIs are arbitrarily set to equal one in 1970.

Why are tropical and temperate trends so different?
The most likely explanation is the difference between the rates and timing of land-use changes in tropical and temperate zones, and hence the associated rates and timing of habitat destruction and degradation -- the major cause of biodiversity loss in recent times (MEA, 2005a). For example, more than half the estimated original extent of temperate broadleaf forests had already been converted to agriculture, forest plantations and urban areas prior to 1950 (MEA, 2005a). In contrast, deforestation and land-use change only accelerated in the tropics after 1950 (MEA, 2005a). Data on trends in habitat extent is not available for all habitat types, but the picture for tropical and temperate forests is probably indicative of trends



in other habitat types, including freshwater, coastal and marine

habitats. It is therefore likely that many temperate species felt the

impact of agricultural expansion and industrialization long before

the beginning of the index in 1970, and so the temperate LPI starts

from an already reduced baseline. The increase since 1970 may

be due to species' populations recovering following improvements

Figure 6: The Temperate in pollution control and waste management, better air and water

LPI & the Tropical LPI quality, an increase in forest cover and/or greater conservation

The temperate index shows an increase of 29% between

efforts in at least some temperate regions (see biogeographic

1970 and 2007

realms, page 30). In contrast, the tropical LPI likely starts from

The tropical index shows a higher baseline and reflects the large-scale ecosystem changes

a decline of more than 60% between 1970 and 2007

that have continued in tropical regions since the start of the index



in 1970, which overall outweigh any positive conservation impacts.

The Marine Living Planet Index tracks changes in 2,023 populations of 636 species of fish, seabirds, marine turtles and marine mammals found in temperate and tropical marine ecosystems (Appendix table 2). Approximately half the species in this index are commercially used. Overall the marine LPI has declined by 24 per cent (Figure 8a). Marine ecosystems show the largest discrepancy between tropical and temperate species: the tropical marine LPI has declined by around 60 per cent while the temperate marine LPI has increased by around 50 per cent (Figure 8b). However, there is evidence that massive long-term declines occurred in temperate marine and coastal species over the past few centuries (Lotze, H.K. et al., 2006; Thurstan, R.H. et al., 2010), and therefore the temperate index was starting from a much lower baseline in 1970 than the tropical index.

Papua New Guinea: A dry river basin in the East Sepik province where WWF is supporting the establishment of protected areas, the sustainable harvest of freshwater and forest products, and the development of ecotourism, healthcare and community education. We are developing a model for river basin management across New Guinea, which will protect important freshwater and forest resources that offer habitat for threatened species such as the harpy eagle and cassowary, as well as providing subsistence livelihoods for local communities.
Living Planet Index: Biogeographic realms
Analyzing the LPI at the sub-global or regional level can help to identify biodiversity threats in particular areas. To ensure that such analyses are biologically meaningful, the terrestrial and freshwater species' populations in the LPI database were divided into five biogeographic realms (Map 2), three of which are largely tropical (Indo-Pacific, Afrotropical and Neotropical) and two of which are largely temperate (Palearctic and Nearctic). Appendix table 1 summarizes the number of species and countries represented in each of these realms.

Species' populations in the Afrotropical realm show signs of recovery since the mid-1990s when the index reached a low of -55%. This increase may partly be due to better protection of wildlife in nature reserves and national parks in countries where relatively good data is available, such as Uganda (Pomeroy, D.a.H.T., 2009). Data from a greater range of African countries would provide a more detailed picture of these trends and the drivers behind them.

The decline reflects widespread land-use changes and industrialization across the region since 1970, but is also due in part to catastrophic declines in amphibian numbers caused in many cases by the spread of fungal disease. Tropical forest loss in this realm is estimated to be around 0.5% per year, with the total area lost between 2000 and 2005 being in the range of 3­4 million hectares per year (FAO, 2005; Hansen, M.C. et al., 2008).
Figure 13. Palearctic LPI +43%
The increase may be due to species' populations recovering following better environmental protection since 1970 in some countries. However, as most population data comes from Europe, with comparatively little data from northern Asia, data from individual countries could provide a different picture.

Figure 14. Indo-Pacific LPI -66%
Includes the Indomalayan, Australasian and Oceanic realms. The decline reflects rapid agricultural, industrial and urban development across the region, which has led to the most rapid destruction and fragmentation of forests, wetlands and river systems anywhere in the world (Loh, J. et al., 2006; MEA, 2005b). Tropical forest cover between 1990 and 2005, for example, declined more rapidly in Southeast Asia than in Africa or Latin America, with estimates ranging from 0.6 % to 0.8 % per year (FAO, 2005; Hansen, M.C. et al., 2008).

Biogeographic realms Biogeographic realms combine geographic regions with the historic and evolutionary distribution patterns of terrestrial plants and animals. They represent large areas of the Earth's surface separated by major barriers to plant and animal migration -- such as oceans, broad deserts and high mountain ranges -- where terrestrial species have evolved in relative isolation over long periods of time.

Measuring human demand: Ecological Footprint

The Ecological Footprint is an accounting framework that tracks humanity's competing demands on the biosphere by comparing human demand against the regenerative capacity of the planet. It does this by adding together the areas required to provide renewable resources people use, the areas occupied by infrastructure, and the areas required for absorbing waste. In the current National Footprint Accounts, the resource inputs tracked include crops and fish for food as well as other uses, timber, and grass used to feed livestock. CO2 is the only waste product currently included. Since people consume resources from all over the world, the Ecological Footprint of consumption, the measure reported here, adds together these areas regardless of where they are located on the planet.
To determine whether human demand for renewable resources and CO2 uptake can be maintained, the Ecological Footprint is compared to the regenerative capacity (or `biocapacity') of the planet. Biocapacity is the total regenerative capacity available to serve the demand represented by the Footprint. Both the Ecological Footprint (which represents demand for resources) and biocapacity (which represents the availability of resources) are expressed in units called global hectares (gha), with 1gha representing the productive capacity of 1ha of land at world average productivity.

Calculated from the area of land covered by human infrastructure, including transportation, housing, industrial structures, and reservoirs for hydropower

Ecological overshoot is growing
During the 1970s, humanity as a whole passed the point at which the annual Ecological Footprint matched the Earth's annual biocapacity -- that is, the Earth's human population began consuming renewable resources faster than ecosystems can regenerate them and releasing more CO2 than ecosystems can absorb. This situation is called ""ecological overshoot"", and has continued since then.
The latest Ecological Footprint shows this trend is unabated (Figure 16). In 2007, humanity's Footprint was 18 billion gha, or 2.7gha per person. However, the Earth's biocapacity was only 11.9 billion gha, or 1.8gha per person (Figure 17 and GFN, 2010a). This represents an ecological overshoot of 50 per cent. This means it would take 1.5 years for the Earth to regenerate the renewable resources that people used in 2007 and absorb CO2 waste. Put another way, people used the equivalent of 1.5 planets in 2007 to support their activities (see Box: What does overshoot really mean?).

Figure 16: Ecological Footprint by component, 1961­2007
The Footprint is shown as number of planets. Total biocapacity, represented by the dashed line, always equals one planet Earth, although the biological productivity of the planet changes each year. Hydropower is included in built-up land and fuel wood in the forest component (Global Footprint Network, 2010)

What does overshoot really mean? How can humanity be using the capacity of 1.5 Earths, when there is only one? Just as it is easy to withdraw more money from a bank account than the interest this money generates, it is possible to harvest renewable resources faster than they are being generated. More wood can be taken from a forest each year than re-grows, and more fish can be harvested than are replenished each year. But doing so is only possible for a limited time, as the resource will eventually be depleted.
Similarly, CO2 emissions can exceed the rate at which forests and other ecosystems are able to absorb them, meaning additional Earths would be required to fully sequester these emissions.
Exhaustion of natural resources has already happened locally in some places, for example the collapse of cod stocks in Newfoundland in the 1980s. At present, people are often able to shift their sourcing when this happens -- moving to a new fishing ground or forest, clearing new land for farming, or targeting a different population or a still-common species. But at current consumption rates, these resources will eventually run out too -- and some ecosystems will collapse even before the resource is completely gone.
The consequences of excess greenhouse gases that cannot be absorbed by vegetation are also being seen: increasing concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to increasing global temperatures and climate change, and ocean acidification. These place additional stresses on biodiversity and ecosystems.




Map 3: Global map of the relative Ecological Footprint per person in 2007 The darker the colour, the higher the Ecological Footprint per person (Global Footprint Network, 2010)
Ecological Footprint: National Examining the Ecological Footprint at the per-person level shows that people living in different countries differ greatly in their demand on the Earth's ecosystems (Map 3 and Figure 17). For example, if everyone in the world lived like an average resident of the United States or the United Arab Emirates, then a biocapacity equivalent to more than 4.5 Earths would be required to keep up with humanity's consumption and CO2 emissions. Conversely, if everyone lived like the average resident of India, humanity would be using less than half the planet's biocapacity.
Carbon: the largest footprint component The largest footprint component is the carbon footprint. This has increased by 35 per cent since the publication of the first Living Planet Report in 1998, and currently accounts for more than half of the global Ecological Footprint (Figure 16).


Ecological Footprint: Economic level
The Ecological Footprint according to four political groupings which broadly represent different economic levels, illustrates that higherincome, more developed countries generally make higher demands on the Earth's ecosystems than poorer, less developed countries. In 2007, the 31 OECD countries -- which include the world's richest economies -- accounted for 37 per cent of humanity's Ecological Footprint. In contrast, the 10 ASEAN countries and 53 African Union countries -- which include some of the world's poorest and least developed countries -- together accounted for only 12 per cent of the global Footprint (Figure 18).


As well as reflecting the amount of goods and services consumed and CO2 waste generated by the average resident, Ecological Footprint is also a function of population. As shown in Figure 19, the average per-person Ecological Footprint is much smaller in BRIC countries than in OECD countries; however, as there are over twice as many people living in BRIC countries as in OECD countries, their total Ecological Footprint approaches that of OECD countries. The current higher rate of growth in the perperson Footprint of BRIC countries means these four countries have the potential to overtake the 31 OECD countries in their total consumption.

Ecological Footprint: Changes over time For the first time, this edition of the Living Planet Report looks at how the Ecological Footprint has changed over time in different political groupings, both in magnitude and relative contribution of each footprint component.
The total Ecological Footprint of the four political groups has more than doubled between 1961 and 2007. In all groups, the greatest increase has been in the carbon footprint (Figure 20). Although the carbon footprint of the OECD is by far the largest of all regions and has increased tenfold since 1961, it has not increased the most rapidly: the carbon footprint of ASEAN countries increased by more than 100 times, while that of BRIC countries increased 20-fold and that of African Union countries increased 30-fold.



In contrast, the relative contribution from the cropland, grazing land and forest footprint components has generally decreased for all regions. The decrease in the cropland footprint is the most marked, falling from 44­62 per cent in all groupings in 1961 to 18­35 per cent in 2007. This shift from a biomass- to a carbon-dominated Ecological Footprint reflects the substituti0n of fossil-fuel-based energy for ecological resource consumption.

Analysis of biocapacity at the national level reveals that over half the world's biocapacity is found within the borders of just ten countries. Brazil has the most biocapacity, followed in decreasing order by China, the United States, the Russian Federation, India, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, Argentina and France (Figure 21).
Biocapacity per person, calculated by dividing national biocapacity by the country's population, is also not equivalent around the world. In 2007, the country with the highest biocapacity per person was Gabon, followed in decreasing order by Bolivia, Mongolia, Canada and Australia (Figure 22). In a world in ecological overshoot, the uneven distribution of biocapacity raises geopolitical and ethical questions regarding sharing of the world's resources.

Measuring biocapacity
Biocapacity includes cropland for producing food, fibre and biofuels; grazing land for animal products such as meat, milk, leather and wool; coastal and inland fishing grounds; and forests, which both provide wood and can absorb CO2.
Biocapacity takes into account the area of land available, as well as the productivity of the land, measured by how much the crops or trees growing on it yield per hectare. Cropland in dry and/ or cold countries, for example, may be less productive than cropland in warmer and/or wetter countries. If a nation's land and sea are highly productive, a country's biocapacity may include more global hectares than it has actual hectares. Similarly, increases in crop yields will increase biocapacity. For example, the area of land used for growing the most prevalent crops, cereals, has remained relatively constant since 1961, while the yield per hectare has more than doubled.

THE WATER FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTION

The Water Footprint of Production provides a measure of water use in different countries, as well as an indication of human demand on national water resources (Chapagain, A.K. and Hoekstra, A.Y., 2004). It accounts for the volume of green (rain) and blue (withdrawn) water consumed in the production of agricultural goods from crops and livestock -- the major use of water (Figure 24) -- as well as the grey (polluted) water generated by agriculture and from household and industrial water uses (see Box: Calculating the water footprint).

Figure 24: The total Water Footprint of Production for agriculture, industry and for household use; and the proportion of grey, green and blue water within the Water Footprint of Production of the agricultural sector (Chapagain, A.K., 2010)

Many countries are experiencing water stress
Different countries use and pollute vastly different volumes of water (Figure 26). More critically, this places differing levels of water stress on national water resources. Water stress is calculated as the ratio of the sum of the blue and grey Water Footprints of Production to available renewable water resources. As shown in Figure 26, 45 countries are currently experiencing moderate to severe stress on blue water sources. These include major producers of agricultural goods for national and global markets, including India, China, Israel and Morocco. This strain on water resources will only become more acute with increased human populations and economic growth, and be further exacerbated by the effects of climate change.
One limitation of this analysis is that it looks only at a national level, whereas water use is very much at a local or river basin level. Thus, countries classified as not being under water stress may have areas under high stress, and vice versa. For this reason, the analysis should be further refined to a local and river basin level.


Calculating the water footprint The Water Footprint of Production is the volume of freshwater used by people to produce goods, measured over the full supply chain, as well as the water used in households and industry, specified geographically and temporally. It has three components:
-- Green water footprint: The volume of rainwater that evaporates during the production of goods; for agricultural products, this is the rainwater stored in soil that evaporates from crop fields.
-- Blue water footprint: The volume of freshwater withdrawn from surface or groundwater sources that is used by people and not returned; in agricultural products this is mainly accounted for by evaporation of irrigation water from fields.
-- Grey water footprint: the volume of water required to dilute pollutants released in production processes to such an extent that the quality of the ambient water remains above agreed water quality standards. In this report, given a lack of adequate data, one unit of return flow is assumed to pollute one unit of freshwater; however, this significantly underestimates the grey water footprint of production.
Given the negligible volume of water that evaporates during domestic and industrial processes, the Water Footprint of Production only includes the grey water footprint for households and industry. The figures assign all water use and pollution to the country in which these activities occurred, regardless of where the final products were consumed (see Box: How much water is in your coffee?; and Hoekstra, A.Y. and Chapagain, A.K., 2008).

Figure 25: The water footprint of a product

How much water is in your coffee?
The Water Footprint of Production for an agricultural product includes all the water used and polluted in growing the particular crop; however, the total water footprint of the final product additionally includes all the water used and polluted in each subsequent step of the production chain as well as in its consumption (Hoekstra, A.Y. et al., 2009). This is also referred to as ""virtual water"".

Water footprint of a cup of black coffee: 140 litres This includes the water used for growing the coffee plant, harvesting, refining, transporting and packaging the coffee beans, selling the coffee, and brewing the final cup (Chapagain, A.K. and Hoekstra, A.Y., 2007).
Water footprint of a takeaway latte with sugar: 200 litres The water footprint increases even further when milk and sugar are added -- and will even vary according to whether the sugar came from sugarcane or sugar beet. If the final product is a takeaway coffee in a disposable cup, the water footprint will include the volume of water used to produce the cup as well.



Focus on our footprint: Freshwater

There is enough water available to meet human needs We all live at the water's edge, whether we are at the end of a pipe or the bank of a river. We need water for our basic survival, for

1%

cultivating crops, for generating energy and for producing the goods that we use every day. Although less than one per cent of water on the Earth is currently accessible for direct human use (UNESCOWWAP, 2006), there is enough water available to meet human and


environmental needs. The challenge is to secure enough water of



good quality in a way that doesn't destroy the very ecosystems from FOR HUMANS
which we take our water supplies ­ rivers, lakes and aquifers.

However, the use of freshwater ecosystem services --

including, but not limited to, water supply -- is now well beyond

levels that can be sustained even at current demands (MEA,

2005b). Moreover, forecasts consistently suggest that demand for

water -- our water footprint -- will continue to rise in most parts of

the world (Gleick, P., et al., 2009). The major impacts of our water

footprint on freshwater ecosystems globally include increased river

fragmentation, over-abstraction and water pollution. The looming

impacts of climate change may well exacerbate the situation. Finally,

the global knock-on effects of water scarcity are being realized as

water footprinting techniques shed light on how dependent countries

and companies are on the trade of ""virtual water"" embedded in

commodities and products.



Water and people
-- Billions of people, primarily in developing countries, obtain their drinking water directly from rivers, lakes, streams, springs and wetlands.
-- It was estimated that in 1995 about 1.8 billion people were living in areas experiencing severe water stress (UNESCO-WWAP, 2006). By 2025, it is estimated that about two-thirds of the world's population -- about 5.5 billion people -- will live in areas facing moderate to severe water stress (UNESCO-WWAP, 2006).
-- Freshwater fish can provide as much as 70 per cent of animal protein in many developing countries (MEA, 2005b).

River fragmentation
Increased demand for water and hydroelectricity, together with efforts to control flooding and aid river navigation, have led to the construction of dams and other infrastructure such as locks, weirs and dykes on most of the large rivers around the world. Globally, out of 177 large rivers longer than 1,000 km, only 64 remain freeflowing, unimpeded by dams or other barriers (WWF, 2006). Water infrastructure can bring benefits but it also has profound impacts on freshwater ecosystems and on those who depend on services provided by such ecosystems. Dams alter river flow regimes by changing the quantity, timing and quality of water that flows downstream. The largest dams can completely sever ecological connections between upstream and downstream habitats, for migratory fish for instance. Flood defence structures can sever the connection between a river and its floodplain, impacting on wetland habitats. Growing demand for low-carbon energy, water storage capacity and flood control appears to be causing a new drive to build dams and other infrastructure across the globe. Recent research has estimated that nearly 500 million people have had their lives and livelihoods negatively affected by the construction of dams (Richter, 2010).



Rivers running dry
In recent decades, increasing abstraction of water has led to some of the world's largest rivers running dry. For instance, the Yellow River in China stopped flowing in its downstream and mouth for lengthy periods during the 1990s; the challenge of maintaining flow in the Murray River in Australia is well documented; and the Rio Grande, which forms the border between the US and Mexico, runs dry for significant stretches. In order to satisfy increasing demand, water is also being transferred over great distances from one river basin to another, which can compound ecological impacts. Sometimes this is on a large scale, as in the case of the south-north water transfer scheme in China.

Water pollution
There have been some great successes in addressing problems of urban and industrial pollution in developed countries in the last 20 years, often due to stricter legislation and the allocation of very significant budgets to improved wastewater treatment facilities. Nevertheless, pollution remains a major problem for many river systems. After it has been used for domestic, industrial or agricultural purposes, any water that hasn't evapo-transpired is normally returned into freshwater ecosystems. These return flows are often loaded with nutrients, contaminants and sediments. They can also be warmer than the receiving waters, for instance when water has been used for cooling purposes in thermal power generation. Every day two million tonnes of sewage and other effluents drain into the world's waters (UNESCO-WWAP, 2003). The situation in developing countries is particularly acute, where 70 per cent of untreated industrial wastes are disposed into water where they contaminate existing water supplies (UN-Water, 2009). The consequent reduction in water quality has profound impacts on the health of species and habitats. In addition, poor water quality affects the health of downstream water users.

Climate impacts and uncertainty
Water is the primary medium through which climate change influences the Earth's ecosystems (Stern, N., 2006). Although precise scientific forecasts remain elusive, there is a consensus among many scientists that melting glaciers, shifting precipitation patterns and increasingly intense and frequent droughts and floods are expected as the global climate changes in the coming decades (IPCC, 2007a).



Increasing demand for water, hydroelectricity and flood protection will make protection of rivers even more challenging. In this context, rivers are flowing into a highly uncertain future.


Virtual water and global trade
As we saw in the previous section, with new water footprinting tools we are able to understand the full extent of a nation's, or a company's, dependence on global water resources. The numbers can be startling: the water footprint of a cup of black coffee, for instance, is about 140 litres (Figure 25). When goods and services are traded between countries, so is the virtual water they contain. This global trade may add substantially to a country's water footprint. For example, while an average household in the UK uses around 150 litres per person per day, UK consumption of products from other countries means that each UK resident effectively soaks up 4,645 litres of the world's water every day. The source of this water is also important. A recent study found that 62 per cent of the UK's water footprint is virtual water embedded in agricultural commodities and products imported from other countries; only 38 per cent is used from domestic water resources (Chapagain, A.K. and Orr, S., 2008). The major sources of these products are shown in Map 5. Most of the virtual water comes from Brazil, Ghana, France, Ireland and India. Brazil provides soybeans, coffee and livestock products, while France provides mainly meat products, and India, cotton, rice and tea. However, the impact of these footprints may not be reflected in the number of litres of water. A smaller footprint can create more negative impacts in a river basin which is relatively more water stressed. Conversely, certain water footprint figures have large green water components, which may have a positive impact in the production regions by supporting the livelihoods of local communities.
What this shows is that UK consumption of food and clothing (and indeed that of all countries that import food and clothing) has an impact on rivers and aquifers globally and is inextricably linked to the continuing security and good management of water resources in other parts of the world.




In a globalized world, many nations and large companies will have a vested interest in ensuring sustainable use of water overseas in order to ensure their own food security or their supply chains. This is why a number of multinational corporations are investing in projects to support water-efficient agricultural practices along their supply chains.
A smaller number of companies are also understanding that, unless water resources are sustainably managed at the river-basin level, any efforts they make to be water-efficient are likely to be lost as demand from other water users increases. This presents an opportunity to mobilize a new community of water stewards in the private sector who can advocate and support better management and sustainable allocation of water resources.


Focus on our footprint: Marine fisheries
Fish are vital to billions of people around the world Wild fish form a central food source for billions of people -- and are increasingly used as feed for poultry, livestock and farmed fish. The habitats that support commercial marine fish populations are also important, providing coastal protection from storms and other large waves, supporting marine-based tourism, and shaping the cultural identity of coastal societies around the world. These habitats, especially those in coastal areas, also house the vast majority of marine biodiversity.

3 billion
Nearly 3 billion people get at least 15% of their average animal protein intake from fish

TOp 10
Most of the stocks of the top ten caught species, which account for about 30% of marine catches, are either fully exploited or overexploited and therefore cannot be expected to produce major increases in catches in the near future
(All figures come from FAO, 2009b).

1/2
Slightly more than half of the marine fish stocks (52%) were fully exploited with no room for further expansion

28%
In 2007, 28% of monitored marine fish stocks were either overexploited (19%), depleted (8%) or recovering from depletion (1%)



Overfishing is the greatest threat to fish stocks and marine

biodiversity

High demand for fish and fish products combined with overcapacity

in the global fishing fleet and inefficient fishing techniques have

driven massive overfishing. This is often encouraged by subsidies,

which support fishing activity even for depleted stocks that would otherwise be unprofitable.
Seventy per cent of commercial marine fish stocks are now threatened, with some fisheries and stocks, such as Mediterranean

Increase fisheries' biocapacity through protected areas

bluefin tuna, already on the verge of collapse. As large, long-lived

predators like cod and tuna have become depleted, fishing fleets have

increasingly turned to small, short-lived species further down the

food chain, like sardines, squid, shrimp and even krill -- threatening

the balance of entire marine ecosystems. Damaging fishing practices

and a high level of incidental catch of non-target species (bycatch)

further threaten marine habitats and species around the globe.

Better management practices could help to restore fisheries
Sustainable fisheries management can help to restore and maintain both fisheries' productivity and marine biodiversity. This would also increase the resistance of fisheries and marine ecosystems to other pressures like pollution, increased ocean acidification and climate change, as well as safeguard food supplies for coastal communities. However, there are challenges and tough choices, including:
-- Accepting the short-term economic pain of drastic catch reductions in many marine fisheries, for future long-term benefits
-- Improving fishing governance, especially on the high seas (areas beyond national jurisdiction)
-- Balancing further expansion of aquaculture with the protection of wild fish stocks, biodiversity and habitats

Biocapacity, biodiversity and fish
In order to maintain, and even increase fish catches in the long term, fisheries' biocapacity needs to be increased. At the fisheries management level, this means maintaining fish stocks at optimal population and age levels to maximize growth, while at the ecosystem level it means improving and conserving marine habitats by establishing protected areas, limiting coastal pollution and curbing carbon dioxide emissions.



Increasing biodiversity itself may also be an important way to increase the biocapacity of fish stocks: conserving all populations offers species more genetic potential to adapt to changing or new environments, and so ensure long-term productivity rates.

Every year the fins of approximately four million
hammerhead sharks are harvested

Bitten by bad governance
One major problem behind overfishing is poor fisheries management. Governance issues include systematic failures by many fisheries bodies to heed scientific advice on fish quotas, few international regulations for fishing on the high seas, and the failure of many countries to ratify, implement and/or enforce existing national and international regulations.
The case of shark fishing exemplifies these problems. Sharks are sought after in international trade for their fins, meat, liver oil, cartilage and hides, and as aquarium specimens. An estimated 1.3 million smooth and 2.7 million scalloped hammerhead sharks, whose fins are among the most valuable, are harvested annually. Unprocessed fins of the latter have reached wholesale prices in excess of US$100/kg. This high value means that, even when sharks are caught as part of fishing activities for other species such as tuna (as often happens), they are usually retained rather than being discarded. Frequently, only the fins are retained, with the carcasses being dumped -- even though this practice is illegal in some jurisdictions.
Most shark species mature late and have a relatively low reproductive output compared to other fish species. As a result, they are inherently vulnerable to overexploitation. Nevertheless, most of the 31 top shark fishing nations have not even implemented national plans to regulate their shark fisheries as recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and management of shark fisheries by regional fisheries bodies is haphazard or non-existent. Furthermore, proposals to regulate international trade in sharks via the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) have been strongly resisted -- in March of 2010, four such proposals were rejected by CITES Parties.



Millions of tonnes per year Estimated number of individuals

Focus on our footprint: Forests

Forests are central to all our lives Forests provide building materials, wood from which paper is made, fuel, food and medicinal plants, as well as shade for crops like coffee and cocoa. They store carbon, help regulate the climate, mitigate the impact of floods, landslides, and other natural hazards, and purify water. They also contain nearly 90 per cent of the world's terrestrial biodiversity, including the pollinators and wild relatives of many agricultural crops.
Squeezed out for margarine? Demand for palm oil has doubled over the last decade and it has become an important export commodity for several tropical countries. Global production and demand for palm oil have soared since the 1970s (Figure 27).



Malaysia and Indonesia now dominate global production of palm oil, accounting for 87 per cent of global supply and distribution (FAS, 2008). But this valuable and versatile raw material -- used in a wide variety of foods, soap and cosmetic products, and increasingly as a biofuel -- comes at a price. The development of new plantations to meet growing demand has led to



the conversion of large areas of tropical forests with high conservation value. Oil palm cultivation area has increased nearly eightfold over the last 20 years, to an estimated 7.8 million ha in 2010.
This is putting the survival of several species in danger -- notably orang-utans. Living only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, these apes are unable to survive in degraded and fragmented forest. The impact of an increasing global demand for palm oil products continues to be one of the main driving factors behind a recent dramatic decline in numbers (Nantha, H.S. and Tisdell, C., 2009). Estimates suggest that the two orang-utan species have already undergone a tenfold decrease in population size during the 20th century (Goossens, B. et al., 2006) and many populations are now at very low numbers. (See example in Figure 28 below).
Worldwide demand for palm oil is expected to double again by 2020. WWF supports mechanisms such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil that are working to develop and promote environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable practices in the oil palm industry.

Getting more wood from the trees The significantly greater productivity of timber plantations over natural forests provides valuable new opportunities for future supplies of timber, pulp, biofuels and biomaterials -- as well as economic growth and employment.
Furthermore, well managed and appropriately located, plantations can be compatible with both biodiversity conservation and human needs. While plantations may not provide the same range of ecosystem services as natural forests, in cases where land is degraded or eroded by a prior unsustainable use such as overgrazing, they may help to recover some ecosystem services.
However, much plantation expansion in Latin America, Asia and Africa to date has come from the conversion of natural forests and other high conservation value areas such as grasslands and wetlands. In many cases, their establishment has also had significant social consequences due to a disregard for the rights and interests of local communities. WWF is working with stakeholders to determine best practice for a new generation of plantations that combine high productivity with the necessary safeguards for biodiversity and social values.


Mapping ecosystem services: Terrestrial carbon storage

The LPI, Ecological Footprint and Water Footprint of Production monitor changes in ecosystem health and human demand on ecosystems, but do not provide any information on the state or use of particular ecosystem services -- the benefits that people derive from ecosystems, and upon which food and water supplies, livelihoods and economies are based.

INDICATORS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE OVERVIEW
OF CHANGE

Why do we need ecosystem service indicators? Developing indicators for different ecosystem services -- such as water purification, crop pollination and fuel wood supply -- would help to quantify the benefits that healthy ecosystems provide to people. This is an essential first step to assigning an economic value to ecosystem services -- which can lead to enormous new incentives for conservation (see Box: Carbon markets and REDD). Such indicators would also help identify regions where the continued provision of such services is, or could become, under threat. This knowledge would help to inform the policies and decisions of both governments and the private sector so that they can incorporate ecosystem services into their policy and decision-making processes and encourage their conservation. Despite the importance of ecosystem services to human economies and livelihoods, we have yet to develop indicators that measure the supply and the demand for many of these services. Producing such indicators is therefore the focus of intense research. ZSL, GFN and WWF are all part of a global research effort to develop a range of indicators to track changes in services ranging from carbon storage and water purification to crop pollination.

One of the most well developed ecosystem service indicators at a global scale is terrestrial carbon storage. Therefore, this edition of the Living Planet Report includes an ecosystem service indicator for terrestrial carbon storage (Map 6). This map of carbon density in forests and other ecosystems not only quantifies and locates current carbon stocks in a globally consistent way, but also helps to quantify potential emissions from land-use changes in different areas.

Map 6: Global map of terrestrial carbon density, including vegetation and soil carbon pools. Units are metric tonnes of carbon/hectare (Kapos, V. et al., 2008: see references for full source data)

The continued provision of terrestrial carbon storage is vital in the effort to prevent dangerous climate change, but is under threat due to continued land-use changes. Moreover, identifying and quantifying carbon stocks is essential for current Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) and REDD+ efforts, which seek to provide incentives for conserving forests by compensating countries and landowners for the carbon stored within them (see Box: Carbon markets and REDD). REDD+ mechanisms directly avoid or prevent deforestation that is projected to occur under a ""business as usual"" scenario. REDD+ activities can include the conservation, sustainable management or enhancement of existing forests that are not immediately threatened by deforestation.

uantifying carbon stocks
Satellite images are the back bone for monitoring forest status and forest change, but fall short of quantifying carbon stocks because they cannot penetrate the forest and quantify the forest's structure within. LIDAR fills that critical gap by providing high resolution forest maps that can be used to quantify biomass and ultimately carbon through the use of strategically placed calibration measurements on the ground. LIDAR is a critical tool for quantifying carbon emissions and fulfilling obligations for REDD+ compliance.

Carbon markets and REDD
Carbon storage by ecosystems reduces the speed and magnitude of climate change. A tonne of carbon stored anywhere benefits people everywhere, making everyone on Earth a `user', or `beneficiary', of this ecosystem service. This globalized benefit makes global markets for carbon storage services possible -- and indeed, such markets already exist, putting a value on carbon as a global commodity.
Putting a price on carbon and paying landowners for storing it represents an enormous new incentive for conservation. REDD is an effort to use this financial value as an incentive for developing countries to reduce emissions from land-use change in forested areas and invest in low-carbon paths to sustainable development.


Building up a picture of multiple services
For forest carbon activities to play a key part in the global strategy to reduce carbon emissions, they must be carried out in ways that produce measurable emissions reductions while protecting biodiversity, upholding indigenous peoples' and local communities' rights, and promoting practices for appropriate benefit-sharing with local stakeholders. This holds true for both voluntary activities and a potential future compliance system under mechanisms such as REDD+. To maximize the biodiversity benefits of such payments, areas where high carbon and high biodiversity overlap need to be identified (Strassburg, B.B.N. et al., 2010). Map 7 identifies these overlaps among ecoregions, and reveals a world of win-win opportunities and trade-offs between carbon storage and biodiversity. Conservation efforts in ecoregions with relatively high levels of both carbon and endemic biodiversity (shown in light green in Map 7) are more likely to support the goals of both climate mitigation and conservation, and are more likely to attract carbonrelated funding.
It is important to note, however, that even high carbon/high biodiversity ecoregions can contain areas in which biodiversity and carbon storage do not overlap. On the other hand, every ecoregion will contain local win­win opportunities, especially when services operating over relatively small scales (e.g. pollination by wild insects) are considered. Although finer-scale analyses will be essential for targeting specific conservation action at the local level, global analyses nevertheless remain broadly useful.

Map 7 : Overlap of biodiversity and carbon storage among ecoregions of the world Light green ecoregions contain relatively high levels (i.e. above the global median) of endemic biodiversity (i.e. vertebrate species found nowhere else) and carbon (in vegetation and soils); dark brown ecoregions have low biodiversity but high carbon; dark green ecoregions have high biodiversity and low carbon; grey ecoregions are below the global median for both measures (modified and updated from Kapos, V. et al., 2008; Naidoo, R. et al., 2008)



Mapping a local ecosystem service:Freshwater provision
In contrast to the worldwide benefits of carbon storage, water-related services are delivered locally, mainly to those living downstream. This has made it difficult for scientists to directly quantify these benefits on a global scale. We can, however, create global indicators that identify areas of high potential for providing freshwater services to people.
Map 8a shows one such indicator: a global map of surface water ""runoff"" -- the supply of freshwater available for use downstream. It is based on a global model called WaterGAP (Alcamo et al., 2003) that accounts for precipitation, vegetation, topography and losses to groundwater to estimate runoff for all areas of the world.
Ecosystem services are by definition benefits that people derive from nature, and any rigorous indicator must account for both the supply and use of the service. Map 8b combines freshwater runoff from Map 8a (supply) with water use by people (demand) within each of the world's river basins (Naidoo et al., 2008). The map identifies areas where most water is supplied to most people, and therefore where the potential importance of freshwater ecosystem services is currently highest. This information is useful for the management of water resources and of the ecosystems that provide water-related services. For example, it could help direct the development of water funds, which are rapidly being established in several countries to pay for land management that protects these water-related services.

Units are km3/year for each cell on both of the above maps (redrawn from Naidoo, R. et al., 2008)


The difference between the two maps is striking, and underlines the importance of accounting for both supply and use in developing indicators of ecosystem services. Many areas in the world provide huge quantities of freshwater (dark blue on Map 8a, e.g. Amazon and Congo basins), but, with relatively few people living downstream to realize the benefits, the potential importance of freshwater ecosystem services is currently low (light green on Map 8b). Conversely, less water is available in eastern Australia and northern Africa, but, with many downstream users, freshwater services have higher potential.
Of course, these maps indicate only one ecosystem service, and conservation decisions should not be based on any single factor. Biodiversity importance, as well as additional ecosystem services (e.g. carbon storage, freshwater fisheries), should also be taken into account.
With water demand destined to rise (Gleick, et al., 2009) and water supplies becoming less predictable due to climate change (IPCC, 2007a), this ecosystem service indicator is bound to change in the future. Tracking it and other indicators over time will provide a picture of how ecosystem services are changing along with biodiversity and our human footprint.


Chapter two: living on our planet~
In this section we take a closer look at the links between consumption, people and biodiversity. We begin by exploring the current relationship between human development and Ecological Footprint. For the first time, we also look at trends in biodiversity according to World Bank country income category. Using the Footprint Scenario Calculator developed by the Global Footprint Network, we then present various scenarios for ending ecological overshoot by changing different variables related to resource consumption, land use and productivity. These scenarios further illustrate the sensitivities that exist and the tough choices we all need to make in order to close the gap between Ecological Footprint and biocapacity -- and so live within the limits of our planet.

Biodiversity, development and human well-being
Consumption and development Is increased consumption needed for increased development? The Ecological Footprint analyses presented in this report show that individuals from different countries consume vastly different amounts, with richer, more developed countries tending to consume more than poorer, less developed countries.
A high level of human development -- where people have the ability to reach their potential and lead productive, creative lives in accord with their needs and interests (UNDP, 2009) -- is clearly essential for all individuals. An important question to ask is whether a high level of consumption is necessary for a high level of human development.
Currently the most widely used indicator for development is the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Index (HDI) which, by combining income, life expectancy and educational attainment, compares countries based on both their economic and social development level (UNDP, 2009a).
The relationship between Ecological Footprint and HDI is not linear but instead has two distinct parts (Figure 30). In countries with a low level of development, development level is independent of per capita Footprint. However, as development increases beyond a certain level, so does per person Footprint -- eventually to the point where small gains in HDI come at the cost of very large Footprint increases.
The UN defines the threshold for a high level of development as an HDI value of 0.8. Countries meeting or exceeding this threshold show an enormous range in per person Ecological Footprint, from Peru with a Footprint of just over 1.5gha to Luxembourg with a Footprint of over 9gha per person. The range is similar even for countries with the highest levels of development. Moreover, several countries with a high level of development have a similar per person Footprint to countries with a much lower level of development. Together with the breakdown in connection between wealth and well-being above a certain level of GDP per capita (Figure 31), this indicates that a high level of consumption is not necessarily required for a high level of development or well-being.

Sustainable development is possible Sustainable development is defined as meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (World Commission on Environment and Development). An HDI of 0.8 sets the lower limit for ""meeting the needs of the present"", while an Ecological Footprint of <1.8gha per person -- set by the Earth's biocapacity and human population -- sets an upper limit for living within the Earth's ecological capacity and so not ""compromising future generations"".
Together, these indicators form a ""sustainability box"" which defines the criteria that must be met for a globally sustainable society. In 2007 there was only one country in this box: Peru, which falls just inside with an HDI score of 0.806 and an Ecological Footprint of just over 1.5gha per person. Cuba has been within this box in previous years (WWF, 2006b) but, with an Ecological Footprint of 1.85gha in 2007, it now falls just outside the lower boundary. Colombia and Ecuador similarly fall just outside the Footprint boundary.
These examples illustrate that it is possible for countries to meet minimum criteria for sustainability. However, it must be remembered that this analysis is only at a national level and does not take into account socio-economic variation and distribution or levels of civic influence and democracy within a country. One of the most widely used indices of income inequality is the Gini coefficient in which countries are given a score ranging from 0, where income is perfectly equal between individuals, and 100, where income is perfectly unequal (i.e. one person has all the income).
Peru has a relatively high Gini coefficient (49.8 in 2007), indicating that distribution of income is not equitable. This highlights the importance of using more than one indicator to comprehensively assess the multiple facets of social, environmental and economic sustainability.
As mentioned earlier, the biocapacity available per person is not fixed, but will shrink as the human population grows. This is indicated in Figure 30: when there were considerably fewer people in 1961, the biocapacity available per person was about double what it is today. The sustainability box is therefore a moving target, and unless methods can be found to increase biocapacity it will become increasingly difficult for countries to fall within it.


Biodiversity and national income

The Living Planet Index by income group
The LPI analyses presented earlier in this report show strong geographic differences in biodiversity loss between tropical and temperate regions as well as between biogeographic realms. To show that these differences are not necessarily geographic or biophysical in nature, we divided the species population data (except marine species which could not be assigned to a country) into three sets according to country income (see Box: Country income categories).
The LPI for high-income countries shows an increase of 5 per cent between 1970 and 2007 (Figure 32). In stark contrast, the LPI for middle-income countries has declined by 25 per cent, while the index for low-income countries has declined by 58 per cent in the same period. The trend in low-income countries is particularly alarming, not just for biodiversity but also for the people living in these countries. While everyone depends on ecosystem services and natural assets, and hence biodiversity, the impact of environmental degradation is felt most directly by the world's poorest and most vulnerable people. Without access to clean water, land and adequate food, fuel and materials, vulnerable people cannot break out of the poverty trap and prosper.

Map 9: High, middle and low­income countries (classified according to World Bank classifications, 2007: World Bank, 2003)

Country income categories The World Bank classifies economies according to 2007 Gross National Income (GNI) per person, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method and the Atlas conversion factor (World Bank, 2003 Map 9). The purpose of the Atlas conversion factor is to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations when comparing the national income of different countries. The category boundaries for 2007 were:
High income: US$11,906 GNI per person Middle income: US$936­11,455 GNI per person* Low income: US$935 GNI per person
*Combines the World Bank categories of lower middle income and upper
middle income.


Trends in the Ecological Footprint by income group
The per person Ecological Footprint of low-income countries has decreased between 1970 and 2007, while middle-income countries' Footprint has increased slightly. The Ecological Footprint of highincome countries has not only significantly increased, but dwarfs that of the other two income groups (Figure 33).
Trade flows As discussed earlier, many drivers of biodiversity loss stem from the production and consumption of food, fibre, materials and energy. The Ecological Footprint analyses show that this consumption is much higher in high-income countries than in middle- and lowincome countries, suggesting that biodiversity loss in middle- and low-income countries is, at least in part, related to the Footprint of people living in high-income countries.
How might consumption in one country be related to biodiversity loss in a distant country? One factor is the globalization of markets and ease of movement of goods around the world, which allows countries to meet their demand for natural resources -- whether as processors or final users -- through imports from other countries. Timber from Brazil, for example, is transported to a large number of countries around the world, with timber exports dwarfing domestic trade (Map 10). Such maps of commodity flows provide a snapshot of international trade -- which is likely to be greater than official figures show due to the existence of illegal trade for many wild-sourced products.
The increasing reliance of nations on one another's natural resources and ecosystem services to support preferred patterns of consumption leads to valuable opportunities for enhancing well-being and quality of life in the exporting nations. However, without appropriate natural resource management, this can lead to unsustainable use of the resources and degradation of the environment. When aggravated by lack of adequate governance, revenue transparency or equitable access to land and resources, development and prosperity also fail to materialize.

Modelling the future: The Ecological Footprint towards 2050
Humanity is currently consuming renewable resources at a faster rate than ecosystems can regenerate them and continuing to release more CO2 than ecosystems can absorb. What will the future hold? And what actions can be taken to end ecological overshoot and so achieve One Planet Living?
The 2008 Living Planet Report introduced ""solution wedges"" to show the impact of specific actions on the future Ecological Footprint. These wedges represented actions which had the potential to shift the ""business as usual"" path towards sustainability and ultimately bring the footprint back to one planet. The Report focused on the carbon footprint, showing how three wedges -- energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage -- could reduce the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 and therefore the carbon footprint.
The Global Footprint Network has since taken this analysis a step further by creating a Footprint Scenario Calculator, first developed for the ""Vision 2050"" report by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD, 2010). This tool uses data on population, land use, land productivity, energy use, diet and climate change to estimate how the Ecological Footprint and biocapacity will change in the future. Changing these assumptions allows us to make different predictions for the future Ecological Footprint.
This edition of the Living Planet Report uses the Footprint Scenario Calculator to illustrate how changes in energy sources and diet could potentially affect each of the components of the Ecological Footprint in 2015, 2030 and 2050. Comparing these scenarios to ""business as usual"" highlights some of the challenges and choices involved in ending ecological overshoot.


Land competition
Will there be enough land to produce enough forest products (paper, building materials) and food for future human needs? And, if so, will there also be enough land available to preserve biodiversity and essential ecosystem services?
While analyses by the Food and Agriculture Organization suggest that land availability will not be an issue in the future (FAO, 2009a), this may not be the full picture. Crucially, these assessments did not take into account the land needed for growing biofuels and biomaterials at the rates needed to provide viable replacements for fossil fuel-based energy. Furthermore, climate change, water availability, land ownership/land tenure (especially for small communities and indigenous peoples), and the need for space for migratory species are all factors that will influence land availability and suitability for agriculture.
Land competition is likely to be a greater challenge in the future than conventional wisdom suggests. Indeed, WWF believes that determining the optimal allocation of land to different crops (food, biofuel, biomaterial and fibre), carbon storage and biodiversity conservation is one of the greatest challenges facing policy-makers, businesses and society.

The Earth's bioproductive area can be expanded

Increasing biocapacity
One response to an Ecological Footprint greater than one planet is to increase the biocapacity of the planet. The Earth's bioproductive area can be expanded by reclaiming degraded lands and making marginal lands more productive. For example, restoring forests or plantations on degraded land increases biocapacity not only through producing timber, but also by regulating water, preventing erosion and salination, and absorbing CO2.
Increasing the yield of crops per unit area can also increase biocapacity. Cropland and forest yields have historically increased, and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Yet predictions for what these will be vary widely. The agriculture industry forecasts that ""a doubling of agricultural output without associated increases in the amount of land or water used"" is possible by 2050 (WBCSD, 2010).

Yet an FAO Expert Meeting in 2009 on ""How to Feed the World in 2050"" suggested that crop yield increases could be only half historical rates, and that the agricultural research community would need to intensify efforts to raise yields in ""the often unfavourable agro-ecological and also often unfavourable socioeconomic environments of the countries where the additional demand will be"" (FAO, 2009a).
Further bad news on agricultural yields could come as a result of climate change. Research findings from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) indicate that climate change will cause yield declines for the most important crops and that South Asia (and especially irrigated crops) will be particularly badly hit (Nelson, G.C. et al., 2009). Therefore, although crop yields could double, the efforts of agriculturalists may be balanced out by climate change or have their uptake restricted by socioeconomic factors and governance.
How many people will there be in 2050? The global population projections used in these scenarios are UN official statistics and we have used the median projections as the basis for all the models. The UN median projections are for a global population of almost 9.2 billion people by 2050 (UN, 2008), and a stabilized global population of 9.22 billion people at or around 2075 (UN, 2004). The UN projections for global population in 2050 range from 7.8 billion to 10.9 billion (UN, 2006).


The role of cities in sustainable development
Cities are already the source of close to 80 per cent of global CO2 emissions, and they will account for an ever-higher percentage in the coming years as more and more people reside in and move to cities in search of more prosperous lifestyles. As cities expand and need more space and more resources, they have an increasing effect on the surrounding area. A recent study in Tanzania tracked how the expansion of Dar es Salaam has led to predictable ""waves"" of forest degradation and biodiversity loss, spreading up to nine kilometres per year from the city, as people need to travel greater distances to find resources such as charcoal and timber (Ahrends, A. et al., in press). City authorities and citizens therefore have a crucial role to play in preserving global biodiversity, reducing Ecological Footprint and improving social well-being and prosperity. They also have a role to play with regard to carbon footprint -- including imports of ""virtual emissions"". Collectively, cities have a unique opportunity to make a big impact over the next 30 years, during which US$350 trillion will be invested in urban infrastructure. This can be used to develop an attractive ""One Planet"" lifestyle on a large scale, particularly in fast-growing smaller cities and developing nations (WWF, 2010).

ving Planet Report 2010 scenarios
The Footprint Scenario Calculator uses the footprint data between 1961 and 2007 as a baseline, and projects the size of each footprint component in 2015, 2030 and 2050. The ""business as usual"" scenario is based on: -- A median population increase to 9.2 billion by 2050 (UN, 2008;
see box on page 84: How many people will there be in 2050?) -- CO2 emissions and biofuel use increasing in line with increased
population and economic growth (OECD/IEA, 2008) -- Forest area continuing to follow the linear trends seen between
1950 and 2005 -- Forest plantation and crop yields remaining constant -- World average daily calorie availability rising to 3130 kcal per
person by 2050, an 11 per cent increase over the level in 2003 (FAO, 2006b). The number of calories is high as it represents food production, so includes both food eaten and food wasted
In addition, increases in atmospheric CO2 and methane concentrations associated with the scenarios in food and energy were combined with the estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to give a projected warming under each scenario (IPCC, 2007b). This warming was then combined with a land suitability model (Global Agro-Ecological Zones ­ GAEZ) to predict changes in the area and suitability of land for growing crops (Fischer, G. et al., 2008).
Where does biodiversity fit into this picture? The Ecological Footprint is solely concerned with land directly related to provision of natural resources and space for infrastructure, and the absorption of CO2. However, there is an inescapable link between biodiversity and human health, wealth and well-being. It is therefore essential to explicitly recognize that a significant percentage of the Earth's area (and therefore biocapacity) needs to be allocated to support biodiversity.



Protected areas are one way to achieve this. In 2009, there were over 133,000 nationally designated protected areas covering a total of nearly 19 million square kilometres of land and sea, or 12.9 per cent of the Earth's land area and 6.3 per cent of the Earth's territorial seas. Only approximately 0.5 per cent of extraterritorial seas are currently protected (IUCN/UNEP-WCMC, 2010).
The scenarios therefore include a biodiversity wedge, set at 12 per cent of grazing land and 12 per cent of forest land set aside exclusively for biodiversity in 2015, increasing to 15 per cent of each land type in 2030 and 2050.

Bringing biofuels into the equation
In tackling the overall Footprint, it is important to recognize that footprint-reduction efforts in one area could lead to footprint increases in another. For example, fossil fuel use is the most significant contributor to humanity's Ecological Footprint. However, proposals to replace liquid fossil fuels with biofuel crops have the potential to increase pressure on land use and to increase problems caused by agriculture -- a significant threat to biodiversity (See Box: Squeezed out for margarine) and a major footprint contributor.
To reflect some of these trade-offs, a biofuel wedge has been included. This represents both agricultural crops and forests needed to produce the energy obtained from biofuels. The model has been designed so that all the crop area devoted to biofuels is assumed to be from sugar cane (a likely underestimation as sugar cane is a relatively high productivity biofuel crop). While a wedge for biofuels arguably provides a level of detail that other crops (e.g. cereals) do not have in the model, it illustrates the trade-offs that will need to be made in the future between energy and diet.



Business as usual
The ""business as usual"" scenario predicts that humanity will be using resources and land at the rate of 2 planets each year by 2030, and just over 2.8 planets each year by 2050 (Figure 34).
As the ""business as usual"" scenario shows, our present track is unsustainable. We therefore present two different pathways for the development of the world based upon changes to assumptions regarding energy and diet. We kept the same assumptions for biodiversity, crop yields and population growth.
Energy mix The carbon footprint is the largest wedge and tackling it is a priority if global temperatures are not to increase to dangerous levels. WWF is currently carrying out a new analysis that shows how it is possible to ensure that global temperatures stabilize at less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels whilst providing clean energy for the world. Using solutions with today's technology only, this involves some aggressive action to improve energy efficiency in buildings, appliances, transportation and industry. In our model, global final energy demand is 260EJ by 2050, some 15 per cent less than in 2005. A further assumption on energy is the rapid electrification of energy supply, which permits the development of a range of renewable energies -- solar, wind, geothermal and bioenergy.
We estimate that such measures will allow 95 per cent of all energy to be provided from renewable sources. Bioenergy is used as a last resort -- we assume that traditional fuelwood use will decline by two-thirds, thereby improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people. However, the need to provide solutions for long-distance transport (trucking, airlines and shipping) requires significant use of biofuels. To meet these demands we have assumed that the harvest of wood from the world's forests is doubled, whilst we increase the cropland allocated to biofuel production to 200 million ha. These both have a substantial footprint, which can be seen in an increase in the biofuels wedge from 0.04 planets in 2015 to just under 0.25 planets in 2050. This will of course have implications for agricultural production and diet -- both of which are explored in the next section.


OTHER SCENARIOS

The scenarios show us that it is possible to make dramatic



reductions in Ecological Footprint, yet some big choices are ahead

of us in two main areas -- energy and food. Today the overshoot

that takes us to 1.5 planets is largely due to the carbon footprint.

We are of course not setting aside land for CO2 absorption; rather,

in order that we may live within the land area that we have, CO2 is

being emitted to the atmosphere. The consequence of this is rising

atmospheric temperature. To avoid further dangerous increases in

atmospheric temperature we need to reduce our carbon footprint

through measures to improve energy efficiency, increase the

provision of electricity as an energy source, and replace liquid fossil

fuels with biofuels.

Whilst a roadmap on carbon footprint is possible, one is not

yet available for the next challenge, which will be food production.

The differences between the diets of Italy and Malaysia, if

multiplied across the world, are dramatic (Figure 35). The crucial

difference is not only in the total number of calories available but

in the quantity of meat and dairy products consumed. Conversion

of vegetable-based calories to animal-based calories is inefficient,

and in a resource-constrained world one of the key trade-offs that

society will need to grapple with is the quantity of land allocated

for meat and dairy production either as grassland or to produce

animal feed crops.

Our model shows that, even with a very low carbon footprint,

if 9.2 billion people were to aspire to the equivalent of the diet of

today's average Malaysian, we would still need 1.3 planets by 2050.

This raises some serious consequences. Whilst we are using the

atmosphere for our excess CO2 emissions, there is no ""safety valve""

for land. Even converting forests does not provide enough land

to grow the food needed for an Italian diet. We need to make our

existing land more productive.

In short, based upon the output from the model, optimizing

the use of land for food, fuel, fibre and biomaterials is not our only

challenge. If we are to provide enough food for the population of

the world in the future, we need both to consider our diets and to

devote significant long-term investment to raising biocapacity.

Food consumption
As wealth increases, people consume more calories and there is an increase in the consumption of protein in the form of meat and dairy products (FAO, 2006b). To investigate how this affects the Ecological Footprint, we replaced the FAO baseline diet with the diets from two contrasting countries: Italy and Malaysia.
These two countries differ firstly in their caloric intake (3,685kcal in Italy compared to 2,863kcal in Malaysia), and secondly in the amount of calories consumed in the form of meat and dairy products. The Malaysian diet is made up of 12 per cent meat and dairy products, versus 21 per cent in the Italian diet ­ half the amount when total calories are taken into account.
The first model combines the renewable energy scenario with the assumption that everyone in the world has an average Italian diet (Figure 35a). The second model assumes that everyone has an average Malaysian diet (Figure 35b). The outcomes of these are markedly different. With 9.2 billion people eating a typical Malaysian diet the Footprint reaches just under 1.3 planets by 2050, whilst following an Italian diet the Footprint in 2050 will be closer to 2 planets.


Chapter tHREE: a green economy?~

The last two years have seen the rise of discussions at an international level on the need to build a global ""green economy"". In a green economy, economic thinking embraces people and the planet. The preceding sections of this report have provided the information and assessments on a variety of issues that will need to be addressed in the coming years by governments in their policies, businesses in their practices and consumers in their choices. They all have a role to play. The scope of the challenges is significant. For its part, WWF proposes that the following six interconnected areas be the centre of attention.

1. Development pathways
Firstly, our definition and measurement of prosperity and success needs to change. In recent history, income and consumption have become important facets of development and in the last 80 years GDP has been used as the main indicator of progress. Yet it is not the full story: ultimately we should be striving for personal and societal well-being. Above a certain income level, more consumption does not dramatically increase social benefits, and further increases in income per capita do not significantly increase human well-being.
There is growing recognition that, in addition to income, well-being includes social and personal elements that together allow people to lead lives they value.
This is not to say that GDP does not have its place. It does, up to a point, but it needs to be complemented by other indicators such as those featured in this report -- the Human Development Index, the Gini coefficient, the Living Planet Index, ecosystem services indices and the Ecological Footprint. Bringing the use of natural resources within ecological limits is part of the jigsaw puzzle of finding development pathways that allow us to live in harmony with nature.


2. Investing in our natural capital Protected areas:
In order to live in harmony with nature we also need to invest in it, not take it for granted. A building block of this has to be the adequate protection of representative areas of our forests, freshwater areas and oceans. The current Convention on Biological Diversity



(CBD) target of 10 per cent protection for each ecological region has only been achieved in approximately 55 per cent of all terrestrial ecoregions. Further, particular emphasis needs to be placed on those two-thirds of the oceans which lie beyond national jurisdictions.
How much space should be set aside to conserve biodiversity, not just for carbon storage and the maintenance of ecosystem services, but also for the inherent ethical reasons that have guided the principles of sustainable development? WWF and many other organizations believe that a 15 per cent target should be the minimum. This new target is important as protected areas will play an increasing role in building resilience to climate change. We are already on a pathway to temperature increases that will require extra space for the evolution of nature and the migration of species.

Biome-based imperatives: Yet creating protected areas will not be enough. The three biomes of forests, freshwater and oceans have their own particular challenges.

ZERO
A worldwide effort to achieve zero net
deforestation

Forests: Deforestation continues at an alarming rate. At the CBD 9th Conference of the Parties (COP 9) in Bonn in 2008, 67 ministers signed up to achieving zero net deforestation by 2020. Now we need a worldwide effort involving traditional means (protected areas), new initiatives (REDD+) and market mechanisms (best practice in commodity supply chains) to bring this about.

eliminate
overfishing and destructive fishing practices

Freshwater: We need to manage freshwater systems with the aim of providing for human needs and freshwater ecosystems. This means better policies for keeping water use within nature's limits and avoiding the fragmentation of freshwater systems. It also means providing everyone with water as a basic human right, creating agricultural systems that optimize water without impacting the watershed, and designing and operating dams and other in-stream infrastructure to better balance nature and humanity's needs.
Marine: Overcapacity of fishing fleets, and, from that, overexploitation, is the main pressure on marine fisheries globally, leading to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem structure. The overfishing includes the indiscriminate capture of non-target marine life, typically referred to as bycatch and/or discards. In the short term, we need to reduce the capacity of commercial fishing




fleets in order to bring fishing into balance with sustainable harvesting levels. As populations then recover this should permit higher, longer-term harvesting catches.

Investment in biocapacity:
Complementary to investment in the direct protection of nature, we need to invest in biocapacity. Options for enhancing land productivity include restoring degraded land and improving land tenure, land management, crop management and crop yield.
Here, markets have a role to play. Better management practices for the production of crops increase the efficiency of production, thus helping to increase biocapacity as well as reduce the Ecological Footprint. This is complemented by certification schemes (such as those run by the Forest Stewardship Council and Marine Stewardship Council) for sustainable production practices that maintain ecosystem integrity and long-term productivity. By involving companies at different points along the supply chain, market mechanisms help to connect sustainable producers to domestic or international markets and influence industry-scale behaviour. Whilst this behaviour is voluntary, the ultimate goal should be to transform markets so that environmental sustainability is no longer a choice but a value embedded in every product available to consumers.

Enhance land productivity

Valuing biodiversity and ecosystem services:
To facilitate this investment we need a proper system for measuring the value of nature. Governments can account for ecosystem services in cost-benefit analyses that guide land-use policies and development permits. We must start with the measurement of the economic value of biodiversity and ecosystem services by governments. This would be the first step to providing new additional financing for biodiversity conservation, which in turn would lead to a new impetus for the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services, including roles for local communities and indigenous peoples.
Companies can act in a similar way to make better longer-term sustainable investment decisions. We need to move to a situation where products include the costs of externalities -- such as water, carbon storage and restoring degraded ecosystems -- in their price. Voluntary certification schemes are one way of achieving this. Users can be expected to invest in long-term sustainable management of resources as long as resources have

Develop valuation tools to distinguish between the evaluation and the appreciation of nature



a clear future value, and as long as they are assured of continued access to, and substantial benefits from, those resources in the future.

Equalise food aspirations

3. Energy and food
Our scenario modelling has highlighted two big issues for the future that we need to focus on: energy and food.
In a new energy analysis WWF is undertaking, we show how the provision of clean renewable energy for all is possible. This will involve investing in energy-efficient buildings and transport systems that consume less energy, and shifting to electricity as a primary energy source as this facilitates the supply of renewable energy. We believe it is possible not only to increase access to clean energy for those who currently rely on fuelwood, but to virtually eliminate the reliance on fossil fuels, thereby cutting carbon emissions dramatically. This will involve investing in technology and innovation to make production more energy efficient. It will also create a whole new era of green jobs.
Food is set to be the next major issue for the world -- not just tackling malnutrition and over-consumption, but also ensuring equitable access to food and revising our aspirations regarding the food we eat. This is part of the debate on development pathways that countries will need to follow. It will play out also in debates on how we allocate the productive land.

?
We will be faced with land allocation dilemmas

4. Land allocation and land-use planning
Will there be enough land for us to produce the food, feed and fuel for our needs in the future? And will there also be enough land available to conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services?
The FAO has estimated that an increase of 70 per cent in food production is required to feed the future global population (FAO, 2009). It has concluded that there is enough land. Yet in order to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels we will also need to allocate significant areas of land and forests for biofuels and biomaterials.
Our work on the ground across the world has provided us with the insight that in reality there are likely to be many constraints to making more land available or to raising yields: land tenure rights for small communities and indigenous peoples, land ownership questions, a lack of infrastructure, and water availability are just some of the factors that will restrict the amount of land available for growing crops.




A further tension will be the strategic direction that governments of countries with high and low levels of biocapacity take. For example, Canada and Australia have high biocapacity per person and have the opportunity to use and consume more, or to export their ""excess"". Countries like Singapore or the UK have a deficit that can only be met by relying on the productivity of other countries' resources.
Biocapacity has already become a geopolitical issue. The grab for land and water which is happening especially in Africa is a natural though worrying response to concerns about biocapacity. We will need new tools and processes for managing and deciding upon these competing demands on land.

5. Sharing limited resources/inequality
These tools and processes will need to guarantee equitable access to and distribution of energy, water and food across nations and peoples. The failure of the Copenhagen climate conference in December 2009 and the scrambles by individual governments to secure water, land, oil and minerals illustrate the difficulties of reaching international agreement on such issues. One idea is to consider national ""budgets"" for our key resources. For example, allocating a national carbon budget would allow each country to decide at a national level how it would keep greenhouse gas emissions within safe limits. The logic behind the concept of carbon budgets could serve as a useful starting point for discussions on the allocation of other resources.
The analysis in this report indicates that the emphasis is on governments, companies and individuals to tackle high levels of consumption. There is a legitimate desire by those on low incomes to consume more, especially in low-income countries. However, a different mindset will be required from the higher-income countries and those across the world with high-consumption lifestyles.
For individuals there are many personal choices ahead, including purchasing more goods produced in a sustainable manner, making fewer journeys and eating less meat. We also need a mindset shift to tackle both wasteful and artificial consumption -- the former associated with individual decisions and the latter driven in part by industry overcapacity.
The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) report has highlighted the perverse nature of subsidies across energy, fisheries and agriculture. When nature is fully accounted for, far from adding value to society, these subsidies have become


drivers of overcapacity which leads to wasteful and artificial consumption as well as the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. These subsidies are therefore harmful to the long-term prosperity of humanity.
6. Institutions, decision-making and governance
Who is going to lead these transformations, and who will take the decisions? Despite decades of international recognition of the need to conserve biodiversity and achieve sustainable development, both these goals remain elusive. This is a failure of governance -- both of institutions and of regulation -- a failure of governments and a failure of the market.
There are emerging solutions, at both national and local levels. Far-sighted governments will see the opportunity to gain national economic and societal competitiveness through approaches such as valuing nature and allocating resources in a manner that provides societal prosperity and resilience. This is likely to also involve investments in local governance involving multi-stakeholder groups formed to tackle specific issues, such as the management of and equitable access to resources. There are already some examples of this in action, for example in the regency of Merauke in Papua, Indonesia, where ecosystem and communitybased spatial planning has formal status (WWF-Indonesia, 2009).
Yet national-level efforts will not be enough. International collective action will also be needed to tackle global issues such as subsidies and global inequality. Developing mechanisms at the international level can help ensure the coordination of local, regional and sector-specific solutions. International action is also needed to develop financing mechanisms to facilitate the changes needed.
Businesses also have a role to play, both nationally and internationally, in strengthening governance through engagement in voluntary measures (such as roundtables and certification) and working with civil society and governments to ensure that such voluntary governance mechanisms are more formally recognized. More important is their ability to use the power of the market to drive change, based upon the recognition that natural assets are different from created assets.

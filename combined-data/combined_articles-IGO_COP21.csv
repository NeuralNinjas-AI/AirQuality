IPCC-2013-5.txt,"1 A. Introduction  The Working Group I contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) considers new evidence of climate change  based on many independent scientific analyses from observations of the climate system, paleoclimate archives, theoretical    studies of climate processes and simulations using climate models. It builds upon the Working Group I contribution to the  IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), and incorporates subsequent new findings of research. As a component of the  fifth assessment cycle, the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate  Change Adaptation (SREX) is an important basis for information on changing weather and climate extremes.  This Summary for Policymakers () follows the structure of the Working Group I report. The narrative is supported by a series of overarching highlighted conclusions which, taken together, provide a concise summary. Main sections are introduced with a brief paragraph in italics which outlines the methodological basis of the assessment.  The degree of certainty in key findings in this assessment is based on the author teams' evaluations of underlying scientific understanding and is expressed as a qualitative level of confidence (from very low to very high) and, when possible, probabilistically with a quantified likelihood (from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain). Confidence in the validity of a finding is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g., data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement1. Probabilistic estimates of quantified measures of uncertainty in a finding are based on statistical analysis of observations or model results, or both, and expert judgment2. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers. (See Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details about the specific language the IPCC uses to communicate uncertainty).  The basis for substantive paragraphs in this Summary for Policymakers can be found in the chapter sections of the underlying report and in the Technical Summary. These references are given in curly brackets.  B. Observed Changes in the Climate System Observations of the climate system are based on direct measurements and remote sensing from satellites and other platforms. Global-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th century for temperature and other variables, with more comprehensive and diverse sets of observations available for the period 1950 onwards. Paleoclimate reconstructions extend some records back hundreds to millions of years. Together, they provide a comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere, and the land surface. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased (see Figures .1, .2, .3 and .4). {2.2, 2.4, 3.2, 3.7, 4.2-4.7, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5-5.6, 6.2, 13.2}  1 In this Summary for Policymakers, the following summary terms are used to describe the available evidence: limited, medium, or robust; and for the degree of agreement: low, medium, or high. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high, and typeset in italics, e.g., medium confidence. For a given evidence and agreement statement, different confidence levels can be assigned, but increasing levels of evidence and degrees of agreement are correlated with increasing confidence (see Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details). 2 In this Summary for Policymakers, the following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1%. Additional terms (extremely likely: 95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, and extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, e.g., very likely (see Chapter 1 and Box TS.1 for more details).    B.1 Atmosphere  Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any  preceding decade since 1850 (see Figure .1). In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983- was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (medium confidence). {2.4, 5.3}    - The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend, show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] -C3, over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist. The total increase between the average of the 1850-1900 period and the 2003-2012 period is 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] -C, based on the single longest dataset available4 (see Figure .1). {2.4} - For the longest period when calculation of regional trends is sufficiently complete (1901 to 2012), almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming (see Figure .1). {2.4} - In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability (see Figure .1). Due to natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years (1998-2012; 0.05 [-0.05 to 0.15] -C per decade), which begins with a strong El Ni-o, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951-2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] -C per decade)5. {2.4} - Continental-scale surface temperature reconstructions show, with high confidence, multi-decadal periods during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (year 950 to 1250) that were in some regions as warm as in the late 20th century. These regional warm periods did not occur as coherently across regions as the warming in the late 20th century (high confidence). {5.5} - It is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed since the mid-20th century. More complete observations allow greater confidence in estimates of tropospheric temperature changes in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere than elsewhere. There is medium confidence in the rate of warming and its vertical structure in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical troposphere and low confidence elsewhere. {2.4} - Confidence in precipitation change averaged over global land areas since 1901 is low prior to 1951 and medium afterwards. Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium confidence before and high confidence after 1951). For other latitudes area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low confidence (see Figure .2). {TS TFE.1, Figure 2; 2.5} - Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950 (see Table .1 for details). It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale6. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. The frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents, confidence in changes in heavy precipitation events is at most medium. {2.6}  3 In the WGI contribution to the AR5, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty intervals unless otherwise stated. The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets, is expected to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. Uncertainty intervals are not necessarily symmetric about the corresponding best estimate. A best estimate of that value is also given where available. 4 Both methods presented in this bullet were also used in AR4. The first calculates the difference using a best fit linear trend of all points between 1880 and 2012. The second calculates the difference between averages for the two periods 1850-1900 and 2003-2012. Therefore, the resulting values and their 90% uncertainty intervals are not directly comparable. {2.4} 5 Trends for 15-year periods starting in 1995, 1996, and 1997 are 0.13 [0.02 to 0.24] -C per decade, 0.14 [0.03 to 0.24] -C per decade, and, 0.07 [-0.02 to 0.18] -C per decade, respectively. 6 See the Glossary for the definition of these terms: cold days/cold nights, warm days/warm nights, heat waves.  Figure .1 | (a) Observed global mean combined land and ocean surface temperature anomalies, from 1850 to 2012 from three data sets. Top panel: annual mean values. Bottom panel: decadal mean values including the estimate of uncertainty for one dataset (black). Anomalies are relative to the mean of 1961-1990. (b) Map of the observed surface temperature change from 1901 to 2012 derived from temperature trends determined by linear regression from one dataset (orange line in panel a). Trends have been calculated where data availability permits a robust estimate (i.e., only for grid boxes with greater than 70% complete records and more than 20% data availability in the first and last 10% of the time period). Other areas are white. Grid boxes where the trend is significant at the 10% level are indicated by a + sign. For a listing of the datasets and further technical details see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. {Figures 2.19-2.21; Figure TS.2}   Table .1 | Extreme weather and climate events: Global-scale assessment of recent observed changes, human contribution to the changes, and projected further changes for the early (2016-2035) and late (2081-2100) 21st century. Bold indicates where the AR5 (black) provides a revised* global-scale assessment from the SREX (blue) or AR4 (red). Projections for early 21st century were not provided in previous assessment reports. Projections in the AR5 are relative to the reference period of 1986-2005, and use the new Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (see Box .1) unless otherwise specified. See the Glossary for definitions of extreme weather and climate events.   * The direct comparison of assessment findings between reports is difficult. For some climate variables, different aspects have been assessed, and the revised guidance note on uncertainties has been used for the SREX and AR5. The availability of new information, improved scientific understanding, continued analyses of data and models, and specific differences in methodologies applied in the assessed studies, all contribute to revised assessment findings. Notes: a Attribution is based on available case studies. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of some observed heat waves in some locations. b Models project near-term increases in the duration, intensity and spatial extent of heat waves and warm spells. c In most continents, confidence in trends is not higher than medium except in North America and Europe where there have been likely increases in either the frequency or intensity of heavy precipitation with some seasonal and/or regional variation. It is very likely that there have been increases in central North America. d The frequency and intensity of drought has likely increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa, and likely decreased in central North America and north-west Australia. e AR4 assessed the area affected by drought. f SREX assessed medium confidence that anthropogenic influence had contributed to some changes in the drought patterns observed in the second half of the 20th century, based on its attributed impact on precipitation and temperature changes. SREX assessed low confidence in the attribution of changes in droughts at the level of single regions. g There is low confidence in projected changes in soil moisture. h Regional to global-scale projected decreases in soil moisture and increased agricultural drought are likely (medium confidence) in presently dry regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, Southwest US and southern African regions is consistent with projected changes in Hadley circulation and increased surface temperatures, so there is high confidence in likely surface drying in these regions by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. i There is medium confidence that a reduction in aerosol forcing over the North Atlantic has contributed at least in part to the observed increase in tropical cyclone activity since the 1970s in this region. j Based on expert judgment and assessment of projections which use an SRES A1B (or similar) scenario. k Attribution is based on the close relationship between observed changes in extreme and mean sea level. l There is high confidence that this increase in extreme high sea level will primarily be the result of an increase in mean sea level. There is low confidence in region-specific projections of storminess and associated storm surges. m SREX assessed it to be very likely that mean sea level rise will contribute to future upward trends in extreme coastal high water levels.   B.2 Ocean  Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010 (see Figure .3), and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971. {3.2, Box 3.1}  - On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] -C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. Since AR4, instrumental biases in upper-ocean temperature records have been identified and reduced, enhancing confidence in the assessment of change. {3.2} - It is likely that the ocean warmed between 700 and 2000 m from 1957 to 2009. Sufficient observations are available for the period 1992 to 2005 for a global assessment of temperature change below 2000 m. There were likely no significant observed temperature trends between 2000 and 3000 m for this period. It is likely that the ocean warmed from 3000 m to the bottom for this period, with the largest warming observed in the Southern Ocean. {3.2} - More than 60% of the net energy increase in the climate system is stored in the upper ocean (0-700 m) during the relatively well-sampled 40-year period from 1971 to 2010, and about 30% is stored in the ocean below 700 m. The increase in upper ocean heat content during this time period estimated from a linear trend is likely 17 [15 to 19] - 1022 J 7 (see Figure .3). {3.2, Box 3.1} - It is about as likely as not that ocean heat content from 0-700 m increased more slowly during 2003 to 2010 than during 1993 to 2002 (see Figure .3). Ocean heat uptake from 700-2000 m, where interannual variability is smaller, likely continued unabated from 1993 to 2009. {3.2, Box 9.2} - It is very likely that regions of high salinity where evaporation dominates have become more saline, while regions of low salinity where precipitation dominates have become fresher since the 1950s. These regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence that evaporation and precipitation over the oceans have changed (medium confidence). {2.5, 3.3, 3.5} - There is no observational evidence of a trend in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), based on the decade-long record of the complete AMOC and longer records of individual AMOC components. {3.6} 7 A constant supply of heat through the ocean surface at the rate of 1 W m-2 for 1 year would increase the ocean heat content by 1.1 - 1022 J.    B.3 Cryosphere  Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass,  glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern  Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence) (see    Figure .3). {4.2-4.7}  - The average rate of ice loss8 from glaciers around the world, excluding glaciers on the periphery of the ice sheets9, was very likely 226 [91 to 361] Gt yr-1 over the period 1971 to 2009, and very likely 275 [140 to 410] Gt yr-1 over the period 1993 to 200910. {4.3} - The average rate of ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet has very likely substantially increased from 34 [-6 to 74] Gt yr-1 over the period 1992 to 2001 to 215 [157 to 274] Gt yr-1 over the period 2002 to 2011. {4.4} - The average rate of ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet has likely increased from 30 [-37 to 97] Gt yr-1 over the period 1992-2001 to 147 [72 to 221] Gt yr-1 over the period 2002 to 2011. There is very high confidence that these losses are mainly from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. {4.4} - The annual mean Arctic sea ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012 with a rate that was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade (range of 0.45 to 0.51 million km2 per decade), and very likely in the range 9.4 to 13.6% per decade (range of 0.73 to 1.07 million km2 per decade) for the summer sea ice minimum (perennial sea ice). The average decrease in decadal mean extent of Arctic sea ice has been most rapid in summer (high confidence); the spatial extent has decreased in every season, and in every successive decade since 1979 (high confidence) (see Figure .3). There is medium confidence from reconstructions that over the past three decades, Arctic summer sea ice retreat was unprecedented and sea surface temperatures were anomalously high in at least the last 1,450 years. {4.2, 5.5} - It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased at a rate in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade (range of 0.13 to 0.20 million km2 per decade) between 1979 and 2012. There is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in this annual rate, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. {4.2} - There is very high confidence that the extent of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th century (see Figure .3). Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent decreased 1.6 [0.8 to 2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7 [8.8 to 14.6] % per decade for June, over the 1967 to 2012 period. During this period, snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere did not show a statistically significant increase in any month. {4.5} - There is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s. Observed warming was up to 3-C in parts of Northern Alaska (early 1980s to mid-2000s) and up to 2-C in parts of the Russian European North (1971 to 2010). In the latter region, a considerable reduction in permafrost thickness and areal extent has been observed over the period 1975 to 2005 (medium confidence). {4.7} - Multiple lines of evidence support very substantial Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. {Box 5.1, 10.3}   B.4 Sea Level  The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate  during the previous two millennia (high confidence). Over the period 1901 to 2010, global  mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m (see Figure .3). {3.7, 5.6, 13.2}    - Proxy and instrumental sea level data indicate a transition in the late 19th to the early 20th century from relatively low mean rates of rise over the previous two millennia to higher rates of rise (high confidence). It is likely that the rate of global mean sea level rise has continued to increase since the early 20th century. {3.7, 5.6, 13.2} - It is very likely that the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm yr-1 between 1901 and 2010, 2.0 [1.7 to 2.3] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2010, and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2010. Tide-gauge and satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate of the latter period. It is likely that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950. {3.7} - Since the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion from warming together explain about 75% of the observed global mean sea level rise (high confidence). Over the period 1993 to 2010, global mean sea level rise is, with high confidence, consistent with the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion due to warming (1.1 [0.8 to 1.4] mm yr-1), from changes in glaciers (0.76 [0.39 to 1.13] mm yr-1), Greenland ice sheet (0.33 [0.25 to 0.41] mm yr-1), Antarctic ice sheet (0.27 [0.16 to 0.38] mm yr-1), and land water storage (0.38 [0.26 to 0.49] mm yr-1). The sum of these contributions is 2.8 [2.3 to 3.4] mm yr-1. {13.3} - There is very high confidence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial period (129,000 to 116,000 years ago) was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present, and high confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the last interglacial period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m to the higher global mean sea level, implying with medium confidence an additional contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature, averaged over several thousand years, at least 2-C warmer than present (high confidence). {5.3, 5.6}  B.5 Carbon and Other Biogeochemical Cycles  The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and secondarily from net land use change emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification (see Figure .4). {2.2, 3.8, 5.2, 6.2, 6.3}  - The atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) have all increased since 1750 due to human activity. In 2011 the concentrations of these greenhouse gases were 391 ppm11, 1803 ppb, and 324 ppb, and exceeded the pre-industrial levels by about 40%, 150%, and 20%, respectively. {2.2, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2} - Concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O now substantially exceed the highest concentrations recorded in ice cores during the past 800,000 years. The mean rates of increase in atmospheric concentrations over the past century are, with very high confidence, unprecedented in the last 22,000 years. {5.2, 6.1, 6.2}     - Annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production were 8.3 [7.6 to 9.0] GtC12 yr-1 averaged over 2002-2011 (high confidence) and were 9.5 [8.7 to 10.3] GtC yr-1 in 2011, 54% above the 1990 level. Annual net CO2 emissions from anthropogenic land use change were 0.9 [0.1 to 1.7] GtC yr-1 on average during 2002 to 2011 (medium confidence). {6.3}   C. Drivers of Climate Change  Natural and anthropogenic substances and processes that alter the Earth's energy budget are drivers of climate change.  Radiative forcing14 (RF) quantifies the change in energy fluxes caused by changes in these drivers for 2011 relative to 1750,  unless otherwise indicated. Positive RF leads to surface warming, negative RF leads to surface cooling. RF is estimated based  on in-situ and remote observations, properties of greenhouse gases and aerosols, and calculations using numerical models    representing observed processes. Some emitted compounds affect the atmospheric concentration of other substances. The RF  can be reported based on the concentration changes of each substance15. Alternatively, the emission-based RF of a compound  can be reported, which provides a more direct link to human activities. It includes contributions from all substances affected  by that emission. The total anthropogenic RF of the two approaches are identical when considering all drivers. Though both  approaches are used in this Summary for Policymakers, emission-based RFs are emphasized.  Total radiative forcing is positive, and has led to an uptake of energy by the climate system. The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 since 1750 (see Figure .5). {3.2, Box 3.1, 8.3, 8.5}  - The total anthropogenic RF for 2011 relative to 1750 is 2.29 [1.13 to 3.33] W m-2 (see Figure .5), and it has increased more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. The total anthropogenic RF best estimate for 2011 is 43% higher than that reported in AR4 for the year 2005. This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most greenhouse gas concentrations and improved estimates of RF by aerosols indicating a weaker net cooling effect (negative RF). {8.5} - The RF from emissions of well-mixed greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, and Halocarbons) for 2011 relative to 1750 is 3.00 [2.22 to 3.78] W m-2 (see Figure .5). The RF from changes in concentrations in these gases is 2.83 [2.26 to 3.40] W m-2. {8.5} - Emissions of CO2 alone have caused an RF of 1.68 [1.33 to 2.03] W m-2 (see Figure .5). Including emissions of other carbon-containing gases, which also contributed to the increase in CO2 concentrations, the RF of CO2 is 1.82 [1.46 to 2.18] W m-2. {8.3, 8.5} - Emissions of CH4 alone have caused an RF of 0.97 [0.74 to 1.20] W m-2 (see Figure .5). This is much larger than the concentration-based estimate of 0.48 [0.38 to 0.58] W m-2 (unchanged from AR4). This difference in estimates is caused by concentration changes in ozone and stratospheric water vapour due to CH4 emissions and other emissions indirectly affecting CH4. {8.3, 8.5} - Emissions of stratospheric ozone-depleting halocarbons have caused a net positive RF of 0.18 [0.01 to 0.35] W m-2 (see Figure .5). Their own positive RF has outweighed the negative RF from the ozone depletion that they have induced. The positive RF from all halocarbons is similar to the value in AR4, with a reduced RF from CFCs but increases from many of their substitutes. {8.3, 8.5} - Emissions of short-lived gases contribute to the total anthropogenic RF. Emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) are virtually certain to have induced a positive RF, while emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are likely to have induced a net negative RF (see Figure .5). {8.3, 8.5} - The RF of the total aerosol effect in the atmosphere, which includes cloud adjustments due to aerosols, is -0.9 [-1.9 to -0.1] W m-2 (medium confidence), and results from a negative forcing from most aerosols and a positive contribution    from black carbon absorption of solar radiation. There is high confidence that aerosols and their interactions with clouds have offset a substantial portion of global mean forcing from well-mixed greenhouse gases. They continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to the total RF estimate. {7.5, 8.3, 8.5}  - The forcing from stratospheric volcanic aerosols can have a large impact on the climate for some years after volcanic    eruptions. Several small eruptions have caused an RF of -0.11 [-0.15 to -0.08] W m-2 for the years 2008 to 2011, which  is approximately twice as strong as during the years 1999 to 2002. {8.4}  - The RF due to changes in solar irradiance is estimated as 0.05 [0.00 to 0.10] W m-2 (see Figure .5). Satellite observations of total solar irradiance changes from 1978 to 2011 indicate that the last solar minimum was lower than the previous two. This results in an RF of -0.04 [-0.08 to 0.00] W m-2 between the most recent minimum in 2008 and the 1986 minimum. {8.4}  - The total natural RF from solar irradiance changes and stratospheric volcanic aerosols made only a small contribution to the net radiative forcing throughout the last century, except for brief periods after large volcanic eruptions. {8.5}    Figure .5 | Radiative forcing estimates in 2011 relative to 1750 and aggregated uncertainties for the main drivers of climate change. Values are global average radiative forcing (RF14), partitioned according to the emitted compounds or processes that result in a combination of drivers. The best estimates of the net radiative forcing are shown as black diamonds with corresponding uncertainty intervals; the numerical values are provided on the right of the figure, together with the confidence level in the net forcing (VH - very high, H - high, M - medium, L - low, VL - very low). Albedo forcing due to black carbon on snow and ice is included in the black carbon aerosol bar. Small forcings due to contrails (0.05 W m-2, including contrail induced cirrus), and HFCs, PFCs and SF6 (total 0.03 W m-2) are not shown. Concentration-based RFs for gases can be obtained by summing the like-coloured bars. Volcanic forcing is not included as its episodic nature makes is difficult to compare to other forcing mechanisms. Total anthropogenic radiative forcing is provided for three different years relative to 1750. For further technical details, including uncertainty ranges associated with individual components and processes, see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. {8.5; Figures 8.14-8.18; Figures TS.6 and TS.7}     D. Understanding the Climate System and its Recent Changes  Understanding recent changes in the climate system results from combining observations, studies of feedback processes, and  model simulations. Evaluation of the ability of climate models to simulate recent changes requires consideration of the state  of all modelled climate system components at the start of the simulation and the natural and anthropogenic forcing used to  drive the models. Compared to AR4, more detailed and longer observations and improved climate models now enable the    attribution of a human contribution to detected changes in more climate system components.  Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system. {2-14}  D.1 Evaluation of Climate Models Climate models have improved since the AR4. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high confidence). {9.4, 9.6, 9.8} - The long-term climate model simulations show a trend in global-mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2012 that agrees with the observed trend (very high confidence). There are, however, differences between simulated and observed trends over periods as short as 10 to 15 years (e.g., 1998 to 2012). {9.4, Box 9.2} - The observed reduction in surface warming trend over the period 1998 to 2012 as compared to the period 1951 to 2012, is due in roughly equal measure to a reduced trend in radiative forcing and a cooling contribution from natural internal variability, which includes a possible redistribution of heat within the ocean (medium confidence). The reduced trend in radiative forcing is primarily due to volcanic eruptions and the timing of the downward phase of the 11-year solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of changes in radiative forcing in causing the reduced warming trend. There is medium confidence that natural internal decadal variability causes to a substantial degree the difference between observations and the simulations; the latter are not expected to reproduce the timing of natural internal variability. There may also be a contribution from forcing inadequacies and, in some models, an overestimate of the response to increasing greenhouse gas and other anthropogenic forcing (dominated by the effects of aerosols). {9.4, Box 9.2, 10.3, Box 10.2, 11.3} - On regional scales, the confidence in model capability to simulate surface temperature is less than for the larger scales. However, there is high confidence that regional-scale surface temperature is better simulated than at the time of the AR4. {9.4, 9.6} - There has been substantial progress in the assessment of extreme weather and climate events since AR4. Simulated global-mean trends in the frequency of extreme warm and cold days and nights over the second half of the 20th century are generally consistent with observations. {9.5} - There has been some improvement in the simulation of continental-scale patterns of precipitation since the AR4. At regional scales, precipitation is not simulated as well, and the assessment is hampered by observational uncertainties. {9.4, 9.6} - Some important climate phenomena are now better reproduced by models. There is high confidence that the statistics of monsoon and El Ni-o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) based on multi-model simulations have improved since AR4. {9.5}     - Climate models now include more cloud and aerosol processes, and their interactions, than at the time of the AR4, but there remains low confidence in the representation and quantification of these processes in models. {7.3, 7.6, 9.4, 9.7}  - There is robust evidence that the downward trend in Arctic summer sea ice extent since 1979 is now reproduced by more  models than at the time of the AR4, with about one-quarter of the models showing a trend as large as, or larger than,    the trend in the observations. Most models simulate a small downward trend in Antarctic sea ice extent, albeit with large  inter-model spread, in contrast to the small upward trend in observations. {9.4}  - Many models reproduce the observed changes in upper-ocean heat content (0-700 m) from 1961 to 2005 (high confidence), with the multi-model mean time series falling within the range of the available observational estimates for most of the period. {9.4}  - Climate models that include the carbon cycle (Earth System Models) simulate the global pattern of ocean-atmosphere CO2 fluxes, with outgassing in the tropics and uptake in the mid and high latitudes. In the majority of these models the sizes of the simulated global land and ocean carbon sinks over the latter part of the 20th century are within the range of observational estimates. {9.4}  D.2 Quantification of Climate System Responses  Observational and model studies of temperature change, climate feedbacks and changes in the Earth's energy budget together provide confidence in the magnitude of global warming in response to past and future forcing. {Box 12.2, Box 13.1}  - The net feedback from the combined effect of changes in water vapour, and differences between atmospheric and surface warming is extremely likely positive and therefore amplifies changes in climate. The net radiative feedback due to all cloud types combined is likely positive. Uncertainty in the sign and magnitude of the cloud feedback is due primarily to continuing uncertainty in the impact of warming on low clouds. {7.2} - The equilibrium climate sensitivity quantifies the response of the climate system to constant radiative forcing on multicentury time scales. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at equilibrium that is caused by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely in the range 1.5-C to 4.5-C (high confidence), extremely unlikely less than 1-C (high confidence), and very unlikely greater than 6-C (medium confidence)16. The lower temperature limit of the assessed likely range is thus less than the 2-C in the AR4, but the upper limit is the same. This assessment reflects improved understanding, the extended temperature record in the atmosphere and ocean, and new estimates of radiative forcing. {TS TFE.6, Figure 1; Box 12.2} - The rate and magnitude of global climate change is determined by radiative forcing, climate feedbacks and the storage of energy by the climate system. Estimates of these quantities for recent decades are consistent with the assessed likely range of the equilibrium climate sensitivity to within assessed uncertainties, providing strong evidence for our understanding of anthropogenic climate change. {Box 12.2, Box 13.1} - The transient climate response quantifies the response of the climate system to an increasing radiative forcing on a decadal to century timescale. It is defined as the change in global mean surface temperature at the time when the atmospheric CO2 concentration has doubled in a scenario of concentration increasing at 1% per year. The transient climate response is likely in the range of 1.0-C to 2.5-C (high confidence) and extremely unlikely greater than 3-C. {Box 12.2} - A related quantity is the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). It quantifies the transient response of the climate system to cumulative carbon emissions (see Section E.8). TCRE is defined as the global mean    surface temperature change per 1000 GtC emitted to the atmosphere. TCRE is likely in the range of 0.8-C to 2.5-C per 1000 GtC and applies for cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC until the time temperatures peak (see Figure .10). {12.5, Box 12.2}  - Various metrics can be used to compare the contributions to climate change of emissions of different substances. The  most appropriate metric and time horizon will depend on which aspects of climate change are considered most important to a particular application. No single metric can accurately compare all consequences of different emissions, and all have    limitations and uncertainties. The Global Warming Potential is based on the cumulative radiative forcing over a particular  time horizon, and the Global Temperature Change Potential is based on the change in global mean surface temperature  at a chosen point in time. Updated values are provided in the underlying Report. {8.7}  D.3 Detection and Attribution of Climate Change  Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes (see Figure .6 and Table .1). This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. {10.3-10.6, 10.9}  - It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. {10.3} - Greenhouse gases contributed a global mean surface warming likely to be in the range of 0.5-C to 1.3-C over the period 1951 to 2010, with the contributions from other anthropogenic forcings, including the cooling effect of aerosols, likely to be in the range of -0.6-C to 0.1-C. The contribution from natural forcings is likely to be in the range of -0.1-C to 0.1-C, and from natural internal variability is likely to be in the range of -0.1-C to 0.1-C. Together these assessed contributions are consistent with the observed warming of approximately 0.6-C to 0.7-C over this period. {10.3} - Over every continental region except Antarctica, anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century (see Figure .6). For Antarctica, large observational uncertainties result in low confidence that anthropogenic forcings have contributed to the observed warming averaged over available stations. It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to the very substantial Arctic warming since the mid-20th century. {2.4, 10.3} - It is very likely that anthropogenic influence, particularly greenhouse gases and stratospheric ozone depletion, has led to a detectable observed pattern of tropospheric warming and a corresponding cooling in the lower stratosphere since 1961. {2.4, 9.4, 10.3} - It is very likely that anthropogenic forcings have made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0-700 m) observed since the 1970s (see Figure .6). There is evidence for human influence in some individual ocean basins. {3.2, 10.4} - It is likely that anthropogenic influences have affected the global water cycle since 1960. Anthropogenic influences have contributed to observed increases in atmospheric moisture content in the atmosphere (medium confidence), to global-scale changes in precipitation patterns over land (medium confidence), to intensification of heavy precipitation over land regions where data are sufficient (medium confidence), and to changes in surface and sub-surface ocean salinity (very likely). {2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 7.6, 10.3, 10.4}  Figure .6 | Comparison of observed and simulated climate change based on three large-scale indicators in the atmosphere, the cryosphere and the ocean: change in continental land surface air temperatures (yellow panels), Arctic and Antarctic September sea ice extent (white panels), and upper ocean heat content in the major ocean basins (blue panels). Global average changes are also given. Anomalies are given relative to 1880-1919 for surface temperatures, 1960-1980 for ocean heat content and 1979-1999 for sea ice. All time-series are decadal averages, plotted at the centre of the decade. For temperature panels, observations are dashed lines if the spatial coverage of areas being examined is below 50%. For ocean heat content and sea ice panels the solid line is where the coverage of data is good and higher in quality, and the dashed line is where the data coverage is only adequate, and thus, uncertainty is larger. Model results shown are Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble ranges, with shaded bands indicating the 5 to 95% confidence intervals. For further technical details, including region definitions see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. {Figure 10.21; Figure TS.12}     - There has been further strengthening of the evidence for human influence on temperature extremes since the SREX. It is now very likely that human influence has contributed to observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century, and likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations (see Table .1). {10.6}  - Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea ice loss since 1979. There is low confidence in the    scientific understanding of the small observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent due to the incomplete and competing  scientific explanations for the causes of change and low confidence in estimates of natural internal variability in that  region (see Figure .6). {10.5}  - Anthropogenic influences likely contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Due to a low level of scientific understanding there is low confidence in attributing the causes of the observed loss of mass from the Antarctic ice sheet over the past two decades. {4.3, 10.5}  - It is likely that there has been an anthropogenic contribution to observed reductions in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1970. {10.5}  - It is very likely that there is a substantial anthropogenic contribution to the global mean sea level rise since the 1970s. This is based on the high confidence in an anthropogenic influence on the two largest contributions to sea level rise, that is thermal expansion and glacier mass loss. {10.4, 10.5, 13.3}  - There is high confidence that changes in total solar irradiance have not contributed to the increase in global mean surface temperature over the period 1986 to 2008, based on direct satellite measurements of total solar irradiance. There is medium confidence that the 11-year cycle of solar variability influences decadal climate fluctuations in some regions. No robust association between changes in cosmic rays and cloudiness has been identified. {7.4, 10.3, Box 10.2}  E. Future Global and Regional Climate Change Projections of changes in the climate system are made using a hierarchy of climate models ranging from simple climate models, to models of intermediate complexity, to comprehensive climate models, and Earth System Models. These models simulate changes based on a set of scenarios of anthropogenic forcings. A new set of scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), was used for the new climate model simulations carried out under the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) of the World Climate Research Programme. In all RCPs, atmospheric CO2 concentrations are higher in 2100 relative to present day as a result of a further increase of cumulative emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere during the 21st century (see Box .1). Projections in this Summary for Policymakers are for the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) given relative to 1986-2005, unless otherwise stated. To place such projections in historical context, it is necessary to consider observed changes between different periods. Based on the longest global surface temperature dataset available, the observed change between the average of the period 1850-1900 and of the AR5 reference period is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] -C. However, warming has occurred beyond the average of the AR5 reference period. Hence this is not an estimate of historical warming to present (see Chapter 2) . Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. {6, 11-14} - Projections for the next few decades show spatial patterns of climate change similar to those projected for the later 21st century but with smaller magnitude. Natural internal variability will continue to be a major influence on climate, particularly in the near-term and at the regional scale. By the mid-21st century the magnitudes of the projected changes are substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenario (Box .1). {11.3, Box 11.1, Annex I}     - Projected climate change based on RCPs is similar to AR4 in both patterns and magnitude, after accounting for scenario  differences. The overall spread of projections for the high RCPs is narrower than for comparable scenarios used in AR because in contrast to the SRES emission scenarios used in AR4, the RCPs used in AR5 are defined as concentration  pathways and thus carbon cycle uncertainties affecting atmospheric CO2 concentrations are not considered in the concentration-driven CMIP5 simulations. Projections of sea level rise are larger than in the AR4, primarily because of    improved modelling of land-ice contributions.{11.3, 12.3, 12.4, 13.4, 13.5}  E.1 Atmosphere: Temperature  Global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1.5-C relative to 1850 to 1900 for all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. It is likely to exceed 2-C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and more likely than not to exceed 2-C for RCP4.5. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Warming will continue to exhibit interannual-to-decadal variability and will not be regionally uniform (see Figures .7 and .8). {11.3, 12.3, 12.4, 14.8}  - The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016-2035 relative to 1986-2005 will likely be in the range of 0.3-C to 0.7-C (medium confidence). This assessment is based on multiple lines of evidence and assumes there will be no major volcanic eruptions or secular changes in total solar irradiance. Relative to natural internal variability, near-term increases in seasonal mean and annual mean temperatures are expected to be larger in the tropics and subtropics than in mid-latitudes (high confidence). {11.3} - Increase of global mean surface temperatures for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 is projected to likely be in the ranges derived from the concentration-driven CMIP5 model simulations, that is, 0.3-C to 1.7-C (RCP2.6), 1.1-C to 2.6-C (RCP4.5), 1.4-C to 3.1-C (RCP6.0), 2.6-C to 4.8-C (RCP8.5). The Arctic region will warm more rapidly than the global mean, and mean warming over land will be larger than over the ocean (very high confidence) (see Figures .7 and .8, and Table .2). {12.4, 14.8} - Relative to the average from year 1850 to 1900, global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st century is projected to likely exceed 1.5-C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Warming is likely to exceed 2-C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2-C for RCP4.5 (high confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2-C for RCP2.6 (medium confidence). Warming is unlikely to exceed 4-C for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 (high confidence) and is about as likely as not to exceed 4-C for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {12.4} - It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily and seasonal timescales as global mean temperatures increase. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur (see Table .1). {12.4} E.2 Atmosphere: Water Cycle Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions (see Figure .8). {12.4, 14.3}  - Projected changes in the water cycle over the next few decades show similar large-scale patterns to those towards the end of the century, but with smaller magnitude. Changes in the near-term, and at the regional scale will be strongly influenced by natural internal variability and may be affected by anthropogenic aerosol emissions. {11.3}   Figure .7 | CMIP5 multi-model simulated time series from 1950 to 2100 for (a) change in global annual mean surface temperature relative to 1986-2005, (b) Northern Hemisphere September sea ice extent (5-year running mean), and (c) global mean ocean surface pH. Time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6 (blue) and RCP8.5 (red). Black (grey shading) is the modelled historical evolution using historical reconstructed forcings. The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over 2081-2100 are given for all RCP scenarios as colored vertical bars. The numbers of CMIP5 models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated. For sea ice extent (b), the projected mean and uncertainty (minimum-maximum range) of the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979 to 2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice is given (number of models given in brackets). For completeness, the CMIP5 multi-model mean is also indicated with dotted lines. The dashed line represents nearly ice-free conditions (i.e., when sea ice extent is less than 106 km2 for at least five consecutive years). For further technical details see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material {Figures 6.28, 12.5, and 12.28-12.31; Figures TS.15, TS.17, and TS.20}  Figure .8 | Maps of CMIP5 multi-model mean results for the scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in 2081-2100 of (a) annual mean surface temperature change, (b) average percent change in annual mean precipitation, (c) Northern Hemisphere September sea ice extent, and (d) change in ocean surface pH. Changes in panels (a), (b) and (d) are shown relative to 1986-2005. The number of CMIP5 models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel. For panels (a) and (b), hatching indicates regions where the multi-model mean is small compared to natural internal variability (i.e., less than one standard deviation of natural internal variability in 20-year means). Stippling indicates regions where the multi-model mean is large compared to natural internal variability (i.e., greater than two standard deviations of natural internal variability in 20-year means) and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change (see Box 12.1). In panel (c), the lines are the modelled means for 1986-2005; the filled areas are for the end of the century. The CMIP5 multi-model mean is given in white colour, the projected mean sea ice extent of a subset of models (number of models given in brackets) that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979 to 2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice extent is given in light blue colour. For further technical details see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. {Figures 6.28, 12.11, 12.22, and 12.29; Figures TS.15, TS.16, TS.17, and TS.20}    - The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario (see Figure .8). {7.6, 12.4, 14.3} - Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent by the end of this century, as global mean surface temperature increases (see Table .1). {7.6, 12.4} - Globally, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase over the 21st century. While monsoon winds are likely to weaken, monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify due to the increase in atmospheric moisture. Monsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much. Monsoon retreat dates will likely be delayed, resulting in lengthening of the monsoon season in many regions. {14.2} - There is high confidence that the El Ni-o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) will remain the dominant mode of interannual variability in the tropical Pacific, with global effects in the 21st century. Due to the increase in moisture availability, ENSO-related precipitation variability on regional scales will likely intensify. Natural variations of the amplitude and spatial pattern of ENSO are large and thus confidence in any specific projected change in ENSO and related regional phenomena for the 21st century remains low. {5.4, 14.4}  Notes: a Based on the CMIP5 ensemble; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Using HadCRUT4 and its uncertainty estimate (5-95% confidence interval), the observed warming to the reference period 1986-2005 is 0.61 [0.55 to 0.67] -C from 1850-1900, and 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] -C from 1980-1999, the reference period for projections used in AR4. Likely ranges have not been assessed here with respect to earlier reference periods because methods are not generally available in the literature for combining the uncertainties in models and observations. Adding projected and observed changes does not account for potential effects of model biases compared to observations, and for natural internal variability during the observational reference period {2.4; 11.2; Tables 12.2 and 12.3} b Based on 21 CMIP5 models; anomalies calculated with respect to 1986-2005. Where CMIP5 results were not available for a particular AOGCM and scenario, they were estimated as explained in Chapter 13, Table 13.5. The contributions from ice sheet rapid dynamical change and anthropogenic land water storage are treated as having uniform probability distributions, and as largely independent of scenario. This treatment does not imply that the contributions concerned will not depend on the scenario followed, only that the current state of knowledge does not permit a quantitative assessment of the dependence. Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. There is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. c Calculated from projections as 5-95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of confidence in models. For projections of global mean surface temperature change in 2046-2065 confidence is medium, because the relative importance of natural internal variability, and uncertainty in non-greenhouse gas forcing and response, are larger than for 2081-2100. The likely ranges for 2046-2065 do not take into account the possible influence of factors that lead to the assessed range for near-term (2016-2035) global mean surface temperature change that is lower than the 5-95% model range, because the influence of these factors on longer term projections has not been quantified due to insufficient scientific understanding. {11.3} d Calculated from projections as 5-95% model ranges. These ranges are then assessed to be likely ranges after accounting for additional uncertainties or different levels of confidence in models. For projections of global mean sea level rise confidence is medium for both time horizons.     E.3 Atmosphere: Air Quality  - The range in projections of air quality (ozone and PM2.517 in near-surface air) is driven primarily by emissions (including  CH4), rather than by physical climate change (medium confidence). There is high confidence that globally, warming  decreases background surface ozone. High CH4 levels (as in RCP8.5) can offset this decrease, raising background surface    ozone by year 2100 on average by about 8 ppb (25% of current levels) relative to scenarios with small CH4 changes (as  in RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) (high confidence). {11.3}  - Observational and modelling evidence indicates that, all else being equal, locally higher surface temperatures in polluted regions will trigger regional feedbacks in chemistry and local emissions that will increase peak levels of ozone and PM2.5 (medium confidence). For PM2.5, climate change may alter natural aerosol sources as well as removal by precipitation, but no confidence level is attached to the overall impact of climate change on PM2.5 distributions. {11.3}  E.4 Ocean  The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation. {11.3, 12.4}  - The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the warming will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean (high confidence). Best estimates of ocean warming in the top one hundred meters are about 0.6-C (RCP2.6) to 2.0-C (RCP8.5), and about 0.3-C (RCP2.6) to 0.6-C (RCP8.5) at a depth of about 1000 m by the end of the 21st century. {12.4, 14.3} - It is very likely that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will weaken over the 21st century. Best estimates and ranges18 for the reduction are 11% (1 to 24%) in RCP2.6 and 34% (12 to 54%) in RCP8.5. It is likely that there will be some decline in the AMOC by about 2050, but there may be some decades when the AMOC increases due to large natural internal variability. {11.3, 12.4} - It is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century for the scenarios considered. There is low confidence in assessing the evolution of the AMOC beyond the 21st century because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded. {12.5} E.5 Cryosphere It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. Global glacier volume will further decrease. {12.4, 13.4}  - Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice extent are projected by the end of the 21st century from multi-model averages. These reductions range from 43% for RCP2.6 to 94% for RCP8.5 in September and from 8% for RCP2.6 to 34% for RCP8.5 in February (medium confidence) (see Figures .7 and .8). {12.4}  17 PM2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, a measure of atmospheric aerosol concentration. 18 The ranges in this paragraph indicate a CMIP5 model spread.    - Based on an assessment of the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979 to 2012 trend of the Arctic sea ice extent, a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean19 in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.5 (medium confidence) (see Figures .7 and .8). A projection of when the Arctic might become nearly icefree in September in the 21st century cannot be made with confidence for the other scenarios. {11.3, 12.4, 12.5}  - In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice extent and volume is projected with low confidence for the end of the 21st century    as global mean surface temperature rises. {12.4}  - By the end of the 21st century, the global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica, is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6, and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {13.4, 13.5}  - The area of Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover is projected to decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5 by the end of the 21st century for the model average (medium confidence). {12.4}  - It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases. By the end of the 21st century, the area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) is projected to decrease by between 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the model average (medium confidence). {12.4}  E.6 Sea Level  Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century (see Figure .9). Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed that observed during 1971 to 2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets. {13.3-13.5}  - Confidence in projections of global mean sea level rise has increased since the AR4 because of the improved physical understanding of the components of sea level, the improved agreement of process-based models with observations, and the inclusion of ice-sheet dynamical changes. {13.3-13.5} - Global mean sea level rise for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 will likely be in the ranges of 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, 0.32 to 0.63 m for RCP4.5, 0.33 to 0.63 m for RCP6.0, and 0.45 to 0.82 m for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). For RCP8.5, the rise by the year 2100 is 0.52 to 0.98 m, with a rate during 2081 to 2100 of 8 to 16 mm yr-1 (medium confidence). These ranges are derived from CMIP5 climate projections in combination with process-based models and literature assessment of glacier and ice sheet contributions (see Figure .9, Table .2). {13.5} - In the RCP projections, thermal expansion accounts for 30 to 55% of 21st century global mean sea level rise, and glaciers for 15 to 35%. The increase in surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet will exceed the increase in snowfall, leading to a positive contribution from changes in surface mass balance to future sea level (high confidence). While surface melting will remain small, an increase in snowfall on the Antarctic ice sheet is expected (medium confidence), resulting in a negative contribution to future sea level from changes in surface mass balance. Changes in outflow from both ice sheets combined will likely make a contribution in the range of 0.03 to 0.20 m by 2081-2100 (medium confidence). {13.3-13.5} - Based on current understanding, only the collapse of marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet, if initiated, could cause global mean sea level to rise substantially above the likely range during the 21st century. However, there is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter of sea level rise during the 21st century. {13.4, 13.5}   - The basis for higher projections of global mean sea level rise in the 21st century has been considered and it has been concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to evaluate the probability of specific levels above the assessed likely range. Many semi-empirical model projections of global mean sea level rise are higher than process-based model projections (up to about twice as large), but there is no consensus in the scientific community about their reliability and there is thus low confidence in their projections. {13.5} - Sea level rise will not be uniform. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience sea level change within 20% of the global mean sea level change. {13.1, 13.6}   Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence). Further uptake of carbon by the ocean will increase ocean acidification. {6.4}  - Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue under all four RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concentration pathways (very high confidence). The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority of models projects a continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models simulate a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and land use change. {6.4} - Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback between climate and the carbon cycle is positive in the 21st century; that is, climate change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by rising atmospheric CO2. As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will remain in the atmosphere. A positive feedback between climate and the carbon cycle on century to millennial time scales is supported by paleoclimate observations and modelling. {6.2, 6.4}   - Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios. The corresponding decrease in surface ocean pH by the end of 21st century is in the range18 of 0.06 to 0.07 for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 for RCP8.5 (see Figures .7 and .8). {6.4} - Cumulative CO2 emissions20 for the 2012 to 2100 period compatible with the RCP atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as derived from 15 Earth System Models, range18 from 140 to 410 GtC for RCP2.6, 595 to 1005 GtC for RCP4.5, 840 to 1250 GtC for RCP6.0, and 1415 to 1910 GtC for RCP8.5 (see Table .3). {6.4} - By 2050, annual CO2 emissions derived from Earth System Models following RCP2.6 are smaller than 1990 emissions (by 14 to 96%). By the end of the 21st century, about half of the models infer emissions slightly above zero, while the other half infer a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. {6.4, Figure TS.19} - The release of CO2 or CH4 to the atmosphere from thawing permafrost carbon stocks over the 21st century is assessed to be in the range of 50 to 250 GtC for RCP8.5 (low confidence). {6.4}  E.8 Climate Stabilization, Climate Change Commitment and Irreversibility  Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond (see Figure .10). Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2. {12.5}  - Cumulative total emissions of CO2 and global mean surface temperature response are approximately linearly related (see Figure .10). Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions21, and therefore, e.g., higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later. {12.5} - Limiting the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone with a probability of >33%, >50%, and >66% to less than 2-C since the period 1861-188022, will require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to stay between 0 and about 1570 GtC (5760 GtCO2), 0 and about 1210 GtC (4440 GtCO2), and 0 and about 1000 GtC (3670 GtCO2) since that period, respectively23. These upper amounts are reduced to about 900 GtC (3300 GtCO2), 820 GtC (3010 GtCO2), and 790 GtC (2900 GtCO2), respectively, when accounting for non-CO2 forcings as in RCP2.6. An amount of 515 [445 to 585] GtC (1890 [1630 to 2150] GtCO2), was already emitted by 2011. {12.5}  - A lower warming target, or a higher likelihood of remaining below a specific warming target, will require lower cumulative CO2 emissions. Accounting for warming effects of increases in non-CO2 greenhouse gases, reductions in aerosols, or the release of greenhouse gases from permafrost will also lower the cumulative CO2 emissions for a specific warming target (see Figure .10). {12.5}    - A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to  millennial time scale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation  of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Due to the long time scales of heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth, ocean warming will continue for centuries. Depending on the scenario, about 15 to 40% of emitted CO2 will remain in the atmosphere longer than 1,000 years. {Box 6.1, 12.4, 12.5}  - It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue beyond 2100, with sea level rise due to thermal expansion to continue for many centuries. The few available model results that go beyond 2100 indicate global mean sea level rise above the pre-industrial level by 2300 to be less than 1 m for a radiative forcing that corresponds to CO2 concentrations that peak and decline and remain below 500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing that corresponds to a CO2 concentration that is above 700 ppm but below 1500 ppm, as in the scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m (medium confidence). {13.5}  Figure .10 | Global mean surface temperature increase as a function of cumulative total global CO2 emissions from various lines of evidence. Multimodel results from a hierarchy of climate-carbon cycle models for each RCP until 2100 are shown with coloured lines and decadal means (dots). Some decadal means are labeled for clarity (e.g., 2050 indicating the decade 2040-2049). Model results over the historical period (1860 to 2010) are indicated in black. The coloured plume illustrates the multi-model spread over the four RCP scenarios and fades with the decreasing number of available models in RCP8.5. The multi-model mean and range simulated by CMIP5 models, forced by a CO2 increase of 1% per year (1% yr-1 CO2 simulations), is given by the thin black line and grey area. For a specific amount of cumulative CO2 emissions, the 1% per year CO2 simulations exhibit lower warming than those driven by RCPs, which include additional non-CO2 forcings. Temperature values are given relative to the 1861-1880 base period, emissions relative to 1870. Decadal averages are connected by straight lines. For further technical details see the Technical Summary Supplementary Material. {Figure 12.45; TS TFE.8, Figure 1}     - Sustained mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and some part of the mass loss might be irreversible.  There is high confidence that sustained warming greater than some threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of  the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a global mean sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current estimates  indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1-C (low confidence) but less than about 4-C (medium confidence)  global mean warming with respect to pre-industrial. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-  based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current evidence and understanding    is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment. {5.8, 13.4, 13.5}  - Methods that aim to deliberately alter the climate system to counter climate change, termed geoengineering, have been proposed. Limited evidence precludes a comprehensive quantitative assessment of both Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and their impact on the climate system. CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on a global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. Modelling indicates that SRM methods, if realizable, have the potential to substantially offset a global temperature rise, but they would also modify the global water cycle, and would not reduce ocean acidification. If SRM were terminated for any reason, there is high confidence that global surface temperatures would rise very rapidly to values consistent with the greenhouse gas forcing. CDR and SRM methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale. {6.5, 7.7}  Box .1: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) Climate change projections in IPCC Working Group I require information about future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and other climate drivers. This information is often expressed as a scenario of human activities, which are not assessed in this report. Scenarios used in Working Group I have focused on anthropogenic emissions and do not include changes in natural drivers such as solar or volcanic forcing or natural emissions, for example, of CH4 and N2O. For the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC, the scientific community has defined a set of four new scenarios, denoted Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs, see Glossary). They are identified by their approximate total radiative forcing in year 2100 relative to 1750: 2.6 W m-2 for RCP2.6, 4.5 W m-2 for RCP4.5, 6.0 W m-2 for RCP6.0, and 8.5 W m-2 for RCP8.5. For the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) results, these values should be understood as indicative only, as the climate forcing resulting from all drivers varies between models due to specific model characteristics and treatment of short-lived climate forcers. These four RCPs include one mitigation scenario leading to a very low forcing level (RCP2.6), two stabilization scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6), and one scenario with very high greenhouse gas emissions (RCP8.5). The RCPs can thus represent a range of 21st century climate policies, as compared with the no-climate policy of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) used in the Third Assessment Report and the Fourth Assessment Report. For RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, radiative forcing does not peak by year 2100; for RCP2.6 it peaks and declines; and for RCP4.5 it stabilizes by 2100. Each RCP provides spatially resolved data sets of land use change and sector-based emissions of air pollutants, and it specifies annual greenhouse gas concentrations and anthropogenic emissions up to 2100. RCPs are based on a combination of integrated assessment models, simple climate models, atmospheric chemistry and global carbon cycle models. While the RCPs span a wide range of total forcing values, they do not cover the full range of emissions in the literature, particularly for aerosols. Most of the CMIP5 and Earth System Model simulations were performed with prescribed CO2 concentrations reaching 421 ppm (RCP2.6), 538 ppm (RCP4.5), 670 ppm (RCP6.0), and 936 ppm (RCP 8.5) by the year 2100. Including also the prescribed concentrations of CH4 and N2O, the combined CO2-equivalent concentrations are 475 ppm (RCP2.6), 630 ppm (RCP4.5), 800 ppm (RCP6.0), and 1313 ppm (RCP8.5). For RCP8.5, additional CMIP5 Earth System Model simulations are performed with prescribed CO2 emissions as provided by the integrated assessment models. For all RCPs, additional calculations were made with updated atmospheric chemistry data and models (including the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate component of CMIP5) using the RCP prescribed emissions of the chemically reactive gases (CH4, N2O, HFCs, NOx, CO, NMVOC). These simulations enable investigation of uncertainties related to carbon cycle feedbacks and atmospheric chemistry.      "
IPCC-2013-6.txt,"INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON climate change WG II WORKING GROUP II CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE   ASSESSING AND MANAGING THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE  Human interference with the climate system is occurring,1 and climate change poses risks for human and natural systems (Figure .1). The  assessment of impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability in the Working Group II contribution to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (WGII AR5)  evaluates how patterns of risks and potential benefits are shifting due to climate change. It considers how impacts and risks related to climate  change can be reduced and managed through adaptation and mitigation. The report assesses needs, options, opportunities, constraints,    resilience, limits, and other aspects associated with adaptation.  Climate change involves complex interactions and changing likelihoods of diverse impacts. A focus on risk, which is new in this report, supports decision making in the context of climate change and complements other elements of the report. People and societies may perceive or rank risks and potential benefits differently, given diverse values and goals.  Compared to past WGII reports, the WGII AR5 assesses a substantially larger knowledge base of relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic literature. Increased literature has facilitated comprehensive assessment across a broader set of topics and sectors, with expanded coverage of human systems, adaptation, and the ocean. See Background Box .1. Section A of this summary characterizes observed impacts, vulnerability and exposure, and adaptive responses to date. Section B examines future risks and potential benefits. Section C considers principles for effective adaptation and the broader interactions among adaptation, mitigation,  and sustainable development. Background Box .2 defines central concepts, and Background Box .3 introduces terms used to convey the degree of certainty in key findings. Chapter references in brackets and in footnotes indicate support for findings, figures, and tables. A: OBSERVED IMPACTS, VULNERABILITY, AND ADAPTATION IN A COMPLEX AND CHANGING WORLD A-1. Observed Impacts, Vulnerability, and Exposure In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Evidence of climate-change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed5 to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences. See Figure .2. Attribution of observed impacts in the WGII AR5 generally links responses of natural and human systems to observed climate change, regardless of its cause.In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality (medium confidence). Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate change (high confidence), affecting runoff and water resources downstream (medium confidence). Climate change is causing permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation regions (high confidence).Many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances, and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change (high confidence). See Figure .2B. While only a few recent species extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change (high confidence), natural global climate change at rates slower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years (high confidence).Based on many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops, negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts (high confidence). The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions (high confidence). Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate (medium confidence). Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data, which are fewer for soy compared to the other crops. Observed impacts relate mainly to production aspects of food security rather than access 9 The WGII AR5 glossary defines many terms used across chapters of the report. Reflecting progress in science, some definitions differ in breadth and focus from the definitions used in the AR4 and other IPCC reports.    Background Box .3 | Communication of the Degree of Certainty in Assessment Findings The degree of certainty in each key finding of the assessment is based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of evidence (e.g.,  data, mechanistic understanding, theory, models, expert judgment) and the degree of agreement. The summary terms to describe    evidence are: limited, medium, or robust; and agreement: low, medium, or high.  Confidence in the validity of a finding synthesizes the evaluation of evidence and agreement. Levels of confidence include five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high.  The likelihood, or probability, of some well-defined outcome having occurred or occurring in the future can be described quantitatively through the following terms: virtually certain, 99-100% probability; extremely likely, 95-100%; very likely, 90-100%; likely, 66-100%; more likely than not, >50-100%; about as likely as not, 33-66%; unlikely, 0-33%; very unlikely, 0-10%; extremely unlikely, 0-5%; and exceptionally unlikely, 0-1%. Unless otherwise indicated, findings assigned a likelihood term are associated with high or very high confidence. Where appropriate, findings are also formulated as statements of fact without using uncertainty qualifiers.  Within paragraphs of this summary, the confidence, evidence, and agreement terms given for a bold key finding apply to subsequent statements in the paragraph, unless additional terms are provided.  or other components of food security. See Figure .2C. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes among other factors (medium confidence).At present the worldwide burden of human ill-health from climate change is relatively small compared with effects of other stressors and is not well quantified. However, there has been increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming (medium confidence). Local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some waterborne illnesses and disease vectors (medium confidence).Differences in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic factors and from multidimensional inequalities often produced by uneven development processes (very high confidence). These differences shape differential risks from climate change. See Figure .1. People who are socially, economically, culturally, politically, institutionally, or otherwise marginalized are especially vulnerable to climate change and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses (medium evidence, high agreement). This heightened vulnerability is rarely due to a single cause. Rather, it is the product of intersecting social processes that result in inequalities in socioeconomic status and income, as well as in exposure. Such social processes include, for example, discrimination on the basis of gender, class, ethnicity, age, and (dis)ability.Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high confidence). Impacts of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, morbidity and mortality, and consequences for mental health and human well-being. For countries at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with a significant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some sectors.Climate-related hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods, especially for people living in poverty (high confidence). Climate-related hazards affect poor people's lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields, or destruction of homes and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity. Observed positive effects for poor and marginalized people, which are limited and often indirect, include examples such as diversification of social networks and of agricultural practices. Violent conflict increases vulnerability to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement). Large-scale violent conflict harms assets that facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, institutions, natural resources, social capital, and livelihood opportunities.A-2. Adaptation Experience Throughout history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped with climate, climate variability, and extremes, with varying degrees of success. This section focuses on adaptive human responses to observed and projected climate-change impacts, which can also address broader risk-reduction and development objectives. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of responses (high confidence). Engineered and technological options are commonly implemented adaptive responses, often integrated within existing programs such as disaster risk management and water management. There is increasing recognition of the value of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation options adopted to date continue to emphasize incremental adjustments and cobenefits and are starting to emphasize flexibility and learning (medium evidence, medium agreement). Most assessments of adaptation have been restricted to impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the processes of implementation or the effects of adaptation actions (medium evidence, high agreement).Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sector and within communities (high confidence). Governments at various levels are starting to develop adaptation plans and policies and to integrate climate-change considerations into broader development plans. Examples of adaptation across regions include the following: - In Africa, most national governments are initiating governance systems for adaptation. Disaster risk management, adjustments in technologies and infrastructure, ecosystem-based approaches, basic public health measures, and livelihood diversification are reducing vulnerability, although efforts to date tend to be isolated.18 - In Europe, adaptation policy has been developed across all levels of government, with some adaptation planning integrated into coastal and water management, into environmental protection and land planning, and into disaster risk management.19 - In Asia, adaptation is being facilitated in some areas through mainstreaming climate adaptation action into subnational development planning, early warning systems, integrated water resources management, agroforestry, and coastal reforestation of mangroves.20 - In Australasia, planning for sea level rise, and in southern Australia for reduced water availability, is becoming adopted widely. Planning for sea level rise has evolved considerably over the past 2 decades and shows a diversity of approaches, although its implementation remains piecemeal.21 - In North America, governments are engaging in incremental adaptation assessment and planning, particularly at the municipal level. Some proactive adaptation is occurring to protect longer-term investments in energy and public infrastructure.22 - In Central and South America, ecosystem-based adaptation including protected areas, conservation agreements, and community management of natural areas is occurring. Resilient crop varieties, climate forecasts, and integrated water resources management are being adopted within the agricultural sector in some areas. - In the Arctic, some communities have begun to deploy adaptive co-management strategies and communications infrastructure, combining traditional and scientific knowledge.- In small islands, which have diverse physical and human attributes, community-based adaptation has been shown to generate larger benefits when delivered in conjunction with other development activities.- In the ocean, international cooperation and marine spatial planning are starting to facilitate adaptation to climate change, with constraints  from challenges of spatial scale and governance issues. A-3. The Decision-making Context Climate variability and extremes have long been important in many decision-making contexts. Climate-related risks are now evolving over time due to both climate change and development. This section builds from existing experience with decision making and risk management. It creates a foundation for understanding the report's assessment of future climate-related risks and potential responses. Responding to climate-related risks involves decision making in a changing world, with continuing uncertainty about the severity and timing of climate-change impacts and with limits to the effectiveness of adaptation (high confidence). Iterative risk management is a useful framework for decision making in complex situations characterized by large potential consequences, persistent uncertainties, long timeframes, potential for learning, and multiple climatic and non-climatic influences changing over time. See Figure .3. Assessment of the widest possible range of potential impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences, is central to understanding the benefits and trade-offs of alternative risk management actions. The complexity of adaptation actions across scales and contexts means that monitoring and learning are important components of effective adaptation.Adaptation and mitigation choices in the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century (high confidence). Figure .4 illustrates projected warming under a low-emission mitigation scenario and a high-emission scenario [Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5], along with observed temperature changes. The benefits of adaptation and mitigation occur over different but overlapping timeframes. Projected global temperature increase over the next few decades is similar across emission scenarios (Figure .4B).28 During this near-term period, risks will evolve as socioeconomic trends interact with the changing climate. Societal   responses, particularly adaptations, will influence near-term outcomes. In the second half of the 21st century and beyond, global temperature increase diverges across emission scenarios (Figure .4B and 4C).29 For this longer-term period, near-term and longer-term adaptation and mitigation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate change. Assessment of risks in the WGII AR5 relies on diverse forms of evidence. Expert judgment is used to integrate evidence into evaluations of risks. Forms of evidence include, for example, empirical observations, experimental results, process-based understanding, statistical approaches, and simulation and descriptive models. Future risks related to climate change vary substantially across plausible alternative development pathways, and the relative importance of development and climate change varies by sector, region, and time period (high confidence). Scenarios are useful tools for characterizing possible future socioeconomic pathways, climate change and its risks, and policy implications. Climate-model projections informing evaluations of risks in this report are generally based on the RCPs (Figure .4), as well as the older IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios. Uncertainties about future vulnerability, exposure, and responses of interlinked human and natural systems are large (high confidence). This motivates exploration of a wide range of socioeconomic futures in assessments of risks. Understanding future vulnerability, exposure, and response capacity of interlinked human and natural systems is challenging due to the number of interacting social, economic, and cultural factors, which have been incompletely considered to date. These factors include wealth and its distribution across society, demographics, migration, access to technology and information, employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses, societal values, governance structures, and institutions to resolve conflicts. International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate change at regional scales. B: FUTURE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADAPTATION This section presents future risks and more limited potential benefits across sectors and regions, over the next few decades and in the second half of the 21st century and beyond. It examines how they are affected by the magnitude and rate of climate change and by socioeconomic choices. It also assesses opportunities for reducing impacts and managing risks through adaptation and mitigation.  B-1. Key Risks across Sectors and Regions Key risks are potentially severe impacts relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which refers to ""dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system."" Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability of societies and systems exposed, or both. Identification of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following specific criteria: large magnitude, high probability, or irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks through adaptation or mitigation. Key risks are integrated into five complementary and overarching reasons for concern (RFCs) in Assessment Box .1.   Five integrative reasons for concern (RFCs) provide a framework for summarizing key risks across sectors and regions. First identified in the IPCC Third Assessment Report, the RFCs illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation limits for people, economies, and ecosystems. They provide one starting point for evaluating dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Risks for each RFC, updated based on assessment of the literature and expert judgments, are presented below and in Assessment Box .1 Figure 1. All temperatures below are given as global average temperature change relative to 1986-2005 (""recent""). 1) Unique and threatened systems: Some unique and threatened systems, including ecosystems and cultures, are already at risk from climate change (high confidence). The number of such systems at risk of severe consequences is higher with additional warming of around 1-C. Many species and systems with limited adaptive capacity are subject to very high risks with additional warming of 2-C, particularly Arctic-sea-ice and coral-reef systems.  2) Extreme weather events: Climate-change-related risks from extreme events, such as heat waves, extreme precipitation, and coastal flooding, are already moderate (high confidence) and high with 1-C additional warming (medium confidence). Risks associated with some types of extreme events (e.g., extreme heat) increase further at higher temperatures (high confidence).  3) Distribution of impacts: Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. Risks are already moderate because of regionally differentiated climate-change impacts on crop production in particular (medium to high confidence). Based on projected decreases in regional crop yields and water availability, risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high for additional warming above 2-C (medium confidence).  4) Global aggregate impacts: Risks of global aggregate impacts are moderate for additional warming between 1-2-C, reflecting impacts to both Earth's biodiversity and the overall global economy (medium confidence). Extensive biodiversity loss with associated loss of ecosystem goods and services results in high risks around 3-C additional warming (high confidence). Aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but few quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming around 3-C or above.  5) Large-scale singular events: With increasing warming, some physical systems or ecosystems may be at risk of abrupt and irreversible changes. Risks associated with such tipping points become moderate between 0-1-C additional warming, due to early warning signs that both warm-water coral reef and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts (medium confidence). Risks increase disproportionately as temperature increases between 1-2-C additional warming and become high above 3-C, due to the potential for a large and irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss. For sustained warming greater than some threshold,35 near-complete loss of the Greenland ice sheet would occur over a millennium or more, contributing up to 7 m of global mean sea level rise.    Assessment Box .1 Figure 1 | A global perspective on climate-related risks. Risks associated with reasons for concern are shown at right for increasing levels of climate change. The color shading indicates the additional risk due to climate change when a temperature level is reached and then sustained or exceeded. Undetectable risk (white) indicates no associated impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change. Moderate risk (yellow) indicates that associated impacts are both detectable and attributable to climate change with at least medium confidence, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key risks. High risk (red) indicates severe and widespread impacts, also accounting for the other specific criteria for key risks. Purple, introduced in this assessment, shows that very high risk is indicated by all specific criteria for key risks. [Figure 19-4] For reference, past and projected global annual average surface temperature is shown at left, as in Figure .4. [Figure RC-1, Box CC-RC; WGI AR5 Figures .1 and .7] Based on the longest global surface temperature dataset available, the observed change between the average of the period 1850-1900 and of the AR5 reference period (1986-2005) is 0.61-C (5-95% confidence interval: 0.55 to 0.67-C) [WGI AR5 , 2.4], which is used here as an approximation of the change in global mean surface temperature since preindustrial times, referred to as the period before 1750. [WGI and WGII AR5 glossaries]  i) Risk of death, injury, ill-health, or disrupted livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island developing states and other small islands, due to storm surges, coastal flooding, and sea level rise.37 [RFC 1-5] ii) Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted livelihoods for large urban populations due to inland flooding in some regions.38 [RFC 2 and 3] iii) Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and emergency services.39 [RFC 2-4] iv) Risk of mortality and morbidity during periods of extreme heat, particularly for vulnerable urban populations and those working outdoors in urban or rural areas.40 [RFC 2 and 3] v) Risk of food insecurity and the breakdown of food systems linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer populations in urban and rural settings.41 [RFC 2-4] vi) Risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income due to insufficient access to drinking and irrigation water and reduced agricultural productivity, particularly for farmers and pastoralists with minimal capital in semi-arid regions.42 [RFC 2 and 3] vii) Risk of loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for coastal livelihoods, especially for fishing communities in the tropics and the Arctic.43 [RFC 1, 2, and 4] viii) Risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services they provide for livelihoods.44 [RFC 1, 3, and 4] Many key risks constitute particular challenges for the least developed countries and vulnerable communities, given their limited ability to cope.  Increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts. Some risks of climate change are considerable at 1 or 2-C above preindustrial levels (as shown in Assessment Box .1). Global climate change risks are high to very high with global mean temperature increase of 4-C or more above preindustrial levels in all reasons for concern (Assessment Box .1), and include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial species extinction, large risks to global and regional  food security, and the combination of high temperature and humidity compromising normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas for parts of the year (high confidence). The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature (medium confidence).The overall risks of climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change. Risks are reduced substantially under the assessed scenario with the lowest temperature projections (RCP2.6 - low emissions) compared to the highest temperature projections (RCP8.5 - high emissions), particularly in the second half of the 21st century (very high confidence). Reducing climate change can also reduce the scale of adaptation that might be required. Under all assessed scenarios for adaptation and mitigation, some risk from adverse impacts remains (very high confidence).B-2. Sectoral Risks and Potential for Adaptation Climate change is projected to amplify existing climate-related risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Some of these risks will be limited to a particular sector or region, and others will have cascading effects. To a lesser extent, climate change is also projected to have some potential benefits. Freshwater resources Freshwater-related risks of climate change increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations (robust evidence, high agreement). The fraction of global population experiencing water scarcity and the fraction affected by major river floods increase with the level of warming in the 21st century.Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement), intensifying competition for water among sectors (limited evidence, medium agreement). In presently dry regions, drought frequency will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes (robust evidence, high agreement). Climate change is projected to reduce raw water quality and pose risks to drinking water quality even with conventional treatment, due to interacting factors: increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient, and pollutant loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentration of pollutants during droughts; and disruption of treatment facilities during floods (medium evidence, high agreement). Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based approaches, and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help create resilience to uncertain hydrological changes and impacts due to climate change (limited evidence, high agreement).Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projected climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, over- exploitation, pollution, and invasive species (high confidence). Extinction risk is increased under all RCP scenarios, with risk increasing with both magnitude and rate of climate change. Many species will be unable to track suitable climates under mid- and high-range rates of climate change (i.e., RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) during the 21st century (medium confidence). Lower rates of change (i.e., RCP2.6) will pose fewer problems. See Figure .5. Some species will adapt to new climates. Those that cannot adapt sufficiently fast will decrease in abundance or go extinct in part or all of their ranges. Management actions, such as maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted species migration and dispersal,  manipulation of disturbance regimes (e.g., fires, floods), and reduction of other stressors, can reduce, but not eliminate, risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due to climate change, as well as increase the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate (high confidence).Within this century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands (medium confidence). Examples that could lead to substantial impact on climate are the boreal-tundra Arctic system (medium confidence) and the Amazon forest (low confidence). Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere (e.g., in peatlands, permafrost, and forests) is susceptible to loss to the atmosphere as a result of climate change, deforestation, and ecosystem degradation (high confidence). Increased tree mortality and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over the 21st century, due to increased temperatures and drought (medium confidence). Forest dieback poses risks for carbon storage, biodiversity, wood production, water quality, amenity, and economic activity.  Figure .5 | Maximum speeds at which species can move across landscapes (based on observations and models; vertical axis on left), compared with speeds at which temperatures are projected to move across landscapes (climate velocities for temperature; vertical axis on right). Human interventions, such as transport or habitat fragmentation, can greatly increase or decrease speeds of movement. White boxes with black bars indicate ranges and medians of maximum movement speeds for trees, plants, mammals, plant-feeding insects (median not estimated), and freshwater mollusks. For RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 for 2050-2090, horizontal lines show climate velocity for the global-land-area average and for large flat regions. Species with maximum speeds below each line are expected to be unable to track warming in the absence of human intervention. [Figure 4-5]  Figure .6 | Climate change risks for fisheries. (A) Projected global redistribution of maximum catch potential of ~1000 exploited fish and invertebrate species. Projections  compare the 10-year averages 2001-2010 and 2051-2060 using SRES A1B, without analysis of potential impacts of overfishing or ocean acidification. (B) Marine mollusk and  crustacean fisheries (present-day estimated annual catch rates 0.005 tonnes km-2) and known locations of cold- and warm-water corals, depicted on a global map showing the  projected distribution of ocean acidification under RCP8.5 (pH change from 1986-2005 to 2081-2100). [WGI AR5 Figure .8] The bottom panel compares sensitivity to  ocean acidification across mollusks, crustaceans, and corals, vulnerable animal phyla with socioeconomic relevance (e.g., for coastal protection and fisheries). The number of  species analyzed across studies is given for each category of elevated CO2. For 2100, RCP scenarios falling within each CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) category are as follows:  RCP4.5 for 500-650 atm (approximately equivalent to ppm in the atmosphere), RCP6.0 for 651-850 atm, and RCP8.5 for 851-1370 atm. By 2150, RCP8.5 falls within the    1371-2900 atm category. The control category corresponds to 380 atm. [6.1, 6.3, 30.5, Figures 6-10 and 6-14; WGI AR5 Box .1]  Coastal systems and low-lying areas Due to sea level rise projected throughout the 21st century and beyond, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion (very high confidence). The population and assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well as human pressures on coastal ecosystems will increase significantly in the coming decades due to population growth, economic development, and urbanization (high confidence). The relative costs of coastal adaptation vary strongly among and within regions and countries for the 21st century. Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts that, in some cases, could have associated damage and adaptation costs of several percentage points of GDP. Marine systems Due to projected climate change by the mid 21st century and beyond, global marine-species redistribution and marine-biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services (high confidence). Spatial shifts of marine species due to projected warming will cause high-latitude invasions and high local-extinction rates in the tropics and semi-enclosed seas (medium confidence). Species richness and fisheries catch potential are projected to increase, on average, at mid and high latitudes (high confidence) and decrease at tropical latitudes (medium confidence). See Figure .6A. The progressive expansion of oxygen minimum zones and anoxic ""dead zones"" is projected to further constrain fish habitat. Open-ocean net primary production is projected to redistribute and, by 2100, fall globally under all RCP scenarios. Climate change adds to the threats of over-fishing and other nonclimatic stressors, thus complicating marine management regimes (high confidence).For medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0, and 8.5), ocean acidification poses substantial risks to marine ecosystems, especially polar ecosystems and coral reefs, associated with impacts on the physiology, behavior, and population dynamics of individual species from phytoplankton to animals (medium to high confidence). Highly calcified mollusks, echinoderms, and reef-building corals are more sensitive than crustaceans (high confidence) and fishes (low confidence), with potentially detrimental consequences for fisheries and livelihoods. See Figure .6B. Ocean acidification acts together with other global changes (e.g., warming, decreasing oxygen levels) and with local changes (e.g., pollution, eutrophication) (high confidence). Simultaneous drivers, such as warming and ocean acidification, can lead to interactive, complex, and amplified impacts for species and ecosystems. Food security and food production systems For the major crops (wheat, rice, and maize) in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2-C or more above late-20th-century levels, although individual locations may benefit (medium confidence). Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios, with about 10% of projections for the period 2030-2049 showing yield gains of more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than   25%, compared to the late 20th century. After 2050 the risk of more severe yield impacts increases and depends on the level of warming. See Figure .7. Climate change is projected to progressively increase inter-annual variability of crop yields in many regions. These projected impacts will occur in the context of rapidly rising crop demand.All aspects of food security are potentially affected by climate change, including food access, utilization, and price stability (high confidence). Redistribution of marine fisheries catch potential towards higher latitudes poses risk of reduced supplies, income, and employment in tropical countries, with potential implications for food security (medium confidence). Global temperature increases of ~4-C or more above late-20th-century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security globally and regionally (high confidence). Risks to food security are generally greater in low-latitude areas.Urban areas Many global risks of climate change are concentrated in urban areas (medium confidence). Steps that build resilience and enable sustainable development can accelerate successful climate-change adaptation globally. Heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, and water scarcity pose risks in urban areas for people, assets, economies, and ecosystems (very high confidence). Risks are amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in poor-quality housing and exposed areas. Reducing basic service deficits, improving housing, and building resilient infrastructure systems could significantly reduce vulnerability and exposure in urban areas. Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level urban risk governance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector, and appropriate financing and institutional development (medium confidence). Increased capacity, voice, and influence of low-income groups and vulnerable communities and their partnerships with local governments also benefit adaptation.54 7.4-5, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5, Table 7-2, Figures 7-4, 7-5, 7-6, 7-7, and 7-8 55 6.3-5, 7.4-5, 9.3, 22.3, 24.4, 25.7, 26.5, Table 7-3, Figures 7-1, 7-4, and 7-7, Box 7-1 56 3.5, 8.2-4, 22.3, 24.4-5, 26.8, Table 8-2, Boxes 25-9 and CC-HS   Rural areas Major future rural impacts are expected in the near term and beyond through impacts on water availability and supply, food security, and agricultural incomes, including shifts in production areas of food and non-food crops across the world (high confidence). These impacts are expected to disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in rural areas, such as female-headed households  and those with limited access to land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure, and education. Further adaptations for agriculture, water, forestry, and biodiversity can occur through policies taking account of rural decision-making contexts. Trade reform and investment can improve market access for small-scale farms (medium confidence).Key economic sectors and services For most economic sectors, the impacts of drivers such as changes in population, age structure, income, technology, relative prices, lifestyle, regulation, and governance are projected to be large relative to the impacts of climate change (medium evidence, high agreement). Climate change is projected to reduce energy demand for heating and increase energy demand for cooling in the residential and commercial sectors (robust evidence, high agreement). Climate change is projected to affect energy sources and technologies differently, depending on resources (e.g., water flow, wind, insolation), technological processes (e.g., cooling), or locations (e.g., coastal regions, floodplains) involved. More severe and/or frequent extreme weather events and/or hazard types are projected to increase losses and loss variability in various regions and challenge insurance systems to offer affordable coverage while raising more risk-based capital, particularly in developing countries. Large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic diversification are examples of adaptation actions.Global economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate. Economic impact estimates completed over the past 20 years vary in their coverage of subsets of economic sectors and depend on a large number of assumptions, many of which are disputable, and many estimates do not account for catastrophic changes, tipping points, and many other factors.59 With these recognized limitations, the incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of ~2-C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income (-1 standard deviation around the mean) (medium evidence, medium agreement). Losses are more likely than not to be greater, rather than smaller, than this range (limited evidence, high agreement). Additionally, there are large differences between and within countries. Losses accelerate with greater warming (limited evidence, high agreement), but few quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming around 3-C or above. Estimates of the incremental economic impact of emitting carbon dioxide lie between a few dollars and several hundreds of dollars per tonne of carbon60 (robust evidence, medium agreement). Estimates vary strongly with the assumed damage function and discount rate.Human health Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist (very high confidence). Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high confidence). Examples include greater likelihood of injury, disease, and death due to more intense heat waves and fires (very high confidence); increased likelihood of under-nutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions (high confidence); risks from lost work capacity and reduced labor productivity in vulnerable populations; and increased risks from food- and water-borne diseases (very high confidence) and vector-borne diseases (medium confidence). Positive effects are expected to include modest reductions in cold-related mortality and morbidity in some areas due to fewer cold extremes (low confidence), geographical shifts in food production (medium confidence), and reduced capacity of vectors to transmit some diseases. But globally over the 21st century, the magnitude and severity of negative impacts are projected to increasingly outweigh positive impacts (high confidence). The most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are  programs that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response, and alleviate poverty (very high confidence). By 2100 for the high-emission scenario RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is projected to compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors (high confidence).Human security Climate change over the 21st century is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Displacement risk increases when populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, in both rural and urban areas, particularly in developing countries with low income. Expanding opportunities for mobility can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can be responses to both extreme weather events and longer-term climate variability and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy. There is low confidence in quantitative projections of changes in mobility, due to its complex, multi-causal nature.Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts in the form of civil war and inter-group violence by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). Multiple lines of evidence relate climate variability to these forms of conflict.The impacts of climate change on the critical infrastructure and territorial integrity of many states are expected to influence national security policies (medium evidence, medium agreement). For example, land inundation due to sea level rise poses risks to the territorial integrity of small island states and states with extensive coastlines. Some transboundary impacts of climate change, such as changes in sea ice, shared water resources, and pelagic fish stocks, have the potential to increase rivalry among states, but robust national and intergovernmental institutions can enhance cooperation and manage many of these rivalries.Livelihoods and poverty Throughout the 21st century, climate-change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security, and prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confidence). Climate-change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing inequality, in both developed and developing countries. In urban and rural areas, wage-labor-dependent poor households that are net buyers of food are expected to be particularly affected due to food price increases, including in regions with high food insecurity and high inequality (particularly in Africa), although the agricultural self-employed could benefit. Insurance programs, social protection measures, and disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among poor and marginalized people, if policies address poverty and multidimensional inequalities.B-3. Regional Key Risks and Potential for Adaptation Risks will vary through time across regions and populations, dependent on myriad factors including the extent of adaptation and mitigation. A selection of key regional risks identified with medium to high confidence is presented in Assessment Box .2. For extended summary of regional risks and potential benefits, see Technical Summary Section B-3 and WGII AR5 Part B: Regional Aspects.    Assessment Box .2 | Regional Key Risks  The accompanying Assessment Box .2 Table 1 highlights several representative key risks for each region. Key risks have been  identified based on assessment of the relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic literature detailed in supporting chapter sections.  Identification of key risks was based on expert judgment using the following specific criteria: large magnitude, high probability, or  irreversibility of impacts; timing of impacts; persistent vulnerability or exposure contributing to risks; or limited potential to reduce risks    through adaptation or mitigation.  For each key risk, risk levels were assessed for three timeframes. For the present, risk levels were estimated for current adaptation and a hypothetical highly adapted state, identifying where current adaptation deficits exist. For two future timeframes, risk levels were estimated for a continuation of current adaptation and for a highly adapted state, representing the potential for and limits to adaptation. The risk levels integrate probability and consequence over the widest possible range of potential outcomes, based on available literature. These potential outcomes result from the interaction of climate-related hazards, vulnerability, and exposure. Each risk level reflects total risk from climatic and non-climatic factors. Key risks and risk levels vary across regions and over time, given differing socioeconomic development pathways, vulnerability and exposure to hazards, adaptive capacity, and risk perceptions. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions, because the assessment considers potential impacts and adaptation in different physical, biological, and human systems across diverse contexts. This assessment of risks acknowledges the importance of differences in values and objectives in interpretation of the assessed risk levels.  Assessment Box .2 Table 1 | Key regional risks from climate change and the potential for reducing risks through adaptation and mitigation. Each key risk is characterized as very low to very high for three timeframes: the present, near term (here, assessed over 2030-2040), and longer term (here, assessed over 2080-2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially for different emission scenarios. For the longer term, risk levels are presented for two scenarios of global mean temperature increase (2-C and 4-C above preindustrial levels). These scenarios illustrate the potential for mitigation and adaptation to reduce the risks related to climate change. Climate-related drivers of impacts are indicated by icons.

Significant reduction in water availability from river abstraction and from groundwater resources, combined with increased water demand (e.g., for irrigation, energy and industry, domestic use) and with reduced water drainage and runoff as a result of increased evaporative demand, particularly in southern Europe (high confidence) [23.4, 23.7] Increased economic losses and people affected by extreme heat events: impacts on health and well-being, labor productivity, crop production, air quality, and increasing risk of wildfires in southern Europe and in Russian boreal region (medium confidence) [23.3-7, Table 23-1]  - Proven adaptation potential from adoption of more water-efficient technologies and of water-saving strategies (e.g., for irrigation, crop species, land cover, industries, domestic use) - Implementation of best practices and governance instruments in river basin management plans and integrated water management - Implementation of warning systems - Adaptation of dwellings and workplaces and of transport and energy infrastructure - Reductions in emissions to improve air quality - Improved wildfire management - Development of insurance products against weather-related yield variations  Key risk Increased riverine, coastal, and urban flooding leading to widespread damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and settlements in Asia (medium confidence) [24.4] Increased risk of heat-related mortality (high confidence) [24.4]  Asia Adaptation issues & prospects - Exposure reduction via structural and non-structural measures, effective land-use planning, and selective relocation - Reduction in the vulnerability of lifeline infrastructure and services (e.g., water, energy, waste management, food, biomass, mobility, local ecosystems, telecommunications) - Construction of monitoring and early warning systems; Measures to identify exposed areas, assist vulnerable areas and households, and diversify livelihoods - Economic diversification - Heat health warning systems - Urban planning to reduce heat islands; Improvement of the built environment; Development of sustainable cities - New work practices to avoid heat stress among outdoor workers  Increased risk of drought-related water and food shortage causing malnutrition (high confidence) [24.4]  - Disaster preparedness including early-warning systems and local coping strategies - Adaptive/integrated water resource management - Water infrastructure and reservoir development - Diversification of water sources including water re-use - More efficient use of water (e.g., improved agricultural practices, irrigation management, and resilient agriculture) Australasia  Key risk Significant change in community composition and structure of coral reef systems in Australia (high confidence) [25.6, 30.5, Boxes CC-CR and CC-OA]  Adaptation issues & prospects - Ability of corals to adapt naturally appears limited and insufficient to offset the detrimental effects of rising temperatures and acidification. - Other options are mostly limited to reducing other stresses (water quality, tourism, fishing) and early warning systems; direct interventions such as assisted colonization and shading have been proposed but remain untested at scale.  Increased frequency and intensity of flood damage to infrastructure and settlements in Australia and New Zealand (high confidence) [Table 25-1, Boxes 25-8 and 25-9]  - Significant adaptation deficit in some regions to current flood risk. - Effective adaptation includes land-use controls and relocation as well as protection and accommodation of increased risk to ensure flexibility.  Increasing risks to coastal infrastructure and low-lying ecosystems in Australia and New Zealand, with widespread damage towards the upper end of projected sea-level-rise ranges (high confidence) [25.6, 25.10, Box 25-1]  - Adaptation deficit in some locations to current coastal erosion and flood risk. Successive building and protection cycles constrain flexible responses. - Effective adaptation includes land-use controls and ultimately relocation as well as protection and accommodation.   Key risk Wildfire-induced loss of ecosystem integrity, property loss, human morbidity, and mortality as a result of increased drying trend and temperature trend (high confidence) [26.4, 26.8, Box 26-2] Heat-related human mortality (high confidence) [26.6, 26.8]  North America Adaptation issues & prospects - Some ecosystems are more fire-adapted than others. Forest managers and municipal planners are increasingly incorporating fire protection measures (e.g., prescribed burning, introduction of resilient vegetation). Institutional capacity to support ecosystem adaptation is limited. - Adaptation of human settlements is constrained by rapid private property development in high-risk areas and by limited household-level adaptive capacity. - Agroforestry can be an effective strategy for reduction of slash and burn practices in Mexico. - Residential air conditioning (A/C) can effectively reduce risk. However, availability and usage of A/C is highly variable and is subject to complete loss during power failures. Vulnerable populations include athletes and outdoor workers for whom A/C is not available. - Community- and household-scale adaptations have the potential to reduce exposure to heat extremes via family support, early heat warning systems, cooling centers, greening, and high-albedo surfaces.  Urban floods in riverine and coastal areas, inducing property and infrastructure damage; supply chain, ecosystem, and social system disruption; public health impacts; and water quality impairment, due to sea level rise, extreme precipitation, and cyclones (high confidence) [26.2-4, 26.8]  - Implementing management of urban drainage is expensive and disruptive to urban areas. - Low-regret strategies with co-benefits include less impervious surfaces leading to more groundwater recharge, green infrastructure, and rooftop gardens. - Sea level rise increases water elevations in coastal outfalls, which impedes drainage. In many cases, older rainfall design standards are being used that need to be updated to reflect current climate conditions. - Conservation of wetlands, including mangroves, and land-use planning strategies can reduce the intensity of flood events.  Central and South America  Key risk  Adaptation issues & prospects  Water availability in semi-arid and glacier-melt-dependent regions and Central America; flooding and landslides in urban and rural areas due to extreme precipitation (high confidence)  - Integrated water resource management - Urban and rural flood management (including infrastructure), early warning systems, better weather and runoff forecasts, and infectious disease control  [27.3]  Decreased food production and food quality (medium confidence) [27.3]  - Development of new crop varieties more adapted to climate change (temperature and drought) - Offsetting of human and animal health impacts of reduced food quality - Offsetting of economic impacts of land-use change - Strengthening traditional indigenous knowledge systems and practices  Spread of vector-borne diseases in altitude and latitude (high confidence) [27.3]  - Development of early warning systems for disease control and mitigation based on climatic and other relevant inputs. Many factors augment vulnerability. - Establishing programs to extend basic public health services    Polar Regions  Key risk  Adaptation issues & prospects  Risks for freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems (high confidence) and marine ecosystems (medium confidence), due to changes in ice, snow cover, permafrost, and freshwater/ocean conditions, affecting species- habitat quality, ranges, phenology, and productivity, as well as dependent economies  - Improved understanding through scientific and indigenous knowledge, producing more effective solutions and/or technological innovations - Enhanced monitoring, regulation, and warning systems that achieve safe and sustainable use of ecosystem resources - Hunting or fishing for different species, if possible, and diversifying income sources  [28.2-4]  Risks for the health and well-being of Arctic residents, resulting from injuries and illness from the changing physical environment, food insecurity, lack of reliable and safe drinking water, and damage to infrastructure, including infrastructure in permafrost regions (high confidence)  - Co-production of more robust solutions that combine science and technology with indigenous knowledge - Enhanced observation, monitoring, and warning systems - Improved communications, education, and training - Shifting resource bases, land use, and/or settlement areas  [28.2-4]  Unprecedented challenges for northern communities due to complex inter-linkages between climate-related hazards and societal factors, particularly if rate of change is faster than social systems can adapt (high confidence) [28.2-4]  - Co-production of more robust solutions that combine science and technology with indigenous knowledge - Enhanced observation, monitoring, and warning systems - Improved communications, education, and training - Adaptive co-management responses developed through the settlement of land claims   Key risk Loss of livelihoods, coastal settlements, infrastructure, ecosystem services, and economic stability (high confidence) [29.6, 29.8, Figure 29-4]  Small Islands Adaptation issues & prospects - Significant potential exists for adaptation in islands, but additional external resources and technologies will enhance response. - Maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem functions and services and of water and food security - Efficacy of traditional community coping strategies is expected to be substantially reduced in the future.  The interaction of rising global mean sea level in the 21st century with high-water-level events will threaten low-lying coastal areas (high confidence) [29.4, Table 29-1; WGI AR5 13.5, Table 13.5]  - High ratio of coastal area to land mass will make adaptation a significant financial and resource challenge for islands. - Adaptation options include maintenance and restoration of coastal landforms and ecosystems, improved management of soils and freshwater resources, and appropriate building codes and settlement patterns.  The Ocean  Key risk  Adaptation issues & prospects  Distributional shift in fish and invertebrate species, and decrease in fisheries catch potential at low latitudes, e.g., in equatorial upwelling and coastal boundary systems and sub-tropical gyres (high confidence) [6.3, 30.5-6, Tables 6-6 and 30-3, Box CC-MB]  - Evolutionary adaptation potential of fish and invertebrate species to warming is limited as indicated by their changes in distribution to maintain temperatures. - Human adaptation options: Large-scale translocation of industrial fishing activities following the regional decreases (low latitude) vs. possibly transient increases (high latitude) in catch potential; Flexible management that can react to variability and change; Improvement of fish resilience to thermal stress by reducing other stressors such as pollution and eutrophication; Expansion of sustainable aquaculture and the development of alternative livelihoods in some regions.  Reduced biodiversity, fisheries abundance, and coastal protection by coral reefs due to heat-induced mass coral bleaching and mortality increases, exacerbated by ocean acidification, e.g., in coastal boundary systems and sub-tropical gyres (high confidence) [5.4, 6.4, 30.3, 30.5-6, Tables 6-6 and 30-3, Box CC-CR]  - Evidence of rapid evolution by corals is very limited. Some corals may migrate to higher latitudes, but entire reef systems are not expected to be able to track the high rates of temperature shifts. - Human adaptation options are limited to reducing other stresses, mainly by enhancing water quality, and limiting pressures from tourism and fishing. These options will delay human impacts of climate change by a few decades, but their efficacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress increases.  Coastal inundation and habitat loss due to sea level rise, extreme events, changes in precipitation, and reduced ecological resilience, e.g., in coastal boundary systems and sub-tropical gyres (medium to high confidence) [5.5, 30.5-6, Tables 6-6 and 30-3, Box CC-CR]  - Human adaptation options are limited to reducing other stresses, mainly by reducing pollution and limiting pressures from tourism, fishing, physical destruction, and unsustainable aquaculture. - Reducing deforestation and increasing reforestation of river catchments and coastal areas to retain sediments and nutrients - Increased mangrove, coral reef, and seagrass protection, and restoration to protect numerous ecosystem goods and services such as coastal protection, tourist value, and fish habitat    C: MANAGING FUTURE RISKS AND BUILDING RESILIENCE Managing the risks of climate change involves adaptation and mitigation decisions with implications for future generations, economies, and environments. This section evaluates adaptation as a means to build resilience and to adjust to climate-change impacts. It also considers limits to adaptation, climate-resilient pathways, and the role of transformation. See Figure .8 for an overview of responses for addressing risk related to climate change.  C-1. Principles for Effective Adaptation Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach for reducing risks appropriate across all settings (high confidence). Effective risk reduction and adaptation strategies consider the dynamics of vulnerability and exposure and their linkages with socioeconomic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Specific examples of responses to climate change are presented in Table .1.Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments (high confidence). National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and subnational governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification, and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks, and financial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households, and civil society and in managing risk information and financing (medium evidence, high agreement).A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability (high confidence). Strategies include actions with co-benefits for other objectives. Available strategies and actions can increase resilience across a range of possible future climates while helping to improve human health, livelihoods, social and economic well-being, and  environmental quality. See Table .1. Integration of adaptation into planning and decision making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction.Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives, and risk perceptions (high confidence). Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts, and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples' holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation.Decision support is most effective when it is sensitive to context and the diversity of decision types, decision processes, and constituencies (robust evidence, high agreement). Organizations bridging science and decision making, including climate services, play an important role in the communication, transfer, and development of climate-related knowledge, including translation, engagement, and knowledge exchange (medium evidence, high agreement).Existing and emerging economic instruments can foster adaptation by providing incentives for anticipating and reducing impacts (medium confidence). Instruments include public-private finance partnerships, loans, payments for environmental services, improved resource pricing, charges and subsidies, norms and regulations, and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms. Risk financing mechanisms in the public and private sector, such as insurance and risk pools, can contribute to increasing resilience, but without attention to major design challenges, they can also provide disincentives, cause market failure, and decrease equity. Governments often play key roles as regulators, providers, or insurers of last resort.Constraints can interact to impede adaptation planning and implementation (high confidence). Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties   about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Another constraint includes insufficient research, monitoring, and observation and the finance to maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes. Poor planning, overemphasizing short-term outcomes, or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation (medium evidence, high agreement). Maladaptation can increase the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future, or the vulnerability of other people, places, or sectors. Some near-term responses to increasing risks related to climate change may also limit future choices. For example, enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection measures.Limited evidence indicates a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation (medium confidence). There is a need for a better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding, and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods, and coverage (high confidence).Significant co-benefits, synergies, and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very high confidence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use, and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include (i) improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.C-2. Climate-resilient Pathways and Transformation Climate-resilient pathways are sustainable-development trajectories that combine adaptation and mitigation to reduce climate change and its impacts. They include iterative processes to ensure that effective risk management can be implemented and sustained. See Figure .9.Prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development are related fundamentally to what the world accomplishes with climate-change mitigation (high confidence). Since mitigation reduces the rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future.Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high confidence). Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable risks for an actor's objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socioeconomic constraints. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Transformations in economic, social, technological, and political decisions and actions can enable climate-resilient pathways (high  confidence). Specific examples are presented in Table .1. Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-  resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being, and  responsible environmental management. At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country's own  visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. Transformations to    sustainability are considered to benefit from iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation.  Low resilience High risk  Figure .9 | Opportunity space and climate-resilient pathways. (A) Our world [Sections A-1 and B-1] is threatened by multiple stressors that impinge on resilience from many directions, represented here simply as biophysical and social stressors. Stressors include climate change, climate variability, land-use change, degradation of ecosystems, poverty and inequality, and cultural factors. (B) Opportunity space [Sections A-2, A-3, B-2, C-1, and C-2] refers to decision points and pathways that lead to a range of (C) possible futures [Sections C and B-3] with differing levels of resilience and risk. (D) Decision points result in actions or failures-to-act throughout the opportunity space, and together they constitute the process of managing or failing to manage risks related to climate change. (E) Climate-resilient pathways (in green) within the opportunity space lead to a more resilient world through adaptive learning, increasing scientific knowledge, effective adaptation and mitigation measures, and other choices that reduce risks. (F) Pathways that lower resilience (in red) can involve insufficient mitigation, maladaptation, failure to learn and use knowledge, and other actions that lower resilience; and they can be irreversible in terms of possible futures.

IPCC-2013-7.txt,"Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  A. Introduction 1. The Working Group III contribution to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) focuses on new literature on the scientific, technological, environmental, economic and social aspects of mitigation of climate change, published since the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and the Special Reports on CO2 Capture and Storage (SRCCS) and on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System (SROC). The following summary is organised into six sections after this introduction: - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trends - Mitigation in the short and medium term, across different economic sectors (until 2030) - Mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2030) - Policies, measures and instruments to mitigate climate change - Sustainable development and climate change mitigation - Gaps in knowledge. References to the corresponding chapter sections are indicated at each paragraph in square brackets. An explanation of terms, acronyms and chemical symbols used in this SPM can be found in the glossary to the main report. B. Greenhouse gas emission trends 2. Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times, with an increase of 70% between 1970 and 2004 (high agreement, much evidence). - Since pre-industrial times, increasing emissions of GHGs due to human activities have led to a marked increase in atmospheric GHG concentrations [1.3; Working Group I SPM]. - Between 1970 and 2004, global emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6, weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), have increased by 70% (24%  between 1990 and 2004), from 28.7 to 49 Gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO2-eq) (see Figure SPM.1). The emissions of these gases have increased at different rates. CO2 emissions have grown between 1970 and 2004 by about 80% (28% between 1990 and 2004) and represented 77% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2004. - The largest growth in global GHG emissions between 1970 and 2004 has come from the energy supply sector (an increase of 145%). The growth in direct emissions from transport in this period was 120%, industry 65% and land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF) 40%. Between 1970 and 1990 direct emissions from agriculture grew by 27% and from buildings by 26%, and the latter remained at approximately at 1990 levels thereafter. However, the buildings sector has a high level of electricity use and hence the total of direct and indirect emissions in this sector is much higher (75%) than direct emissions [1.3, 6.1, 11.3, Figures 1.1 and 1.3]. - The effect on global emissions of the decrease in global energy intensity (-33%) during 1970 to 2004 has been smaller than the combined effect of global per capita income growth (77 %) and global population growth (69%); both drivers of increasing energy-related CO2 emissions (Figure SPM.2). The long-term trend of a declining carbon intensity of energy supply reversed after 2000. Differences in terms of per capita income, per capita emissions, and energy intensity among countries remain significant. (Figure SPM.3). In 2004 UNFCCC Annex I countries held a 20% share in world population, produced 57% of world Gross Domestic Product based on Purchasing Power Parity (GDPppp), and accounted for 46% of global GHG emissions (Figure SPM.3) [1.3]. - The emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS) controlled under the Montreal Protocol, which are also GHGs, have declined significantly since the 1990s. By 2004 the emissions of these gases were about 20% of their 1990 level [1.3]. - A range of policies, including those on climate change, energy security, and sustainable development, have been effective in reducing GHG emissions in different sectors and many countries. The scale of such measures, however, has not yet been large enough to counteract the global growth in emissions [1.3, 12.2].  1 Each headline statement has an ""agreement/evidence"" assessment attached that is supported by the bullets underneath. This does not necessarily mean that this level of ""agreement/evidence""applies to each bullet. Endbox 1 provides an explanation of this representation of uncertainty. 2 The definition of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) is the amount of CO2 emission that would cause the same radiative forcing as an emitted amount of a well mixed greenhouse gas or a mixture of well mixed greenhouse gases, all multiplied with their respective GWPs to take into account the differing times they remain in the atmosphere [WGI AR4 Glossary]. 3 Direct emissions in each sector do not include emissions from the electricity sector for the electricity consumed in the building, industry and agricultural sectors or of the emissions from refinery operations supplying fuel to the transport sector. 4 The term ""land use, land use change and forestry"" is used here to describe the aggregated emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O from deforestation, biomass and burning, decay of biomass from logging and deforestation, decay of peat and peat fires [1.3.1]. This is broader than emissions from deforestation, which is included as a subset. The emissions reported here do not include carbon uptake (removals). 5 This trend is for the total LULUCF emissions, of which emissions from deforestation are a subset and, owing to large data uncertainties, is significantly less certain than for other sectors. The rate of deforestation globally was slightly lower in the 2000-2005 period than in the 1990-2000 period [9.2.1]. 6 The GDPppp metric is used for illustrative purposes only for this report. For an explanation of PPP and Market Exchange Rate (MER) GDP calculations, see footnote 12. 7 Halons, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and methyl bromide (CH3Br). 8 Energy security refers to security of energy supply.     Figure SPM.1: Global Warming Potential (GWP) weighted global greenhouse gas emissions 1970-2004. 100 year GWPs from IPCC 1996 (SAR) were used to convert emissions to CO2-eq. (cf. UNFCCC reporting guidelines). CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6 from all sources are included. The two CO2 emission categories reflect CO2 emissions from energy production and use (second from bottom) and from land use changes (third from the bottom) [Figure 1.1a]. Notes: 1. Other N2O includes industrial processes, deforestation/savannah burning, waste water and waste incineration. 2. Other is CH4 from industrial processes and savannah burning. 3. Including emissions from bioenergy production and use 4.

As well as traditional biomass use at 10% of total, assuming 90% is from sustainable biomass production. Corrected for 10% carbon of biomass that is assumed to remain as charcoal after combustion. 6. For large-scale forest and scrubland biomass burning averaged data for 1997-2002 based on Global Fire Emissions Data base satellite data. 7. Cement production and natural gas flaring. 8. Fossil fuel use includes emissions from feedstocks. 3. With current climate change mitigation policies and related sustainable development practices, global GHG emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades (high agreement, much evidence). - The SRES (non-mitigation) scenarios project an increase of baseline global GHG emissions by a range of 9.7 GtCO2-eq to 36.7 GtCO2-eq (25-90%) between 2000 and 2030 (Box SPM.1 and Figure SPM.4). In these scenarios, fossil fuels are projected to maintain their dominant position in the global energy mix to 2030 and beyond. Hence CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2030 from energy use are projected to grow 40 to 110% over that period. Two thirds to three quarters of this increase in energy CO2 emissions is projected to come from nonAnnex I regions, with their average per capita energy CO2 emissions being projected to remain substantially lower (2.8-5.1 tCO2/cap) than those in Annex I regions (9.6-15.1 tCO2/cap) by 2030. According to SRES scenarios, their economies are projected to have a lower energy use per unit of GDP (6.2 - 9.9 MJ/US$ GDP) than that of non-Annex I countries (11.0 - 21.6 MJ/US$ GDP). [1.3, 3.2]  4. Baseline emissions scenarios published since SRES10, are comparable in range to those presented in the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) (25- 135 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2100, see Figure SPM.4) (high agreement, much evidence). - Studies since SRES used lower values for some drivers for emissions, notably population projections. However, for those studies incorporating these new population projections, changes in other drivers, such as economic growth, resulted in little change in overall emission levels. Economic growth projections for Africa, Latin America and the Middle East to 2030 in post-SRES baseline scenarios are lower than in SRES, but this has only minor effects on global economic growth and overall emissions [3.2].  - Representation of aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions, including sulphur dioxide, black carbon, and organic carbon, which have a net cooling effect11 has improved. Generally, they are projected to be lower than reported in SRES [3.2]. - Available studies indicate that the choice of exchange rate for GDP (MER or PPP) does not appreciably affect the projected emissions, when used consistently12. The differences, if any, are small compared to the uncertainties caused by assumptions on other parameters in the scenarios, e.g. technological change [3.2].  Box SPM.1: The emission scenarios of the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1. The A1 storyline and scenario family describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Major underlying themes are convergence among regions, capacity building and increased cultural and social interactions, with a substantial reduction in regional differences in per capita income. The A1 scenario family develops into three groups that describe alternative directions of technological change in the energy system. The three A1 groups are distinguished by their technological emphasis: fossil intensive (A1FI), non fossil energy sources (A1T), or a balance across all sources (A1B) (where balanced is defined as not relying too heavily on one particular energy source, on the assumption that similar improvement rates apply to all energy supply and end use technologies). A2. The A2 storyline and scenario family describes a very heterogeneous world. The underlying theme is self reliance and preservation of local identities. Fertility patterns across regions converge very slowly, which results in continuously increasing population. Economic development is primarily regionally oriented and per capita economic growth and technological change more fragmented and slower than other storylines. B1. The B1 storyline and scenario family describes a convergent world with the same global population, that peaks in midcentury and declines thereafter, as in the A1 storyline, but with rapid change in economic structures toward a service and information economy, with reductions in material intensity and the introduction of clean and resource efficient technologies. The emphasis is on global solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability, including improved equity, but without additional climate initiatives. B2. The B2 storyline and scenario family describes a world in which the emphasis is on local solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. It is a world with continuously increasing global population, at a rate lower than A2, intermediate levels of economic development, and less rapid and more diverse technological change than in the B1 and A1 storylines. While the scenario is also oriented towards environmental protection and social equity, it focuses on local and regional levels. An illustrative scenario was chosen for each of the six scenario groups A1B, A1FI, A1T, A2, B1 and B2. All should be considered equally sound. The SRES scenarios do not include additional climate initiatives, which means that no scenarios are included that explicitly assume implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or the emissions targets of the Kyoto Protocol. This box summarizing the SRES scenarios is taken from the Third Assessment Report and has been subject to prior line by line approval by the Panel. Box SPM.2: Mitigation potential and analytical approaches The concept of ""mitigation potential"" has been developed to assess the scale of GHG reductions that could be made, relative to emission baselines, for a given level of carbon price (expressed in cost per unit of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions avoided or reduced). Mitigation potential is further differentiated in terms of ""market potential"" and ""economic potential"". Market potential is the mitigation potential based on private costs and private discount rates13, which might be expected to occur under forecast market conditions, including policies and measures currently in place, noting that barriers limit actual uptake [2.4]. Economic potential is the mitigation potential, which takes into account social costs and benefits and social discount rates14, assuming that market efficiency is improved by policies and measures and barriers are removed [2.4]. Studies of market potential can be used to inform policy makers about mitigation potential with existing policies and barriers, while studies of economic potentials show what might be achieved if appropriate new and additional policies were put into place to remove barriers and include social costs and benefits. The economic potential is therefore generally greater than the market potential. Mitigation potential is estimated using different types of approaches. There are two broad classes - ""bottom-up"" and ""topdown"" approaches, which primarily have been used to assess the economic potential. Bottom-up studies are based on assessment of mitigation options, emphasizing specific technologies and regulations. They are typically sectoral studies taking the macro-economy as unchanged. Sector estimates have been aggregated, as in the TAR, to provide an estimate of global mitigation potential for this assessment. Top-down studies assess the economy-wide potential of mitigation options. They use globally consistent frameworks and aggregated information about mitigation options and capture macro-economic and market feedbacks. Bottom-up and top-down models have become more similar since the TAR as top-down models have incorporated more technological mitigation options and bottom-up models have incorporated more macroeconomic and market feedbacks as well as adopting barrier analysis into their model structures. Bottom-up studies in particular are useful for the assessment of specific policy options at sectoral level, e.g. options for improving energy efficiency, while top-down studies are useful for assessing cross-sectoral and economy-wide climate change policies, such as carbon taxes and stabilization policies. However, current bottom-up and top-down studies of economic potential have limitations in considering life-style choices, and in including all externalities such as local air pollution. They have limited representation of some regions, countries, sectors, gases, and barriers. The projected mitigation costs do not take into account potential benefits of avoided climate change. Box SPM.3: Assumptions in studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs Studies on mitigation portfolios and macro-economic costs assessed in this report are based on top-down modelling. Most models use a global least cost approach to mitigation portfolios and with universal emissions trading, assuming transparent markets, no transaction cost, and thus perfect implementation of mitigation measures throughout the 21st century. Costs are given for a specific point in time. Global modelled costs will increase if some regions, sectors (e.g. land-use), options or gases are excluded. Global modelled costs will decrease with lower baselines, use of revenues from carbon taxes and auctioned permits, and if induced technological learning is included. These models do not consider climate benefits and generally also co-benefits of mitigation measures, or equity issues. Box SPM.4: Modelling induced technological change Relevant literature implies that policies and measures may induce technological change. Remarkable progress has been achieved in applying approaches based on induced technological change to stabilisation studies; however, conceptual issues remain. In the models that adopt these approaches, projected costs for a given stabilization level are reduced; the reductions are greater at lower stabilisation levels.   C. Mitigation in the short and medium term (until 2030) 5. Both bottom-up and top-down studies indicate that there is substantial economic potential for the mitigation of global GHG emissions over the coming decades, that could offset the projected growth of global emissions or reduce emissions below current levels (high agreement, much evidence). Uncertainties in the estimates are shown as ranges in the tables below to reflect the ranges of baselines, rates of technological change and other factors that are specific to the different approaches. Furthermore, uncertainties also arise from the limited information for global coverage of countries, sectors and gases. Bottom-up studies: - In 2030, the economic potential estimated for this assessment from bottom-up approaches (see Box SPM.2) is presented in Table SPM.1 below and Figure SPM.5A. For reference: emissions in 2000 were equal to 43 GtCO2-eq. [11.3]:  - Studies suggest that mitigation opportunities with net negative costs15 have the potential to reduce emissions by around 6 GtCO2-eq/yr in 2030. Realizing these requires dealing with implementation barriers [11.3]. - No one sector or technology can address the entire mitigation challenge. All assessed sectors contribute to the total (see Figure SPM.6). The key mitigation technologies and practices for the respective sectors are shown in Table SPM 3 [4.3, 4.4, 5.4, 6.5, 7.5, 8.4, 9.4, 10.4]. Top-down studies: - Top-down studies calculate an emission reduction for 2030 as presented in Table SPM.2 below and Figure SPM.5B. The global economic potentials found in the top-down studies are in line with bottom-up studies (see Box SPM.2), though there are considerable differences at the sectoral level [3.6]. - The estimates in Table SPM.2 were derived from stabilization scenarios, i.e., runs towards long-run stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentration [3.6].  Table SPM.3: Key mitigation technologies and practices by sector. Sectors and technologies are listed in no particular order. Non-technological practices, such as lifestyle changes, which are cross-cutting, are not included in this table (but are addressed in paragraph 7 in this SPM). Figure SPM.6: Estimated sectoral economic potential for global mitigation for different regions as a function of carbon price in 2030 from bottom-up studies, compared to the respective baselines assumed in the sector assessments. A full explanation of the derivation of this figure is found in Section 11.3. Notes: 1. The ranges for global economic potentials as assessed in each sector are shown by vertical lines. The ranges are based on end-use allocations of emissions, meaning that emissions of electricity use are counted towards the end-use sectors and not to the energy supply sector. 2. The estimated potentials have been constrained by the availability of studies particularly at high carbon price levels. 3. Sectors used different baselines. For industry the SRES B2 baseline was taken, for energy supply and transport the WEO 2004 baseline was used; the building sector is based on a baseline in between SRES B2 and A1B; for waste, SRES A1B driving forces were used to construct a waste specific baseline, agriculture and forestry used baselines that mostly used B2 driving forces. 4. Only global totals for transport are shown because international aviation is included [5.4]. 5. Categories excluded are: non-CO2 emissions in buildings and transport, part of material efficiency options, heat production and cogeneration in energy supply, heavy duty vehicles, shipping and high-occupancy passenger transport, most high-cost options for buildings, wastewater treatment, emission reduction from coal mines and gas pipelines, fluorinated gases from energy supply and transport. The underestimation of the total economic potential from these emissions is of the order of 10-15%.  6. In 2030 macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation, consistent with emissions trajectories towards stabilization between 445 and 710 ppm CO2-eq, are estimated at between a 3% decrease of global GDP and a small increase, compared to the baseline (see Table SPM.4). However, regional costs may differ significantly from global averages (high agreement, medium evidence) (see Box SPM.3 for the methodologies and assumptions of these results). - The majority of studies conclude that reduction of GDP relative to the GDP baseline increases with the stringency of the stabilization target. - Depending on the existing tax system and spending of the revenues, modelling studies indicate that costs may be substantially lower under the assumption that revenues from carbon taxes or auctioned permits under an emission trading system are used to promote lowcarbon technologies or reform of existing taxes [11.4].  - Studies that assume the possibility that climate change policy induces enhanced technological change also give lower costs. However, this may require higher upfront investment in order to achieve costs reductions thereafter (see Box SPM.4) [3.3, 3.4, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6]. - Although most models show GDP losses, some show GDP gains because they assume that baselines are non-optimal and mitigation policies improve market efficiencies, or they assume that more technological change may be induced by mitigation policies. Examples of market inefficiencies include unemployed resources, distortionary taxes and/or subsidies [3.3, 11.4]. - A multi-gas approach and inclusion of carbon sinks generally reduces costs substantially compared to CO2 emission abatement only [3.3]. - Regional costs are largely dependent on the assumed stabilization level and baseline scenario. The allocation regime is also important, but for most countries to a lesser extent than the stabilization level [11.4, 13.3].    Table SPM.4: Estimated global macro-economic costs in 2030a) for least-cost trajectories towards different long-term stabilization levels.b), c)  Notes: a) For a given stabilization level, GDP reduction would increase over time in most models after 2030. Long-term costs also become more uncertain. [Figure 3.25] b) Results based on studies using various baselines. c) Studies vary in terms of the point in time stabilization is achieved; generally this is in 2100 or later. d) This is global GDP based market exchange rates. e) The median and the 10th and 90th percentile range of the analyzed data are given. f) The calculation of the reduction of the annual growth rate is based on the average reduction during the period till 2030 that would result in the indicated GDP decrease in 2030. g) The number of studies that report GDP results is relatively small and they generally use low baselines.  7. Changes in lifestyle and behaviour patterns can contribute to climate change mitigation across all sectors. Management practices can also have a positive role (high agreement, medium evidence). - Lifestyle changes can reduce GHG emissions. Changes in lifestyles and consumption patterns that emphasize resource conservation can contribute to developing a low-carbon economy that is both equitable and sustainable [4.1, 6.7]. - Education and training programmes can help overcome barriers to the market acceptance of energy efficiency, particularly in combination with other measures [Table 6.6]. - Changes in occupant behaviour, cultural patterns and consumer choice and use of technologies can result in considerable reduction in CO2 emissions related to energy use in buildings [6.7]. - Transport Demand Management, which includes urban planning (that can reduce the demand for travel) and provision of information and educational techniques (that can reduce car usage and lead to an efficient driving style) can support GHG mitigation [5.1]. - In industry, management tools that include staff training, reward systems, regular feedback, documentation of existing practices can help overcome industrial organization barriers, reduce energy use, and GHG emissions [7.3].  - Including co-benefits other than health, such as increased energy security, and increased agricultural production and reduced pressure on natural ecosystems, due to decreased tropospheric ozone concentrations, would further enhance cost savings [11.8]. - Integrating air pollution abatement and climate change mitigation policies offers potentially large cost reductions compared to treating those policies in isolation [11.8]. 9. Literature since TAR confirms that there may be effects from Annex I countries' action on the global economy and global emissions, although the scale of carbon leakage remains uncertain (high agreement, medium evidence). - Fossil fuel exporting nations (in both Annex I and nonAnnex I countries) may expect, as indicated in TAR16, lower demand and prices and lower GDP growth due to mitigation policies. The extent of this spill over17 depends strongly on assumptions related to policy decisions and oil market conditions [11.7]. - Critical uncertainties remain in the assessment of carbon leakage18. Most equilibrium modelling support the conclusion in the TAR of economy-wide leakage from Kyoto action in the order of 5-20%, which would be less if competitive low-emissions technologies were effectively diffused [11.7] .  8. While studies use different methodologies, in all analyzed world regions near-term health co-benefits from reduced air pollution as a result of actions to reduce GHG emissions can be substantial and may offset a substantial fraction of mitigation costs (high agreement, much evidence).  10. New energy infrastructure investments in developing countries, upgrades of energy infrastructure in industrialized countries, and policies that promote energy security, can, in many cases, create opportunities to achieve GHG emission reductions19 compared to baseline scenarios. Additional co-benefits are country-  specific but often include air pollution abatement, balance of trade improvement, provision of modern energy services to rural areas and employment (high agreement, much evidence). - Future energy infrastructure investment decisions, expected to total over 20 trillion US$20 between now and 2030, will have long term impacts on GHG emissions, because of the long life-times of energy plants and other infrastructure capital stock. The widespread diffusion of low-carbon technologies may take many decades, even if early investments in these technologies are made attractive. Initial estimates show that returning global energy-related CO2 emissions to 2005 levels by 2030 would require a large shift in the pattern of investment, although the net additional investment required ranges from negligible to 5-10% [4.1, 4.4, 11.6]. - It is often more cost-effective to invest in end-use energy efficiency improvement than in increasing energy supply to satisfy demand for energy services. Efficiency improvement has a positive effect on energy security, local and regional air pollution abatement, and employment [4.2, 4.3, 6.5, 7.7, 11.3, 11.8]. - Renewable energy generally has a positive effect on energy security, employment and on air quality. Given costs relative to other supply options, renewable electricity, which accounted for 18% of the electricity supply in 2005, can have a 30-35% share of the total electricity supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50 US$/tCO2-eq [4.3, 4.4, 11.3, 11.6, 11.8]. - The higher the market prices of fossil fuels, the more low-carbon alternatives will be competitive, although price volatility will be a disincentive for investors. Higher priced conventional oil resources, on the other hand, may be replaced by high carbon alternatives such as from oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing GHG emissions, unless production plants are equipped with CCS [4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5]. - Given costs relative to other supply options, nuclear power, which accounted for 16% of the electricity supply in 2005, can have an 18% share of the total electricity supply in 2030 at carbon prices up to 50 US$/tCO2-eq, but safety, weapons proliferation and waste remain as constraints [4.2, 4.3, 4.4]21. - CCS in underground geological formations is a new technology with the potential to make an important contribution to mitigation by 2030. Technical, economic and regulatory developments will affect the actual contribution [4.3, 4.4, 7.3].  11. There are multiple mitigation options in the transport sector19, but their effect may be counteracted by growth in the sector. Mitigation options are faced with many barriers, such as consumer preferences and lack of policy frameworks (medium agreement, medium evidence). - Improved vehicle efficiency measures, leading to fuel savings, in many cases have net benefits (at least for light-duty vehicles), but the market potential is much lower than the economic potential due to the influence of other consumer considerations, such as performance and size. There is not enough information to assess the mitigation potential for heavy-duty vehicles. Market forces alone, including rising fuel costs, are therefore not expected to lead to significant emission reductions [5.3, 5.4]. - Biofuels might play an important role in addressing GHG emissions in the transport sector, depending on their production pathway. Biofuels used as gasoline and diesel fuel additives/substitutes are projected to grow to 3% of total transport energy demand in the baseline in 2030. This could increase to about 5-10%, depending on future oil and carbon prices, improvements in vehicle efficiency and the success of technologies to utilise cellulose biomass [5.3, 5.4]. - Modal shifts from road to rail and to inland and coastal shipping and from low-occupancy to high-occupancy passenger transportation22, as well as land-use, urban planning and non-motorized transport offer opportunities for GHG mitigation, depending on local conditions and policies [5.3, 5.5]. - Medium term mitigation potential for CO2 emissions from the aviation sector can come from improved fuel efficiency, which can be achieved through a variety of means, including technology, operations and air traffic management. However, such improvements are expected to only partially offset the growth of aviation emissions. Total mitigation potential in the sector would also need to account for non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation emissions [5.3, 5.4]. - Realizing emissions reductions in the transport sector is often a co-benefit of addressing traffic congestion, air quality and energy security [5.5]. 12. Energy efficiency options19 for new and existing buildings could considerably reduce CO2 emissions with net economic benefit. Many barriers exist against tapping this potential, but there are also large co-benefits (high agreement, much evidence). - By 2030, about 30% of the projected GHG emissions in the building sector can be avoided with net economic benefit [6.4, 6.5].   - Energy efficient buildings, while limiting the growth of CO2 emissions, can also improve indoor and outdoor air quality, improve social welfare and enhance energy security [6.6, 6.7]. - Opportunities for realising GHG reductions in the building sector exist worldwide. However, multiple barriers make it difficult to realise this potential. These barriers include availability of technology, financing, poverty, higher costs of reliable information, limitations inherent in building designs and an appropriate portfolio of policies and programs [6.7, 6.8]. - The magnitude of the above barriers is higher in the developing countries and this makes it more difficult for them to achieve the GHG reduction potential of the building sector [6.7]. 13. The economic potential in the industrial sector19 is predominantly located in energy intensive industries. Full use of available mitigation options is not being made in either industrialized or developing nations (high agreement, much evidence). - Many industrial facilities in developing countries are new and include the latest technology with the lowest specific emissions. However, many older, inefficient facilities remain in both industrialized and developing countries. Upgrading these facilities can deliver significant emission reductions [7.1, 7.3, 7.4]. - The slow rate of capital stock turnover, lack of financial and technical resources, and limitations in the ability of firms, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to access and absorb technological information are key barriers to full use of available mitigation options [7.6].  - There is no universally applicable list of mitigation practices; practices need to be evaluated for individual agricultural systems and settings [8.4]. - Biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops can be an important bioenergy feedstock, but its contribution to mitigation depends on demand for bioenergy from transport and energy supply, on water availability, and on requirements of land for food and fibre production. Widespread use of agricultural land for biomass production for energy may compete with other land uses and can have positive and negative environmental impacts and implications for food security [8.4, 8.8]. 15. Forest-related mitigation activities can considerably reduce emissions from sources and increase CO2 removals by sinks at low costs19, and can be designed to create synergies with adaptation and sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence)23. - About 65% of the total mitigation potential (up to 100 US$/tCO2-eq) is located in the tropics and about 50% of the total could be achieved by reducing emissions from deforestation [9.4]. - Climate change can affect the mitigation potential of the forest sector (i.e., native and planted forests) and is expected to be different for different regions and subregions, both in magnitude and direction [9.5]. - Forest-related mitigation options can be designed and implemented to be compatible with adaptation, and can have substantial co-benefits in terms of employment, income generation, biodiversity and watershed conservation, renewable energy supply and poverty alleviation [9.5, 9.6, 9.7].  14. Agricultural practices collectively can make a significant contribution at low cost19 to increasing soil carbon sinks, to GHG emission reductions, and by contributing biomass feedstocks for energy use (medium agreement, medium evidence). - A large proportion of the mitigation potential of agriculture (excluding bioenergy) arises from soil carbon sequestration, which has strong synergies with sustainable agriculture and generally reduces vulnerability to climate change [8.4, 8.5, 8.8]. - Stored soil carbon may be vulnerable to loss through both land management change and climate change [8.10]. - Considerable mitigation potential is also available from reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions in some agricultural systems [8.4, 8.5].  16. Post-consumer waste24 is a small contributor to global GHG emissions25 (<5%), but the waste sector can positively contribute to GHG mitigation at low cost19 and promote sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence). - Existing waste management practices can provide effective mitigation of GHG emissions from this sector: a wide range of mature, environmentally effective technologies are commercially available to mitigate emissions and provide co-benefits for improved public health and safety, soil protection and pollution prevention, and local energy supply [10.3, 10.4, 10.5]. - Waste minimization and recycling provide important indirect mitigation benefits through the conservation of energy and materials [10.4].   - Lack of local capital is a key constraint for waste and wastewater management in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. Lack of expertise on sustainable technology is also an important barrier [10.6]. 17. Geo-engineering options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere, or blocking sunlight by bringing material into the upper atmosphere, remain largely speculative and unproven, and with the risk of unknown side-effects. Reliable cost estimates for these options have not been published (medium agreement, limited evidence) [11.2]. D. Mitigation in the long term (after 2030) 18. In order to stabilize the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, emissions would need to peak and decline thereafter. The lower the stabilization level, the more quickly this peak and decline would need to occur. Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels (see Table SPM.5, and Figure SPM. 8)26 (high agreement, much evidence).  - Recent studies using multi-gas reduction have explored lower stabilization levels than reported in TAR [3.3]. - Assessed studies contain a range of emissions profiles for achieving stabilization of GHG concentrations27. Most of these studies used a least cost approach and include both early and delayed emission reductions (Figure SPM.7) [Box SPM.2]. Table SPM.5 summarizes the required emissions levels for different groups of stabilization concentrations and the associated equilibrium global mean temperature increase, using the `best estimate' of climate sensitivity (see also Figure SPM.8 for the likely range of uncertainty)29. Stabilization at lower concentration and related equilibrium temperature levels advances the date when emissions need to peak, and requires greater emissions reductions by 2050 [3.3].  Table SPM.5: Characteristics of post-TAR stabilization scenarios [Table TS 2, 3.10]a)  a) The understanding of the climate system response to radiative forcing as well as feedbacks is assessed in detail in the AR4 WGI Report. Feedbacks between the carbon cycle and climate change affect the required mitigation for a particular stabilization level of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. These feedbacks are expected to increase the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remains in the atmosphere as the climate system warms. Therefore, the emission reductions to meet a particular stabilization level reported in the mitigation studies assessed here might be underestimated. b) The best estimate of climate sensitivity is 3-C [WG 1 SPM]. c) Note that global mean temperature at equilibrium is different from expected global mean temperature at the time of stabilization of GHG concentrations due to the inertia of the climate system. For the majority of scenarios assessed, stabilisation of GHG concentrations occurs between 2100 and 2150. d) Ranges correspond to the 15th to 85th percentile of the post-TAR scenario distribution. CO2 emissions are shown so multi-gas scenarios can be compared with CO2- only scenarios.  Figure SPM.7: Emissions pathways of mitigation scenarios for alternative categories of stabilization levels (Category I to VI as defined in the box in each panel). The path- ways are for CO2 emissions only. Light brown shaded areas give the CO2 emissions for the post-TAR emissions scenarios. Green shaded and hatched areas depict the range of more than 80 TAR stabilization scenarios. Base year emissions may differ between models due to differences in sector and industry coverage. To reach the lower stabilization levels some scenarios deploy removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (negative emissions) using technologies such as biomass energy production utilizing carbon capture and storage. [Figure 3.17]  19. The range of stabilization levels assessed can be achieved by deployment of a portfolio of technologies that are currently available and those that are expected to be commercialised in coming decades. This assumes that appropriate and effective incentives are in place for development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies and for addressing related barriers (high agreement, much evidence). - The contribution of different technologies to emission reductions required for stabilization will vary over time, region and stabilization level. o Energy efficiency plays a key role across many scenarios for most regions and timescales.  o For lower stabilization levels, scenarios put more emphasis on the use of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and the use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS). In these scenarios improvements of carbon intensity of energy supply and the whole economy need to be much faster than in the past. o Including non-CO2 and CO2 land-use and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness for achieving stabilization. Modern bioenergy could contribute substantially to the share of renewable energy in the mitigation portfolio.   o For illustrative examples of portfolios of mitigation options, see figure SPM.9 [3.3, 3.4]. • Investments in and world-wide deployment of low- GHG emission technologies as well as technology improvements through public and private Research Development & Demonstration (RD&D) would be required for achieving stabilization targets as well as cost reduction. The lower the stabilization levels, especially those of 550 ppm CO2-eq or lower, the greater the need for more efficient RD&D efforts and investment in new technologies during the next few decades. This requires that barriers to development, acquisition, deployment and diffusion of technologies are effectively addressed. - Appropriate incentives could address these barriers and help realize the goals across a wide portfolio of technologies. [2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 4.3, 4.4, 4.6]. 20. In 205030 global average macro-economic costs for multi-gas mitigation towards stabilization between 710 and 445 ppm CO2-eq, are between a 1% gain to a 5.5% decrease of global GDP (see Table SPM.6). For specific countries and sectors, costs vary considerably from the global average. (See Box SPM.3 and SPM.4 for the methodologies and assumptions and paragraph 5 for explanation of negative costs) (high agreement, medium evidence). 21. Decision-making about the appropriate level of global mitigation over time involves an iterative risk management process that includes mitigation and adaptation, taking into account actual and avoided climate change damages, co-benefits, sustainability, equity, and attitudes to risk. Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate risks of delay [high agreement, much evidence]. - Limited and early analytical results from integrated analyses of the costs and benefits of mitigation indicate that these are broadly comparable in magnitude, but do not as yet permit an unambiguous determination of an emissions pathway or stabilization level where benefits exceed costs [3.5].  - Integrated assessment of the economic costs and benefits of different mitigation pathways shows that the economically optimal timing and level of mitigation depends upon the uncertain shape and character of the assumed climate change damage cost curve. To illustrate this dependency: o if the climate change damage cost curve grows slowly and regularly, and there is good foresight (which increases the potential for timely adaptation), later and less stringent mitigation is economically justified; o alternatively if the damage cost curve increases steeply, or contains non-linearities (e.g. vulnerability thresholds or even small probabilities of catastrophic events), earlier and more stringent mitigation is economically justified [3.6]. - Climate sensitivity is a key uncertainty for mitigation scenarios that aim to meet a specific temperature level. Studies show that if climate sensitivity is high then the timing and level of mitigation is earlier and more stringent than when it is low [3.5, 3.6]. - Delayed emission reductions lead to investments that lock in more emission-intensive infrastructure and development pathways. This significantly constrains the opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels (as shown in Table SPM.5) and increases the risk of more severe climate change impacts [3.4, 3.1, 3.5, 3.6]   E. Policies, measures and instruments to mitigate climate change 22. A wide variety of national policies and instruments are available to governments to create the incentives for mitigation action. Their applicability depends on national circumstances and an understanding of their interactions, but experience from implementation in various countries and sectors shows there are advantages and disadvantages for any given instrument (high agreement, much evidence). - Four main criteria are used to evaluate policies and instruments: environmental effectiveness, cost effectiveness, distributional effects, including equity, and institutional feasibility [13.2]. - All instruments can be designed well or poorly, and be stringent or lax. In addition, monitoring to improve implementation is an important issue for all instruments. General findings about the performance of policies are: [7.9, 12.2,13.2] o Integrating climate policies in broader development policies makes implementation and overcoming barriers easier. o Regulations and standards generally provide some certainty about emission levels. They may be preferable to other instruments when information or other barriers prevent producers and consumers from responding to price signals. However, they may not induce innovations and more advanced technologies. o Taxes and charges can set a price for carbon, but cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions. Literature identifies taxes as an efficient way of internalizing costs of GHG emissions. o Tradable permits will establish a carbon price. The volume of allowed emissions determines their environmental effectiveness, while the allocation of permits has distributional consequences. Fluctuation in the price of carbon makes it difficult to estimate the total cost of complying with emission permits. o Financial incentives (subsidies and tax credits) are frequently used by governments to stimulate the development and diffusion of new technologies. While economic costs are generally higher than for the instruments listed above, they are often critical to overcome barriers. o Voluntary agreements between industry and governments are politically attractive, raise awareness among stakeholders, and have played a role in the evolution of many national policies. The majority of agreements has not achieved significant emissions reductions beyond business as usual. However, some recent agreements, in a few countries, have accelerated the application of best available technology and led to measurable emission reductions.  o Information instruments (e.g. awareness campaigns) may positively affect environmental quality by promoting informed choices and possibly contributing to behavioural change, however, their impact on emissions has not been measured yet. o RD&D can stimulate technological advances, reduce costs, and enable progress toward stabilization. - Some corporations, local and regional authorities, NGOs and civil groups are adopting a wide variety of voluntary actions. These voluntary actions may limit GHG emissions, stimulate innovative policies, and encourage the deployment of new technologies. On their own, they generally have limited impact on the national or regional level emissions [13.4]. - Lessons learned from specific sector application of national policies and instruments are shown in Table SPM.7. 23. Policies that provide a real or implicit price of carbon could create incentives for producers and consumers to significantly invest in low-GHG products, technologies and processes. Such policies could include economic instruments, government funding and regulation (high agreement, much evidence). - An effective carbon-price signal could realize significant mitigation potential in all sectors [11.3, 13.2]. - Modelling studies, consistent with stabilization at around 550 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 (see Box SPM.3), show carbon prices rising to 20 to 80 US$/tCO2-eq by 2030 and 30 to 155 US$/tCO2-eq by 2050. For the same stabilization level, studies since TAR that take into account induced technological change lower these price ranges to 5 to 65 US$/tCO2-eq in 2030 and 15 to 130 US$/tCO2-eq in 2050 [3.3, 11.4, 11.5]. - Most top-down, as well as some 2050 bottom-up assessments, suggest that real or implicit carbon prices of 20 to 50 US$/tCO2-eq, sustained or increased over decades, could lead to a power generation sector with low-GHG emissions by 2050 and make many mitigation options in the end-use sectors economically attractive. [4.4,11.6] - Barriers to the implementation of mitigation options are manifold and vary by country and sector. They can be related to financial, technological, institutional, informational and behavioural aspects [4.5, 5.5, 6.7, 7.6, 8.6, 9.6, 10.5].  Table SPM.7: Selected sectoral policies, measures and instruments that have shown to be environmentally effective in the respective sector in at least a number of national cases.  24. Government support through financial contributions, tax credits, standard setting and market creation is important for effective technology development, innovation and deployment. Transfer of technology to developing countries depends on enabling conditions and financing (high agreement, much evidence). - Public benefits of RD&D investments are bigger than  the benefits captured by the private sector, justifying government support of RD&D. - Government funding in real absolute terms for most energy research programmes has been flat or declining for nearly two decades (even after the UNFCCC came into force) and is now about half of the 1980 level [2.7, 3.4, 4.5, 11.5, 13.2].    - Governments have a crucial supportive role in providing appropriate enabling environment, such as, institutional, policy, legal and regulatory frameworks31, to sustain investment flows and for effective technology transfer - without which it may be difficult to achieve emission reductions at a significant scale. Mobilizing financing of incremental costs of low-carbon technologies is important. International technology agreements could strengthen the knowledge infrastructure [13.3]. - The potential beneficial effect of technology transfer to developing countries brought about by Annex I countries action may be substantial, but no reliable estimates are available [11.7]. - Financial flows to developing countries through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects have the potential to reach levels of the order of several billions US$ per year32, which is higher than the flows through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), comparable to the energy oriented development assistance flows, but at least an order of magnitude lower than total foreign direct investment flows. The financial flows through CDM, GEF and development assistance for technology transfer have so far been limited and geographically unequally distributed [12.3, 13.3]. 25. Notable achievements of the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol are the establishment of a global response to the climate problem, stimulation of an array of national policies, the creation of an international carbon market and the establishment of new institutional mechanisms that may provide the foundation for future mitigation efforts (high agreement, much evidence). - The impact of the Protocol's first commitment period relative to global emissions is projected to be limited. Its economic impacts on participating Annex-B countries are projected to be smaller than presented in TAR, that showed 0.2-2% lower GDP in 2012 without emissions trading, and 0.1-1.1% lower GDP with emissions trading among Annex-B countries [1.4, 11.4, 13.3]. 26. The literature identifies many options for achieving reductions of global GHG emissions at the international level through cooperation. It also suggests that successful agreements are environmentally effective, cost-effective, incorporate distributional considerations and equity, and are institutionally feasible (high agreement, much evidence). - Greater cooperative efforts to reduce emissions will help to reduce global costs for achieving a given level of mitigation, or will improve environmental effectiveness [13.3]. - Improving, and expanding the scope of, market mechanisms (such as emission trading, Joint  Implementation and CDM) could reduce overall mitigation costs [13.3]. - Efforts to address climate change can include diverse elements such as emissions targets; sectoral, local, subnational and regional actions; RD&D programmes; adopting common policies; implementing development oriented actions; or expanding financing instruments. These elements can be implemented in an integrated fashion, but comparing the efforts made by different countries quantitatively would be complex and resource intensive [13.3]. - Actions that could be taken by participating countries can be differentiated both in terms of when such action is undertaken, who participates and what the action will be. Actions can be binding or non-binding, include fixed or dynamic targets, and participation can be static or vary over time [13.3]. F. Sustainable development and climate change mitigation 27. Making development more sustainable by changing development paths can make a major contribution to climate change mitigation, but implementation may require resources to overcome multiple barriers. There is a growing understanding of the possibilities to choose and implement mitigation options in several sectors to realize synergies and avoid conflicts with other dimensions of sustainable development (high agreement, much evidence). - Irrespective of the scale of mitigation measures, adaptation measures are necessary [1.2]. - Addressing climate change can be considered an integral element of sustainable development policies. National circumstances and the strengths of institutions determine how development policies impact GHG emissions. Changes in development paths emerge from the interactions of public and private decision processes involving government, business and civil society, many of which are not traditionally considered as climate policy. This process is most effective when actors participate equitably and decentralized decision making processes are coordinated [2.2, 3.3, 12.2]. - Climate change and other sustainable development policies are often but not always synergistic. There is growing evidence that decisions about macroeconomic policy, agricultural policy, multilateral development bank lending, insurance practices, electricity market reform, energy security and forest conservation, for example, which are often treated as being apart from climate policy, can significantly reduce emissions. On the other hand, decisions about improving rural access to modern energy sources for example may not have much influence on global GHG emissions [12.2]. - Climate change policies related to energy efficiency and renewable energy are often economically beneficial, improve energy security and reduce local pollutant emissions. Other energy supply mitigation options can be designed to also achieve sustainable development benefits such as avoided displacement of local populations, job creation, and health benefits [4.5,12.3]. - Reducing both loss of natural habitat and deforestation can have significant biodiversity, soil and water conservation benefits, and can be implemented in a socially and economically sustainable manner. Forestation and bioenergy plantations can lead to restoration of degraded land, manage water runoff, retain soil carbon and benefit rural economies, but could compete with land for food production and may be negative for biodiversity, if not properly designed [9.7, 12.3]. - There are also good possibilities for reinforcing sustainable development through mitigation actions in the waste management, transportation and buildings sectors [5.4, 6.6, 10.5, 12.3]. - Making development more sustainable can enhance both mitigative and adaptive capacity, and reduce emissions and vulnerability to climate change. Synergies between mitigation and adaptation can exist, for example properly designed biomass production, formation of protected areas, land management, energy use in buildings and forestry. In other situations, there may be trade-offs, such as increased GHG emissions due to increased consumption of energy related to adaptive responses [2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6.9, 7.8, 8.5, 9.5, 11.9, 12.1].  G. Gaps in knowledge 28. There are still relevant gaps in currently available knowledge regarding some aspects of mitigation of climate change, especially in developing countries. Additional research addressing those gaps would further reduce uncertainties and thus facilitate decision-making related to mitigation of climate change [TS.14]. Endbox 1: Uncertainty representation Uncertainty is an inherent feature of any assessment. The fourth assessment report clarifies the uncertainties associated with essential statements. Fundamental differences between the underlying disciplinary sciences of the three Working Group reports make a common approach impractical. The ""likelihood"" approach applied in ""Climate change 2007, the physical science basis"" and the ""confidence"" and ""likelihood"" approaches used in ""Climate change 2007, impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability"" were judged to be inadequate to deal with the specific uncertainties involved in this mitigation report, as here human choices are considered. In this report a two-dimensional scale is used for the treatment of uncertainty. The scale is based on the expert judgment of the authors of WGIII on the level of concurrence in the literature on a particular finding (level of agreement), and the number and quality of independent sources qualifying under the IPCC rules upon which the finding is based (amount of evidence) (see Table SPM.E.1). This is not a quantitative approach, from which probabilities relating to uncertainty can be derived. Table SPM.E.1: Qualitative definition of uncertainty  "
IPCC-2014-8.txt,"Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report CSuhmapmtearry for Policymakers     1. Observed Changes and their Causes Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems. {1}   1.1 Observed changes in the climate system Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen. {1.1} Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible (medium confidence). The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] -C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist (Figure .1a). {1.1.1, Figure 1.1} In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability (Figure .1a). Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over  the past 15 years (1998-2012; 0.05 [-0.05 to 0.15] -C per decade), which begins with a strong El Ni-o, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 (1951-2012; 0.12 [0.08 to 0.14] -C per decade). {1.1.1, Box 1.1}  Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy  accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence), with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale,  the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] -C per decade over the    period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0-700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed  between the 1870s and 1971. {1.1.2, Figure 1.2}  Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 (medium confidence before and high confidence after 1951). For other latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low confidence. Observations of changes in ocean surface salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the global water cycle over the ocean (medium confidence). It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s. {1.1.1, 1.1.2}  Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 (high confidence), corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. {1.1.2}  Over the period 1992 to 2011, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass (high confidence), likely at a larger rate over 2002 to 2011. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide (high confidence). Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent (high confidence). There is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow cover. {1.1.3}  The annual mean Arctic sea-ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012, with a rate that was very likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer (high confidence). It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea-ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. {1.1.3, Figure 1.1}  Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m (Figure .1b). The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). {1.1.4, Figure 1.1}   1.2 Causes of climate change Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth, and are now higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate system and are extremely likely to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. {1.2, 1.3.1} Anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Figure .1c). Between 1750 and 2011, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were 2040 - 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have remained in the atmosphere (880 - 35 GtCO2); the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land (in plants and soils) and in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification. About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years (high confidence) (Figure .1d). {1.2.1, 1.2.2}  Figure .2 | Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to 2010 by gases: CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes; CO2 from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); fluorinated gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (F-gases). Right hand side shows 2010 emissions, using alternatively CO2-equivalent emission weightings based on IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR) and AR5 values. Unless otherwise stated, CO2-equivalent emissions in this report include the basket of Kyoto gases (CO2, CH4, N2O as well as F-gases) calculated based on 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values from the SAR (see Glossary). Using the most recent GWP100 values from the AR5 (right-hand bars) would result in higher total annual GHG emissions (52 GtCO2-eq/yr) from an increased contribution of methane, but does not change the long-term trend significantly. {Figure 1.6, Box 3.2}    Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 have reached 49 - 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the period 2000 to 2010 (high confidence) (Figure .2). Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of energy) of the world's energy supply (high confidence). {1.2.2} The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It is extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period (Figure .3). Anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica4. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content (0-700 m) and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s. {1.3, Figure 1.10}  Figure .3 | Assessed likely ranges (whiskers) and their mid-points (bars) for warming trends over the 1951-2010 period from well-mixed greenhouse gases, other anthropogenic forcings (including the cooling effect of aerosols and the effect of land use change), combined anthropogenic forcings, natural forcings and natural internal climate variability (which is the element of climate variability that arises spontaneously within the climate system even in the absence of forcings). The observed surface temperature change is shown in black, with the 5 to 95% uncertainty range due to observational uncertainty. The attributed warming ranges (colours) are based on observations combined with climate model simulations, in order to estimate the contribution of an individual external forcing to the observed warming. The contribution from the combined anthropogenic forcings can be estimated with less uncertainty than the contributions from greenhouse gases and from other anthropogenic forcings separately. This is because these two contributions partially compensate, resulting in a combined signal that is better constrained by observations. {Figure 1.9}   1.3 Impacts of climate change  In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. {1.3.2}  Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality (medium confidence). Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change (high confidence). Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences (Figure .4). Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts (high confidence). Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to human influence (medium confidence). {1.3.2}  Figure .4 | Based on the available scientific literature since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), there are substantially more impacts in recent decades now attributed to climate change. Attribution requires defined scientific evidence on the role of climate change. Absence from the map of additional impacts attributed to climate change does not imply that such impacts have not occurred. The publications supporting attributed impacts reflect a growing knowledge base, but publications are still limited for many regions, systems and processes, highlighting gaps in data and studies. Symbols indicate categories of attributed impacts, the relative contribution of climate change (major or minor) to the observed impact and confidence in attribution. Each symbol refers to one or more entries in WGII Table .A1, grouping related regional-scale impacts. Numbers in ovals indicate regional totals of climate change publications from 2001 to 2010, based on the Scopus bibliographic database for publications in English with individual countries mentioned in title, abstract or key words (as of July 2011). These numbers provide an overall measure of the available scientific literature on climate change across regions; they do not indicate the number of publications supporting attribution of climate change impacts in each region. Studies for polar regions and small islands are grouped with neighbouring continental regions. The inclusion of publications for assessment of attribution followed IPCC scientific evidence criteria defined in WGII Chapter 18. Publications considered in the attribution analyses come from a broader range of literature assessed in the WGII AR5. See WGII Table .A1 for descriptions of the attributed impacts. {Figure 1.11}   1.4 Extreme events Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. {1.4} It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions. {1.4}  There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased.    Recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of  flooding at regional scale (medium confidence). It is likely that extreme sea levels (for example, as experienced in storm  surges) have increased since 1970, being mainly a result of rising mean sea level. {1.4}  Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability (very high confidence). {1.4}   2. Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks. {2}   2.1 Key drivers of future climate Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary over a wide range, depending on both socio-economic development and climate policy. {2.1} Anthropogenic GHG emissions are mainly driven by population size, economic activity, lifestyle, energy use, land use patterns, technology and climate policy. The Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used for making projections based on these factors, describe four different 21st century pathways of GHG emissions and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs include a stringent mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), two intermediate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0) and one scenario with very high GHG emissions (RCP8.5). Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain emissions ('baseline scenarios') lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (Figure .5a). RCP2.6 is representative of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely below 2-C above pre-industrial temperatures. The RCPs are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the literature as assessed by WGIII5. {2.1, Box 2.2, 4.3} Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong, consistent, almost linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and projected global temperature change to the year 2100 in both the RCPs and the wider set of mitigation scenarios analysed in WGIII (Figure .5b). Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions6, and therefore, e.g., higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later. {2.2.5, Table 2.2}   Figure .5 | (a) Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) alone in the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (lines) and the associated scenario categories used in WGIII (coloured areas show 5 to 95% range). The WGIII scenario categories summarize the wide range of emission scenarios published in the scientific literature and are defined on the basis of CO2-eq concentration levels (in ppm) in 2100. The time series of other greenhouse gas emissions are shown in Box 2.2, Figure 1. (b) Global mean surface temperature increase at the time global CO2 emissions reach a given net cumulative total, plotted as a function of that total, from various lines of evidence. Coloured plume shows the spread of past and future projections from a hierarchy of climate-carbon cycle models driven by historical emissions and the four RCPs over all times out to 2100, and fades with the decreasing number of available models. Ellipses show total anthropogenic warming in 2100 versus cumulative CO2 emissions from 1870 to 2100 from a simple climate model (median climate response) under the scenario categories used in WGIII. The width of the ellipses in terms of temperature is caused by the impact of different scenarios for non-CO2 climate drivers. The filled black ellipse shows observed emissions to 2005 and observed temperatures in the decade 2000-2009 with associated uncertainties. {Box 2.2, Figure 1; Figure 2.3}  Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2-C relative to the period 1861-1880 with a probability of >66%7 would require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to remain below about 2900 GtCO2 (with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 depending on non-CO2 drivers). About 1900 GtCO28 had already been emitted by 2011. For additional context see Table 2.2. {2.2.5}   2.2 Projected changes in the climate system Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission scenarios. It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions. The ocean will continue to warm and acidify, and global mean sea level to rise. {2.2} The projected changes in Section  2.2 are for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005, unless otherwise indicated. Future climate will depend on committed warming caused by past anthropogenic emissions, as well as future anthropogenic emissions and natural climate variability. The global mean surface temperature change for the period 2016-2035 relative to 1986-2005 is similar for the four RCPs and will likely be in the range 0.3-C to 0.7-C (medium confidence). This assumes that there will be no major volcanic eruptions or changes in some natural sources (e.g., CH4 and N2O), or unexpected changes in total solar irradiance. By mid-21st century, the magnitude of the projected climate change is substantially affected by the choice of emissions scenario. {2.2.1, Table 2.1} Relative to 1850-1900, global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) is projected to likely exceed 1.5-C for RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence). Warming is likely to exceed 2-C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 (high confidence), more likely than not to exceed 2-C for RCP4.5 (medium confidence), but unlikely to exceed 2-C for RCP2.6 (medium confidence). {2.2.1} The increase of global mean surface temperature by the end of the 21st century (2081-2100) relative to 1986-2005 is likely to be 0.3-C to 1.7-C under RCP2.6, 1.1-C to 2.6-C under RCP4.5, 1.4-C to 3.1-C under RCP6.0 and 2.6-C to 4.8-C under RCP8.59. The Arctic region will continue to warm more rapidly than the global mean (Figure .6a, Figure .7a). {2.2.1, Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2, Table 2.1} It is virtually certain that there will be more frequent hot and fewer cold temperature extremes over most land areas on daily and seasonal timescales, as global mean surface temperature increases. It is very likely that heat waves will occur with a higher frequency and longer duration. Occasional cold winter extremes will continue to occur. {2.2.1} Year  Figure .6 | Global average surface temperature change (a) and global mean sea level rise10 (b) from 2006 to 2100 as determined by multi-model simulations. All changes are relative to 1986-2005. Time series of projections and a measure of uncertainty (shading) are shown for scenarios RCP2.6 (blue) and RCP8.5 (red). The mean and associated uncertainties averaged over 2081-2100 are given for all RCP scenarios as coloured vertical bars at the right hand side of each panel. The number of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated. {2.2, Figure 2.1}  Changes in precipitation will not be uniform. The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation under the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario (Figure .7b). Extreme precipitation events over most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense and more frequent. {2.2.2, Figure 2.2} The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century, with the strongest warming projected for the surface in tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions (Figure .7a). {2.2.3, Figure 2.2}  Figure .7 | Change in average surface temperature (a) and change in average precipitation (b) based on multi-model mean projections for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 under the RCP2.6 (left) and RCP8.5 (right) scenarios. The number of models used to calculate the multi-model mean is indicated in the upper right corner of each panel. Stippling (i.e., dots) shows regions where the projected change is large compared to natural internal variability and where at least 90% of models agree on the sign of change. Hatching (i.e., diagonal lines) shows regions where the projected change is less than one standard deviation of the natural internal variability. {2.2, Figure 2.2}  Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07 (15 to 17% increase in acidity) for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 (38 to 41%) for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 (58 to 62%) for RCP6.0 and 0.30 to 0.32 (100 to 109%) for RCP8.5. {2.2.4, Figure 2.1} Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. A nearly ice-free11 Arctic Ocean in the summer sea-ice minimum in September before mid-century is likely for RCP8.512 (medium confidence). {2.2.3, Figure 2.1} It is virtually certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases, with the area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) projected to decrease by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the multi-model average (medium confidence). {2.2.3} The global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica (and excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets), is projected to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {2.2.3}  11 When sea-ice extent is less than one million km2 for at least five consecutive years. 12 Based on an assessment of the subset of models that most closely reproduce the climatological mean state and 1979-2012 trend of the Arctic sea-ice extent.   Summary for Policymakers There has been significant improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Global mean sea level rise will continue during the 21st century, very likely at a faster rate than observed from 1971 to 2010. For the period 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005, the rise will likely be in the ranges of 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, and of 0.45 to 0.82 m for RCP8.5 (medium confidence)10 (Figure .6b). Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience a sea level change within -20% of the global mean. {2.2.3}   2.3 Future risks and impacts caused by a changing climate Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. {2.3} Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related hazards (including hazardous events and trends) with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Some risks are particularly relevant for individual regions (Figure .8), while others are global. The overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds increases with rising temperature (medium confidence). For risk assessment, it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. {1.5, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, Box Introduction.1, Box 2.3, Box 2.4} A large fraction of species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with other stressors (high confidence). Most plant species cannot naturally shift their geographical ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes; most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above in flat landscapes in this century (high confidence). Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high rates and magnitudes of ocean acidification (high confidence), with associated risks exacerbated by rising ocean temperature extremes (medium confidence). Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at risk from sea level rise, which will continue for centuries even if the global mean temperature is stabilized (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, Figure 2.5} Climate change is projected to undermine food security (Figure .9). Due to projected climate change by the mid-21st century and beyond, global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services (high confidence). For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of 2-C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may benefit (medium confidence). Global temperature increases of ~4-C or more13 above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security globally (high confidence). Climate change is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions (robust evidence, high agreement), intensifying competition for water among sectors (limited evidence, medium agreement). {2.3.1, 2.3.2}   Figure .8 | Representative key risks14 for each region, including the potential for risk reduction through adaptation and mitigation, as well as limits to adaptation. Each key risk is assessed as very low, low, medium, high or very high. Risk levels are presented for three time frames: present, near term (here, for 2030-2040) and long term (here, for 2080-2100). In the near term, projected levels of global mean temperature increase do not diverge substantially across different emission scenarios. For the long term, risk levels are presented for two possible futures (2-C and 4-C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels). For each timeframe, risk levels are indicated for a continuation of current adaptation and assuming high levels of current or future adaptation. Risk levels are not necessarily comparable, especially across regions. {Figure 2.4} Figure .9 | (a) Projected global redistribution of maximum catch potential of ~1000 exploited marine fish and invertebrate species. Projections compare the 10-year averages 2001-2010 and 2051-2060 using ocean conditions based on a single climate model under a moderate to high warming scenario, without analysis of potential impacts of overfishing or ocean acidification. (b) Summary of projected changes in crop yields (mostly wheat, maize, rice and soy), due to climate change over the 21st century. Data for each timeframe sum to 100%, indicating the percentage of projections showing yield increases versus decreases. The figure includes projections (based on 1090 data points) for different emission scenarios, for tropical and temperate regions and for adaptation and no-adaptation cases combined. Changes in crop yields are relative to late 20th century levels. {Figure 2.6a, Figure 2.7}  Until mid-century, projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health problems that already exist (very high confidence). Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change (high confidence). By 2100 for RCP8.5, the combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and working outdoors (high confidence). {2.3.2} In urban areas climate change is projected to increase risks for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress, storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges (very high confidence). These risks are amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living in exposed areas. {2.3.2}    Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world (high confidence). {2.3.2}  Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature (limited evidence, high agreement), but global economic  impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. From a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are    projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and prolong  existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger (medium confidence). International dimensions such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of  climate change at regional scales. {2.3.2}  Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people (medium evidence, high agreement). Populations that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme weather events, particularly in developing countries with low income. Climate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks (medium confidence). {2.3.2}   2.4 Climate change beyond 2100, irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of climate change and associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. {2.4} Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period. {2.4, Figure 2.8} Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting biomes, soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales which will result in changes lasting hundreds to thousands of years after global surface temperature is stabilized. {2.1, 2.4} There is high confidence that ocean acidification will increase for centuries if CO2 emissions continue, and will strongly affect marine ecosystems. {2.4} It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The threshold for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more, and an associated sea level rise of up to 7 m, is greater than about 1-C (low confidence) but less than about 4-C (medium confidence) of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible, but current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment. {2.4} Magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios pose an increased risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands (medium confidence). A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain with continued rise in global temperatures. {2.4}    3. Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development  Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks  of climate change. Substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades can reduce cli-  mate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce  the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term and contribute to climate-resilient    pathways for sustainable development. {3.2, 3.3, 3.4}   3.1 Foundations of decision-making about climate change Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. {3.1}  Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries' past and future contributions to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Comprehensive strategies in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development take into account the co-benefits, adverse side effects and risks that may arise from both adaptation and mitigation options. {3.1, 3.5, Box 3.4} The design of climate policy is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties and take them into account. Methods of valuation from economic, social and ethical analysis are available to assist decision-making. These methods can take account of a wide range of possible impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. But they cannot identify a single best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. {3.1} Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent (e.g., individual, community, company, country) affect other agents. Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation. {3.1}  3.2 Climate change risks reduced by mitigation and adaptation Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally (high confidence). Mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change, increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. {3.2, 3.4} Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts over different timescales (high confidence). Mitigation, in the near term and through the century, can substantially reduce climate change  impacts in the latter decades of the 21st century and beyond. Benefits from adaptation can already be realized in addressing current risks, and can be realized in the future for addressing emerging risks. {3.2, 4.5}  Five Reasons For Concern (RFCs) aggregate climate change risks and illustrate the implications of warming and of adaptation  limits for people, economies and ecosystems across sectors and regions. The five RFCs are associated with: (1) Unique and  threatened systems, (2) Extreme weather events, (3) Distribution of impacts, (4) Global aggregate impacts, and (5) Large-    scale singular events. In this report, the RFCs provide information relevant to Article 2 of UNFCCC. {Box 2.4}  Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally (high confidence) (Figure .10). In most scenarios without additional mitigation efforts (those with 2100 atmospheric concentrations   >1000 ppm CO2-eq), warming is more likely than not to exceed 4-C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 (Table .1). The risks associated with temperatures at or above 4-C include substantial species extinction, global and regional food insecurity, consequential constraints on common human activities and limited potential for adaptation in some cases (high confidence). Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1-C to 2-C above pre-industrial levels. {2.3, Figure 2.5, 3.2, 3.4, Box 2.4, Table .1}  Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting    warming in the second half of the 21st century and beyond. Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Limiting risks across RFCs would imply a limit for cumulative emissions  of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to zero and would constrain annual emissions over the next few decades (Figure .10) (high confidence). But some risks from climate damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation. {2.2.5, 3.2, 3.4}  Mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from climate change. Inertia in the economic and climate system and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts (high confidence). Delays in additional mitigation or constraints on technological options increase the longer-term mitigation costs to hold climate change risks at a given level (Table .2). {3.2, 3.4}   3.3 Characteristics of adaptation pathways Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. {3.3}  Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific (high confidence). A first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate variability (high confidence). Integration of adaptation into planning, including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction. Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options (robust evidence, high agreement). {3.3} Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments (high confidence). National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support (robust evidence, high agreement). Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing (medium evidence, high agreement). {3.3} Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal values, objectives and risk perceptions (high confidence). Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous peoples' holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge with existing practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation. {3.3} Constraints can interact to impede adaptation planning and implementation (high confidence). Common constraints on implementation arise from the following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Another constraint includes insufficient research, monitoring, and observation and the finance to maintain them. {3.3} Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits (high confidence). Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Further, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors (medium evidence, high agreement). Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes. {3.3}  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across regions (very high confidence). Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include (i) improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; (ii) reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; (iii) sustainable agriculture and forestry; and (iv) protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem services. {3.3} Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development (high confidence). At the national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country's own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance with its national circumstances and priorities. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes to existing systems and structures, without considering transformational change, may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned paradigms and may place new and increased demands on governance structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible equity and ethical implications. Adaptation pathways are enhanced by iterative learning, deliberative processes and innovation. {3.3}  3.4 Characteristics of mitigation pathways There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely to limit warming to below 2-C relative to pre-industrial levels. These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological, economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. {3.4} Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global emissions growth is expected to persist, driven by growth in global population and economic activities. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 in baseline scenarios--those without additional mitigation--range from 3.7-C to 4.8-C above the average for 1850-1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5-C to 7.8-C when including climate uncertainty (5th to 95th percentile range) (high confidence). {3.4}Emissions scenarios leading to CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming below 2-C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels15. These scenarios are characterized by 40 to 70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 201016, and emissions levels near zero or below in 2100. Mitigation scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not to limit temperature change to less than 2-C, unless they temporarily overshoot concentration levels of roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq  before 2100, in which case they are about as likely as not to achieve that goal. In these 500 ppm CO2-eq scenarios, global 2050 emissions levels are 25 to 55% lower than in 2010. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater  reliance on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies beyond mid-century (and vice versa). Trajectories that are likely to  limit warming to 3-C relative to pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming to 2-C. A limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely than not to limit warming to 1.5-C by 2100; these scenarios are  characterized by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between 70% and 95% below  2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and    their likelihood to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Figure .11 and Table .1. {3.4}  Figure .11 | Global greenhouse gas emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) in baseline and mitigation scenarios for different long-term concentration levels (a) and associated upscaling requirements of low-carbon energy (% of primary energy) for 2030, 2050 and 2100 compared to 2010 levels in mitigation scenarios (b). {Figure 3.2}     Figure .12 | The implications of different 2030 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels for the rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions and low-carbon energy upscaling in mitigation scenarios that are at least about as likely as not to keep warming throughout the 21st century below 2-C relative to pre-industrial levels (2100 CO2-equivalent concentrations of 430 to 530 ppm). The scenarios are grouped according to different emissions levels by 2030 (coloured in different shades of green). The left panel shows the pathways of GHG emissions (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/ yr) leading to these 2030 levels. The black dot with whiskers gives historic GHG emission levels and associated uncertainties in 2010 as reported in Figure .2. The black bar shows the estimated uncertainty range of GHG emissions implied by the Canc-n Pledges. The middle panel denotes the average annual CO2 emissions reduction rates for the period 2030-2050. It compares the median and interquartile range across scenarios from recent inter-model comparisons with explicit 2030 interim goals to the range of scenarios in the Scenario Database for WGIII AR5. Annual rates of historical emissions change (sustained over a period of 20 years) and the average annual CO2 emission change between 2000 and 2010 are shown as well. The arrows in the right panel show the magnitude of zero and low-carbon energy supply upscaling from 2030 to 2050 subject to different 2030 GHG emissions levels. Zero- and low-carbon energy supply includes renewables, nuclear energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). [Note: Only scenarios that apply the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with large net negative global emissions (>20 GtCO2-eq/yr), scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions and scenarios with 2010 emissions significantly outside the historical range are excluded.] {Figure 3.3}  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (consistent with a likely chance to keep warming below 2-C relative to pre-industrial levels) typically involve temporary overshoot17 of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq in 2100 (Table .1). Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability and scale of these and other CDR technologies and methods are uncertain and CDR technologies are, to varying degrees, associated with challenges and risks18. CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is more expensive (high confidence). {3.4, Box 3.3} Reducing emissions of non-CO2 agents can be an important element of mitigation strategies. All current GHG emissions and other forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades, although long-term warming is mainly driven by CO2 emissions. Emissions of non-CO2 forcers are often expressed as `CO2-equivalent emissions', but the choice of metric to calculate these emissions, and the implications for the emphasis and timing of abatement of the various climate forcers, depends on application and policy context and contains value judgments. {3.4, Box 3.2} 17 In concentration `overshoot' scenarios, concentrations peak during the century and then decline. 18 CDR methods have biogeochemical and technological limitations to their potential on the global scale. There is insufficient knowledge to quantify how much CO2 emissions could be partially offset by CDR on a century timescale. CDR methods may carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale.   Figure .13 | Global mitigation costs in cost-effective scenarios at different atmospheric concentrations levels in 2100. Cost-effective scenarios assume immediate mitigation in all countries and a single global carbon price, and impose no additional limitations on technology relative to the models' default technology assumptions. Consumption losses are shown relative to a baseline development without climate policy (left panel). The table at the top shows percentage points of annualized consumption growth reductions relative to consumption growth in the baseline of 1.6 to 3% per year (e.g., if the reduction is 0.06 percentage points per year due to mitigation, and baseline growth is 2.0% per year, then the growth rate with mitigation would be 1.94% per year). Cost estimates shown in this table do not consider the benefits of reduced climate change or co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation. Estimates at the high end of these cost ranges are from models that are relatively inflexible to achieve the deep emissions reductions required in the long run to meet these goals and/or include assumptions about market imperfections that would raise costs. {Figure 3.4}  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century to below 2-C relative to pre-industrial levels. It will require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions from 2030 to 2050; a much more rapid scale-up of low-carbon energy over this period; a larger reliance on CDR in the long term; and higher transitional and long-term economic impacts. Estimated global emissions levels in 2020 based on the Canc-n Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective mitigation trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below 2-C relative to pre-industrial levels, but they do not preclude the option to meet this goal (high confidence) (Figure .12, Table .2). {3.4} Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions, but increase with the stringency of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for estimating macro-economic mitigation costs (Figure .13). Under these assumptions mitigation scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2-C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption--not including benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation--of 1 to 4% (median: 1.7%) in 2030, 2 to 6% (median: 3.4%) in 2050 and 3 to 11% (median: 4.8%) in 2100 relative to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century (Figure .13). These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 (median: 0.06) percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6 and 3% per year (high confidence). {3.4} In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies (such as bioenergy, CCS and their combination BECCS, nuclear, wind/solar), mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered. Delaying additional mitigation increases mitigation costs in the medium to long term. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2-C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels if additional mitigation is considerably delayed. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2-C if bioenergy, CCS and their combination (BECCS) are limited (high confidence) (Table .2). {3.4}  Table .2 | Increase in global mitigation costs due to either limited availability of specific technologies or delays in additional mitigation a relative to cost-effective scenarios b. The increase in costs is given for the median estimate and the 16th to 84th percentile range of the scenarios (in parentheses) c. In addition, the sample size of each scenario set is provided in the coloured symbols. The colours of the symbols indicate the fraction of models from systematic model comparison exercises that could successfully reach the targeted concentration level. {Table 3.2}  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system. {4.4.2.2} Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions and fuels exist (high confidence). Most mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters (high confidence). The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effects of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets (medium confidence). {4.4.2.2} Solar Radiation Management (SRM) involves large-scale methods that seek to reduce the amount of absorbed solar energy in the climate system. SRM is untested and is not included in any of the mitigation scenarios. If it were deployed, SRM would entail numerous uncertainties, side effects, risks and shortcomings and has particular governance and ethical implications. SRM would not reduce ocean acidification. If it were terminated, there is high confidence that surface temperatures would rise very rapidly impacting ecosystems susceptible to rapid rates of change. {Box 3.3}     4. Adaptation and Mitigation  Many adaptation and mitigation options can help address climate change, but no single option is sufficient by itself. Effective implementation depends on policies and cooperation at all scales and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link adaptation and mitigation with other societal objectives. {4}   4.1 Common enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors. These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. {4.1}  Inertia in many aspects of the socio-economic system constrains adaptation and mitigation options (medium evidence, high agreement). Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce GHG emissions and enhance resilience to climate change (very high confidence). {4.1} Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture (medium evidence, medium agreement). Also, the social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. {4.1} For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing climate change risks (high confidence). Improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction (very high confidence). {4.1}  4.2 Response options for adaptation Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options. {4.2}  Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sectors and within communities. There is increasing recognition of the value of social (including local and indigenous), institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of responses (high confidence). {1.6, 4.2, 4.4.2.1} The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change (very high confidence). Adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on their context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning (Table .3). Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans. {4.2} Table .3 | Approaches for managing the risks of climate change through adaptation. These approaches should be considered overlapping rather than discrete, and they are often pursued simultaneously. Examples are presented in no specific order and can be relevant to more than one category. {Table 4.2}    4.3 Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective  if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the green-  house gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and    enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors. {4.3}  Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others (medium confidence). Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. {4.3} Emissions ranges for baseline scenarios and mitigation scenarios that limit CO2-equivalent concentrations to low levels (about 450 ppm CO2-eq, likely to limit warming to 2-C above pre-industrial levels) are shown for different sectors and gases in Figure .14. Key measures to achieve such mitigation goals include decarbonizing (i.e., reducing the carbon intensity of) electricity generation (medium evidence, high agreement) as well as efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development (robust evidence, high agreement). In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios (about 450 to about 500 ppm CO2-eq, at least about as likely as not to limit warming to 2-C above pre-industrial levels), the share of low-carbon electricity supply (comprising renewable energy (RE), nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) including bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS)) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100. {4.3}   Figure .14 | Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by sector and total non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Kyoto gases) across sectors in baseline (faded bars) and mitigation scenarios (solid colour bars) that reach about 450 (430 to 480) ppm CO2-eq concentrations in 2100 (likely to limit warming to 2-C above preindustrial levels). Mitigation in the end-use sectors leads also to indirect emissions reductions in the upstream energy supply sector. Direct emissions of the end-use sectors thus do not include the emission reduction potential at the supply-side due to, for example, reduced electricity demand. The numbers at the bottom of the graphs refer to the number of scenarios included in the range (upper row: baseline scenarios; lower row: mitigation scenarios), which differs across sectors and time due to different sectoral resolution and time horizon of models. Emissions ranges for mitigation scenarios include the full portfolio of mitigation options; many models cannot reach 450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 2100 in the absence of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Negative emissions in the electricity sector are due to the application of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS). `Net' agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions consider afforestation, reforestation as well as deforestation activities. {4.3, Figure 4.1}  Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits. The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions; and in agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.3, Figures 4.1, 4.2, Table 4.3}  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change (medium evidence, medium agreement). Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes. {4.1, 4.3}  4.4 Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance Effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales: international, regional, national and sub-national. Policies across all scales supporting technology development, diffusion and transfer, as well as finance for responses to climate change, can complement and enhance the effectiveness of policies that directly promote adaptation and mitigation. {4.4} International cooperation is critical for effective mitigation, even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Adaptation focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation: {3.1, 4.4.1} - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the main multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation. {4.4.1} - The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms and environmental effectiveness (medium evidence, low agreement). {4.4.1} - Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation benefits (medium evidence, medium agreement). Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity. {4.4.1} - International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has received less attention historically than mitigation but is increasing and has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at the national, sub-national and local level (high confidence). {4.4.1} There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-national plans and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation since the AR4, with an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects (high confidence): {4.4.2.1, 4.4.2.2} - National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation (robust evidence, high agreement) through coordinating actions and providing frameworks and support. While local government and the private sector have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.4.2.1} - Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into planning and decision-making, play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation (robust evidence,  high agreement). Examples of institutional approaches to adaptation involving multiple actors include economic options (e.g., insurance, public-private partnerships), laws and regulations (e.g., land-zoning laws) and national and government policies and programmes (e.g., economic diversification). {4.2, 4.4.2.1, Table .3}  - In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as    well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps  that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). In some countries, tax-based policies  specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions--alongside technology and other policies--have helped to weaken the  link between GHG emissions and GDP (high confidence). In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes (although  not necessarily designed for the purpose of mitigation) have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes. {4.4.2.2}  - Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective (medium evidence, medium agreement). Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions. {4.4.2.2}  - Sector-specific mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies (medium evidence, high agreement). Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address sector-specific barriers or market failures and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies. Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. {4.4.2.2}  - Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable energy (RE) policies including subsidies--motivated by many factors--have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. At the same time, reducing subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context (high confidence). {4.4.2.2}  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development. The potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweighs the potential for adverse side effects whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations (low confidence). These potential adverse side effects on energy access can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms (medium confidence). Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified. {4.3, 4.4.2.2, Box 3.4}  Technology policy (development, diffusion and transfer) complements other mitigation policies across all scales, from international to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices (high confidence). Policies exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies can also depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances. {4.4.3}  Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns (high confidence). For mitigation scenarios that stabilize concentrations (without overshoot) in the range of 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 210019, annual investments in low carbon electricity supply and energy efficiency in key sectors (transport, industry and buildings) are projected in the scenarios to rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play important roles in financing mitigation and adaptation (medium evidence, high agreement). {4.4.4}  Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation (medium confidence). There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation have not yet been fully realized (high confidence). {4.4.4}   4.5 Trade-offs, synergies and interactions with sustainable development Climate change is a threat to sustainable development. Nonetheless, there are many opportunities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses (high confidence). Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond (medium confidence). {3.5, 4.5} Climate change exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor (high confidence). Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). Delaying global mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation in the future. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity (medium evidence, high agreement). {3.1, 3.5, 4.5} Strategies and actions can be pursued now which will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management. In some cases, economic diversification can be an important element of such strategies. The effectiveness of integrated responses can be enhanced by relevant tools, suitable governance structures and adequate institutional and human capacity (medium confidence). Integrated responses are especially relevant to energy planning and implementation; interactions among water, food, energy and biological carbon sequestration; and urban planning, which provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions and more sustainable development (medium confidence). {3.5, 4.4, 4.5} "

Climate change is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our generation, posing a serious risk to the fundamental rights to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living of individuals and communities across the world. This report aims to support government and private decision makers by assessing the relationship between climate change and human rights law. While the United Nations and national governments acknowledge that climate change and the responses to it can impact on human rights, there is less agreement on the corresponding obligations of governments and private actors to address this problem. The relationship between human rights and the environment has been much debated over the past few decades, supported by UNEP, OHCHR and the Human Rights Council-appointed Special Rapporteur, specifically the identification of positive, mutually reinforcing links between the fields of law and policy. This UNEP report sheds light on the human rights obligations of both governments and private actors in responding to climate change, including those relating to rights to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice, as well as obligations relating to adaption and mitigation. The report makes a number of recommendations on how governments and other actors may address climate change. These include the need to recognize the link between climate change and human rights in climate-related processes and activities. The report also highlights the need for greater ambition with regard to mitigation, human rights safeguards for international climate finance mechanisms, financial assistance for developing countries faced with adaptation, and the development of an international mechanism on climate-induced displacement and migration. In addition, the report proposes a number of new human rights-related mechanisms for international coordination and accountability in delivering these outcomes. The Paris agreement is a stepping stone rather than the end objective for climate change action. So I hope that, whatever the outcome, this report will become a central reference for anybody involved in making climate or environmental related decisions in the crucial years ahead.

Foreword
Ten years ago, the Inuit people asked the Inter-American Human Rights Commission to hear their claim that the unchecked effects of climate change were violating their human rights. At the time, the request seemed quixotic, especially after the Commission declined to hear the case. In retrospect, however, the Inuit petition was the first harbinger of a sea-change in how the international community thinks about climate change. In 2007, a group of small island states came together to adopt the Male' Declaration, the first intergovernmental statement that ""climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights."" The next year, they convinced the United Nations Human Rights Council to adopt the first of what became a series of resolutions linking climate change to a host of impacts on human rights. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights then issued a seminal report describing those effects. And in 2010, the State Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed in Cancun that the ""Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."" The relevance of human rights to climate change is now universally recognized. On Human Rights Day last year, December 10, 2014, all 78 UN human rights mandate-holders came together to issue a joint statement underscoring the threat climate change poses to human rights, and unanimously calling on States ""to make sure that human rights are at the core of climate change governance."" At the same time, the human rights norms relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment have been clarified. As the first UN Independent Expert (and as of March 2015, the first Special Rapporteur) on human rights and the environment, I have had the honor of hearing from practitioners and scholars all over the world how human rights are being applied to environmental problems generally and to climate change in particular. The question is no longer whether human rights law has anything to say about climate change, but rather what it says and how it can best be brought to bear. This report is the most detailed and comprehensive study yet undertaken of those questions. It arrives at a critical moment, as the Parties to the UNFCCC meet in Paris to begin a new chapter in our generational effort to defeat climate change. The report provides an indispensable basis for climate policy going forward, helping us see in detail how climate change threatens our ability to enjoy our human rights, and also how the exercise of human rights can inform and guide our climate policies. As the report makes clear, a human rights perspective on climate change not only provides a stark warning of what is at stake - it also gives us a beacon of hope that we can solve this problem together.

Executive Summary
It has long been recognized that a clean, healthy and functional environment is integral to the enjoyment of human rights, such as the rights to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living. Anthropogenic climate change is the largest, most pervasive threat to the natural environment and human societies the world has ever experienced. The latest assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes how observed and predicted changes in climate will adversely affect billions of people and the ecosystems, natural resources, and physical infrastructure upon which they depend. These harmful impacts include sudden-onset events that pose a direct threat to human lives and safety, as well as more gradual forms of environmental degradation that will undermine access to clean water, food, and other key resources that support human life.
As a consequence, climate change will have a profound effect on the enjoyment of human rights for individuals and communities across the planet. This is not merely an abstract, future possibility. Climate change is already affecting temperatures, hydrologic conditions, ecosystem functioning, and agricultural productivity in many regions. Displacement is also an imminent prospect for some communities, such as those situated in the rapidly melting Arctic and low-lying coastal areas.
Further complicating the picture, measures undertaken to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and adapt to climate change can themselves adversely affect the enjoyment of human rights. The international community has pledged to allocate or direct $100 billion (US) per year to funding mitigation and adaptation projects in developing nations. It is critical that as the world endeavors to address climate change, it do so with full respect for human rights.
This report describes how governments and other actors may address climate change in a manner consistent with their obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfill human rights. One key goal is to inform the decisions undertaken by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC). However, the analysis and recommendations set forth in this report are not limited to the current round of international climate negotiations. Another key goal is to inform decisions and actions undertaken by nations, sub-national governments, international organizations and private actors pursuing climate action both within and beyond the context of the UNFCCC in the coming years.
Part I describes the latest projections and observations of how climate change impacts and responses can affect the environment, individuals and communities. Some of the key findings include:
· The impacts of climate change on freshwater resources, ecosystems, and human settlements are already undermining access to clean water, food, shelter, and other basic human needs; interfering with livelihoods; and displacing people from their homes. Even if we remain within the international goal of 2° C of global warming, these impacts will expand dramatically in the coming decades.
· These impacts constitute a serious interference with the exercise of fundamental human rights, such as the rights to life, health, water, food, housing, and an adequate standard of living.
· Mitigation, adaptation, and geoengineering measures can also adversely affect the exercise of human rights. For example, there are documented instances of hydroelectric and biofuel projects that have resulted in human rights violations. There is also a high risk of human rights violations resulting from the implementation of resettlement programs for those who are displaced or at risk of displacement due to climate change, and a corresponding need to ensure that such programs are undertaken with adequate input and consent from those who are relocated.
Part II summarizes the obligations of governments and private actors to respond to these impacts. This section begins by reviewing how UN agencies and national governments have come to understand the relationship
v iii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
between climate change and human rights. It then provides a more detailed discussion of specific obligations in this context. These include:
· Procedural obligations for all governments to ensure that the affected public is: (i) adequately informed about the impacts of climate change and the measures undertaken to both mitigate and adapt to climate change; (ii) adequately involved in public decisions about climate change; and (iii) given access to administrative, judicial, and other remedies when rights are violated as a result of climate change and responses to it.
· Substantive obligations for all governments to: (i) protect human rights from climate-related harms; (ii) respond to the core drivers of climate change by regulating GHG emissions within their jurisdiction; (iii) cooperate internationally to protect human rights against climate-related harms; (iv) address the transboundary impacts of climate change; and (v) safeguard human rights in all mitigation and adaptation activities.
· States also have unique obligations with respect to certain groups, including women, children, and indigenous peoples. Notably, states must obtain free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) before undertaking any measures that would adversely affect the traditional lands and resources of indigenous peoples.
· Private actors also have obligations to address the human rights implications of climate change, and should refer to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights to ensure that they fully respect human rights in all activities.
Part III discusses the implementation of these obligations, focusing primarily on activities undertaken by national governments either within or outside of the UNFCCC context. It documents several recent developments in this area:
· Some states are beginning to recognize the linkages between human rights and climate change in reports submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat, but this is not the case for the majority of developed nations.
· There is a significant ""emissions gap"" between the mitigation commitments set forth in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and the emission reductions required to keep warming at or below 2°C.
· There is also a significant ""adaptation finance gap"" in terms of what will be needed to adapt to climate change and the finance, technology and capacity available.
· Finally, there is a significant ""finance gap"" between the financial and technical assistance that has been given or pledged to developing countries and the resources that will be required to ensure that climate change does not interfere with the exercise of human rights in those countries. This is true even if we do meet the 2°C target.
· Most international climate finance mechanisms are accompanied by safeguards to protect human rights, but there is room for improvement, especially with respect to the monitoring and assessment of these programs and any human rights violations.
ix

Part IV provides recommendations on how national governments and other actors can better integrate human rights considerations into their mitigation and adaptation activities. Our key recommendations for the parties to the UNFCCC include:
· National parties should commit to more ambitious mitigation targets to ensure that the global average temperature increase remains at or below 2°C.
· The COP should recognize the link between climate change and human rights in the Paris Agreement.
· The safeguards for the various climate finance mechanisms should be made uniform and revised to ensure full respect for human rights.
· National parties should increase financial and technical assistance to developing countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, to protect human rights in those areas.
· National parties should continue to discuss the issue of loss and damage in a transparent way that will address the concerns of all affected countries.
The report also contains other recommendations to national governments on measures they can adopt unilaterally to protect human rights in the context of climate change, as well as recommendations to local governments and private actors.

INTRODUCTION
Introduction
The natural environment provides human beings and the communities in which we live with the resources we need to achieve lives of dignity and well-being ­ clean air to breathe; clean water to drink; food to eat; fuels for energy; protection from storms, floods, fires and drought; climate regulation and disease control; and places to congregate for aesthetic, recreational and spiritual enjoyment. These environmental endowments--often referred to as ecosystem services--are at once essential to core survival and vital to human flourishing. As the nations of the world declared in The Future We Want, the outcome document of the 2012 Rio+20 conference, sustainable development requires that we angle toward ""harmony with nature.""1 To achieve this idea, we must balance economic, social and human development with ""ecosystem conservation, regeneration and restoration and resilience in the face of new and emerging challenges.""The nature of the linkages between the environment and human rights has been debated for years. However, it has long been recognized that a clean, healthy and functional environment is integral to the enjoyment of human rights, such as the rights to life, health, food and an adequate standard of living. This recognition offers one reason the international community has banded together through multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) to prohibit illegal trade in wildlife, to preserve biodiversity and marine and terrestrial habitats, to reduce transboundary pollution, and to prevent other behaviors that harm the planet and its residents. In short: Environmental protection protects human rights. At the same time, adherence to human rights--such as those that ensure public access to information and participation in decision making--contributes to more just decisions about the utilization and protection of environmental resources, and protects against the potential for abuse under the auspices of environmental action. Thus, domestic environmental laws and MEAs can both be strengthened through the incorporation of human rights principles, even as they contribute to the ongoing realization of human rights.
Anthropogenic climate change is the largest, most pervasive threat to the natural environment and human rights of our time. Climate change has already begun to have far-reaching environmental impacts, including many adverse effects on wildlife, natural resources and the ecological processes that support access to clean water, food, and other basic human needs. These impacts, combined with direct harms to people, property, and physical infrastructure, pose a serious threat to the enjoyment and exercise of human rights across the world.3 The mandate to take immediate action to both reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change and enact measures that reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to climate change impacts is clear. Yet, certain responses to climate change--including both mitigation and adaptation activities--can also interfere with human rights, as has been the case for a number of hydroelectric and biofuel projects undertaken, in part, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. It is critical that as the world endeavors to address the ""super wicked"" problem of climate change it do so with full respect for human rights.
Over the course of the last decade the international community has arrived at a clear consensus on all of these issues. Yet, while United Nations agencies and national governments have explicitly acknowledged that climate change and responses to climate change can impair human rights, there has been less agreement on the corresponding obligations of governments and private actors to address this problem. The purpose of this report is to inform the decisions undertaken by the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) at COP-21, as well as other activities undertaken by governments and private actors, by providing an up-to-date assessment of the relationship between climate change and human rights law and by making recommendations for incorporating a human rights lens into international and domestic climate action. Part I describes the latest projections and observations of how climate change impacts and responses can affect the environment, individuals and communities and the exercise of human rights. Part II summarizes the obligations of governments and private actors to respond to these impacts. Part III discusses the implementation of these obligations, focusing primarily on activities undertaken by national governments either within or outside of the UNFCCC context. Part IV provides recommendations on how the COP, national governments, and other actors can better integrate human rights considerations into their mitigation and adaptation activities.

PART I
Rising sea levels and changing salinity pose a serious threat to mangrove ecosystems, like those found along the coast of Los Haitises National Park, Dominican Republic.
1.1 Effects of Climate Change on Human Rights
Climate change poses an enormous threat to the lives and well-being of individuals and communities across the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) provides a detailed picture of how the observed and predicted climactic changes will adversely affect millions of people and the ecosystems, natural resources, and physical infrastructure upon which they depend.4 These harmful impacts include sudden-onset events that pose a direct threat to human lives and safety, as well as more gradual forms of environmental degradation that will undermine access to clean water, food, and other key resources that support human life.
Thus, climate change will have a profound effect on the enjoyment of human rights for billions of people. This is not merely an abstract, future possibility. Climate change is already contributing to drought, ecosystem degradation, and food shortages across the world.5 Some regions are hit harder than others, with more clearly attributable linkages to climate change--for example, sea level rise has adversely affected the safety and livelihoods of many coastal inhabitants,6 and rising temperatures are causing significant changes in the Arctic ecosystems that support many indigenous communities.


This section briefly summarizes the findings of the IPCC AR5, specifically the contribution of Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. For each impact area, the effect on specific human rights is also noted.8 A more detailed summary of what these rights entail is provided in Appendix A. The discussion focuses on impacts that are projected to occur under the intermediate emissions scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6.0), corresponding with a global mean temperature increase between 1.1 and 3.1C. The severity of these impacts will be significantly worse in a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), which would correspond with a temperature increase between 2.6 and 4.8°C.
(a) Impacts on Ecosystems and Natural Resources
(i) Freshwater Resources
According to IPCC projections, climate change will significantly reduce surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, thus intensifying competition for water among agriculture, ecosystems, settlements, industry, and energy production, and affecting regional water, energy, and food security.9 Climate change will also increase the frequency of droughts in presently dry areas. The primary drivers of these projected water shortages and droughts include: (i) reduced rainfall, (ii) reduced snowpack, resulting in less snowmelt supplying rivers and streams; (iii) higher temperatures, which increase evaporation from surface water and soils; and (iv) sea level rise, which contributes to saltwater inundation of freshwater resources. In addition, variations in the timing, magnitude, and type of precipitation, as well as temperature increases and sea level rise, can harm freshwater ecosystems by changing stream flow and water quality. This can also lead to the degradation of water supplies for human consumption, agriculture, and other uses.
Affected rights: right to water and sanitation, right to health, right to life, right to food, right to an adequate standard of living.

Climate change will reduce freshwater availability in arid regions that are already suffering from severe water shortages and drought, such as the remote Turkana region of Northern Kenya, where residents had to collect water from dry riverbeds during a period of prolonged drought.

(ii) Terrestrial Ecosystems
Even under the intermediate emissions scenarios there is a ""high risk"" that climate change will cause ""abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems"" in this century.10 Many plant and animal species have already moved their ranges and changed their behavior in response to observed climate change over recent decades, but many others will be unable to move quickly enough or otherwise adapt to changing climactic conditions.11 Thus, the IPCC predicts that climate change will ""reduce the populations, vigor, and viability"" of many species, especially those with spatially restricted populations, and will increase the extinction risk for many species.In addition, increased tree death has been observed in many places worldwide, and there is high confidence that this can be attributed to climate change in some regions.13 ""Forest dieback"" is a major environmental risk, which has potentially significant impacts on climate, biodiversity, water quality, wood production, and livelihoods. The drivers of tree death include high temperatures and drought, and changes in the abundance of insect pests and pathogens (related, in part, to warming).Affected rights: right to food, right to an adequate standard of living, right to health.
(iii) Coastal Systems and Low-lying Areas
The IPCC projects that coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion, primarily due to sea level rise (although increased precipitation and storm surges will also contribute to these impacts). For the two intermediate emissions scenarios, the projected mean sea level rise ranges from .36-.73 meters by 2100, with large regional and local variations.15 There will also likely be an increase in the occurrence of the most severe tropical cyclones.16 Finally, the physical composition of coastal and estuarine ecosystems will be altered by changes in precipitation and river flow, increased water temperatures, and ocean acidification, and this will contribute to a decline in biodiversity and ecosystem productivity along coastlines.The projected increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones, exacerbated by sea level rise and the degradation of ecosystems that provide protection from storms and flooding, will pose a direct threat to human lives and coastal settlements. Without adaptation, IPCC AR5 projects with high confidence that ""hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and will be displaced due to land loss by year 2100.""18 Coastal communities will also be adversely affected by the more gradual degradation of land, soils, freshwater resources, and coastal and estuarine ecosystems.
Affected rights: right to life, right to health, right to housing, right to an adequate standard of living, right to food, right to water, right to property, right to self-determination.
(iv) Ocean Systems
Climate change is altering the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the ocean; scientists have already observed large-scale distribution shifts of species and altered ecosystem composition as a result of ocean warming (e.g., the distribution of many fish and invertebrates have shifted poleward and/or to deeper, cooler waters).19 The IPCC thus predicts that, in response to further warming by 1°C or more, there will be large, irreversible shifts in the spatial distribution of species and seasonal timing of their activities (feeding, growth, development, behaviors, and productivities), which will have implications for ecosystem goods and services.20 It is likely that the spatial shifts of





marine species will cause species richness to increase at mid- and high latitudes, and decrease at tropical latitudes. This has serious implications for marine productivity and food security in tropical areas.Affected rights: right to food, right to an adequate standard of living, right to health.
(v) Food Security and Production Systems
The effects of climate change on crop and terrestrial food production are already evident in several regions of the world. Some high-latitude regions, such as northeast China and the U.K., have experienced a modest increase in productivity as a result of recent warming trends.22 However, changes in temperature and rainfall precipitation have also negatively affected wheat and maize production in many regions.23 There is also evidence that extreme weather events (storms and flooding) have impacted food production, but it is not possible to say that these specific events were caused by climate change (although climate change will increase the likelihood of such events).24 As noted above, climate change is also adversely impacting the productivity of fisheries.
Going forward, it is very likely that climate change will adversely impact the production of major crops (wheat, rice, and maize) in both tropical and temperate regions.25 The food security risk will be greatest in low-latitude countries, where there is high confidence that crop production will be ""consistently and negatively"" affected by climate change in a 2°C warming scenario (and fishery production will also decline).26 Even in the near term, the impacts on global food security could be devastating--for example, 10% of the projected impacts on food security under a 2°C warming scenario showed yield losses of more than 25% for the period 2030-2049.27 Greater losses are expected after 2050.Affected rights: right to food, right to health, right to life, right to an adequate standard of living.
(b) Impacts on Physical Infrastructure and Human Settlements
(i) Urban Areas
Climate-related phenomena such as rising sea levels, coastal storms, heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, drought, increased aridity, water scarcity, and air pollution ""will have profound impacts on a broad spectrum of city functions, infrastructures, and services and will interact with and may exacerbate many existing stresses.""29 Urban climate change-related risks are increasing, with widespread negative impacts on people and their health, livelihoods, and assets, as well as local and national economies and ecosystems.30 These risks are amplified for those who live in informal settlements and hazardous areas, which often lack essential infrastructure and adaptive capacity, as well as individuals that are more vulnerable as a result of age, income, disability, or other factors.Affected rights: right to life, right to housing, right to health, right to water and sanitation, right to an adequate standard of living, right to property.
(ii) Rural Areas
Climate change will affect water supply, food security, and agricultural incomes in rural areas.32 This will have implications for human health, livelihoods, incomes, and migration patterns. Some of the key impacts that create risk for rural communities include: rising temperatures and heat waves, changing precipitation patterns, and
extreme weather events, and the corresponding impacts on human health, water supply, ecosystems, natural resources, crops, and physical structures. Rural areas are also uniquely vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to: (i) a greater dependence on agriculture and natural resources, such as fisheries and forests; and (ii) existing vulnerabilities caused by poverty, lower levels of education, physical isolation, and neglect by policymakers.33 Rural areas in developing countries face the most significant risks due to their geographical location (where climate change impacts are projected to be most severe), lack of adaptive capacity, and heavy reliance on agriculture and natural resources.Affected rights: right to life, right to health, right to housing, right to food, right to water and sanitation, right to an adequate standard of living, right to property.
(iii) Key Economic Sectors and Services
Climate change will affect a variety of economic sectors and services, including energy, water services, transport, agriculture and livestock, forestry, fisheries, tourism, and insurance. Food production systems, water supply systems, and other sectors and services that rely on natural resources in their supply chain are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.35 Electricity systems will also be affected, both through direct climactic impacts (e.g., higher temperatures, lower water supply) and through increased demand for electricity, both of which can compromise electric grid reliability.



Current estimates of global annual economic losses due to additional temperature increases of approximately 2°C are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income, but actual losses are more likely than not to be greater than these estimates, and there will be large differences in economic losses both between and within countries.37 Many of the direct and indirect economic losses will occur due to the decreased productivity of agricultural systems, fisheries, forests, and other natural resources. Other drivers of economic loss include direct impacts on human health, water shortages, and extreme weather events.
Affected rights: right to health, right to an adequate standard of living, right to food, right to water.
(c) Impacts on Livelihoods, Health, and Security
(i) Livelihoods and Poverty Climate-related hazards, including gradual changes and extreme weather events, will affect peoples' livelihoods directly through impacts such as losses in crop yields; the destruction of natural resources, homes, and properties; and displacement. They will also have indirect effects on livelihoods by exacerbating other stressors--for example, climate change can contribute to: (i) increases in the prices of food, energy, and other critical commodities; (ii) political instability and large-scale conflict; and (iii) individual and household-level disturbances.Poverty, political instability, and conflict also undermine the ability of individuals and communities to adapt to climate change (e.g., by fortifying their physical assets or by moving to less vulnerable locations). Thus, climate change is one of many factors that can perpetuate a vicious cycle of poverty, deprivation, and inequality.Affected rights: right to an adequate standard of living, right to health, right to life, right to food, right to water, right to property.

events, owing to greater stress and tension, loss and grief, and disrupted safety nets. Id. at 809. 39 Id. at 817.



(ii) Human Health There is evidence that climate change has already contributed to health problems in some regions, and if climate change continues as projected under various scenarios, the major health impacts will include: (i) greater risk of injury, disease, and death due to more intense heat waves and fires; (ii) increased risk of under-nutrition resulting from diminished food production in poor regions; (iii) health consequences stemming from lost work capacity and reduced labor productivity in vulnerable populations; and (iv) increased risk of food-, water- and vector-borne diseases. 40 In some regions, the combined effects of higher average temperatures and higher humidity will also create significant health risks (especially those regions that already exceed the international standard for safe work activity during the hottest months of the year). Although there may be some positive health impacts, these will be increasingly outweighed by the magnitude and severity of negative health effects.Affected rights: right to health, right to life.
(iii) Human Security Climate change will threaten human security42 by increasing the scarcity of key resources (e.g., water, food, land, and other natural resources), undermining livelihoods, compromising culture and identity, increasing displacement and migration, and challenging the ability of states to provide the conditions necessary for human security. Each of these impacts can directly affect human security, and can also contribute to political instability and violent conflict.Affected rights: right to life, right to an adequate standard of living, right to a nationality, right to self-determination, right to mobility, right to property.
1.2 Effects of Mitigation and Adaptation on Human Rights
The manner in which governments and other actors respond to the challenges of climate change can also affect the enjoyment of human rights. This is true for actions undertaken to mitigate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change, as well as projects undertaken to adapt to the impacts of climate change.
(a) Mitigation There are numerous examples of how certain kinds of mitigation projects undertaken to reduce or sequester GHG emissions can adversely affect the rights of certain groups. The most egregious violations have occurred in the context of:
1. Hydroelectric projects, which often lead to displacement of local people and the destruction of ecosystems upon which they depend, and can also harm the health and livelihoods of people living downstream from the project by reducing river flows.2. Biofuels policies and projects, which can contribute to food shortages and price shocks, additional water stress and scarcity, widespread deforestation, and displacement of indigenous peoples and

small-scale farmers through land acquisitions.45 According to a 2008 Oxfam Report, the ""scramble to supply"" biofuels like palm oil, which was partly driven by EU biofuel targets, exacerbated the food price crises, brought ""30 million people into poverty,"" and put 60 million indigenous people at risk.46 Numerous adverse impacts on local stakeholders and human rights violations have also been documented in the context of specific biofuel projects.Many of these projects have been funded through the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other climate finance mechanisms.48 Concerns have also been raised about the potential effect of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD/REDD+) program on indigenous groups and local stakeholders--specifically, that: (i) there may not be sufficient opportunities for input and consent from the people whose lives and livelihoods are affected by REDD/REDD+ projects; (ii) the commodification of forest carbon sequestration services will lead to land grabs that will displace people who lack adequate legal protections and land tenure; and (iii) the payments for those sequestration services will not be equitably distributed among local stakeholders.On a more general level, there are concerns about the distributional consequences of mitigation policies. Carbon pricing schemes, for example, can have a disproportionate effect on indigenous peoples, the poor, and other
vulnerable groups, who may suffer greater hardship due to the increased price of energy, fuel, and goods.50 Some commentators have also suggested that the commoditization of carbon emissions rights will contribute to, rather than alleviate, existing economic disparities between and within countries.51 These concerns may be alleviated through proper regulatory design, such as by including relief from increased costs or encouraging distributional equity in project siting decisions.
(b) Adaptation
Both the failure to adapt and the implementation of adaptation measures can interfere with human rights, particularly for the most vulnerable. One concern is that some adaptation programs, may benefit one group to the detriment of another--as might be the case for coastal fortifications that protect one community while exposing another to greater risk of erosion and/or flooding. There is also the risk that adaptation measures will be undertaken without the necessary public consultation and may result in outcomes that adversely affect the very persons they aim to protect. There is a risk of human rights violations in the context of relocation and resettlement programs, and a corresponding need to ensure that such programs are undertaken with adequate input and consent from those who are relocated. It should be noted that both the Adaptation Fund and the Green Climate Fund have put in place environmental and social safeguards.
(c) Geoengineering
Geoengineering refers to the deliberate and large-scale manipulation of natural systems through measures aimed at preventing or mitigating the effects of climate change, such as solar radiation management and ocean iron fertilization. Although there have not yet been any significant field tests of geoengineering technology, far less any large-scale geoengineering projects, it is important to note that such projects could seriously interfere with the enjoyment of human rights for millions and perhaps billions of people. For example, one recent study of five potential geoengineering methods deployed in high GHG emissions scenarios concluded that these methods could severely disrupt ocean and terrestrial ecosystems.52 These disruptive effects could undermine the provision of ecosystem goods and services, thus interfering with access to food, clean water, and other key resources. Another study found that proposals for solar radiation management would cause widespread regional-scale changes in precipitation.53 Such shifts could lead to increases in storms and flooding in some areas and drought in others, with adverse impacts on natural ecosystems and human settlements. In addition, there is at this time no mechanism in place to ensure that governments or private parties carrying out geoengineering projects coordinate with the international community, or even disclose information to allow for public participation.

PART II
World Leaders in attendance at Rio+
The Obligations of Governments and Private Actors to Respond to While the linkages between climate change and human rights are clear, it is only in the past decade that UN human rights bodies and national governments have begun to develop consensus on this issue. Thus far, the consensus has extended to the understanding that climate change will interfere with the full enjoyment of human rights, as detailed in Part 1. There is less agreement on the nature of corresponding obligations of governments and private actors to address the human rights implications of climate change. However, there are several well-established and emerging principles that are applicable in this context.
This section provides a brief history of how UN agencies and national governments have come to understand the relationship between climate change and human rights, before turning to a more detailed discussion of specific obligations for international agencies, national governments and private actors.54 The obligations discussed here are primarily based on the rights enumerated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as these comprise the core of international human rights law. State commitments under the UNFCCC and other agreements are also discussed in relation to these core treaty obligations. It is worth noting that a country's legal obligations may differ depending on which treaties it has ratified. It is beyond the scope of this paper to highlight all of these differences; however, there is growing consensus that most or all of the rights enumerated in the UDHR constitute customary international law, and as such, they are binding on all states regardless of treaty ratification status.
2.1 The Progressive Recognition of Human Rights Obligations Relating to the Environment and Climate Change
(a) Recognition of Human Rights Obligations Relating to the Environment
The core international human rights treaties do not recognize a freestanding right to a clean environment. However, it is generally understood that inadequate environmental conditions can undermine the effective enjoyment of other enumerated rights, such as the rights to life, health, water, and food. Some of the UN human rights treaties explicitly recognize this link. The ICESCR, for example, directs states to adopt measures as may be necessary for the ""improvement of all aspects of environmental and industrial hygiene"" in order to fully realize the right to health.56 The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) directs states to account for the ""dangers and risks of environmental pollution"" to ensure full implementation of the right to health for children.In addition, the 1972 Stockholm Declaration recognized that there is ""a fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.""58 While this declaration apparently recognizes a right to an adequate environment, it lacks the force of a binding treaty. Nonetheless, as noted by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), this declaration reflects a ""general recognition of the interdependence and interrelatedness of human rights and environment.""59 OHCHR's conclusion is supported by the UN Independent Expert on Human Rights and the Environment's 2013 mapping report, which concluded that ""[h]uman rights law includes obligations relating to the environment"" that include both procedural obligations and substantive obligations.Finally, the right to a clean environment has either been expressly included in or interpreted as a fundamental component of many regional human rights agreements and national constitutions.(b) Recognition of Human Rights Obligations Relating to Climate Change
Two key events sparked a searching international dialogue on human rights and climate change. First, in December 2005, the Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) submitted a petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) requesting relief for human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change. The petition specifically alleged that the United States--the largest cumulative emitter of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to date--had violated the Inuit's human rights by failing to adopt adequate GHG controls.62 Although the IACHR never issued a decision, the petition did succeed in drawing public attention to the severe effects of global warming on the Inuit and sparking further dialogue about the human rights implications of climate change.Second, in November 2007, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) adopted the Male' Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change. The Male' Declaration was the first international agreement to explicitly recognize that ""climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights."" It also called upon the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC and the UN human rights bodies to launch a collaborative process for assessing the human rights implications of climate change.64 That same month, OHCHR issued a public statement for the Bali Climate Change Conference (COP-13) acknowledging that ""climate change can adversely affect the fundamental human rights of present and future generations"" and reminding the
56 ICESCR Art. 12(2)(b). 57 CRC Art. 24(2)(c). 58 Declaration of the UN Conference on the Human Environment (""Stockholm Declaration""), June 16, 1972, Principle 1. 59 OHCHR further explains: ""the United Nations human rights treaty bodies all recognize the intrinsic link between the environment and the realization of a
range of human rights...."" Report of the OHCHR on the Relationship Between Climate Change and Human Rights, UN Doc.

COP that governments have both moral and legal obligations to protect and promote basic human rights when tackling climate change.Responding to the Male' Declaration, the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) issued a 2008 resolution, expressing concern that climate change ""poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights,"" and directing OHCHR to conduct a ""detailed analytical study of the relationship between climate change and human rights"" in consultation with states and other relevant international organizations and intergovernmental bodies.OHCHR released a report in 2009 describing how the observed and projected impacts of climate change have implications for the enjoyment of human rights and for the obligations of states under international human rights law.67 The report found that ""[a]n increase in global average temperatures of approximately 2° C will have major, and predominantly negative, effects on ecosystems across the globe, on the goods and services they provide,"" that it will ""exacerbate the harmful effects of environmental pollution,"" and that these effects ""have implications for a wide range of human rights.""68 The report discussed specific examples of those rights which relate most directly to climate change-related impacts, including the rights to life, food, water, health, housing, and self-determination. It also highlighted effects on specific groups, including women, children, and indigenous peoples.
Despite concluding that there is ""broad agreement that climate change has generally negative effects on the realization of human rights,"" OHCHR noted that ""it is less obvious whether, and to what extent, such effects can be qualified as human rights violations in a strict legal sense."" This statement reflected the position of many developed countries that were willing to accept that climate change could interfere with the enjoyment of human rights, but would not concede that this interference constituted a violation of international human rights law.69 OHCHR justified this conclusion by citing challenges of causation, attribution, and future harm associated with climate change.Nonetheless, OHCHR concluded that states have a duty to address the effects of climate change on human rights regardless of whether the state has contributed to climate change in a manner which gives rise to specific human rights violations. 71 This is because ""human rights law requires each State to do more than merely refrain from interfering with human rights itself; it also requires the State to undertake due diligence to protect against such harm from other sources.""72 Accordingly, OHCHR identified a number of national level obligations that are applicable in this context, such as the obligation to protect individuals against foreseeable threats of weatherrelated hazards,73 and to provide access to information and participation in decision-making.74 OHCHR also described various ""obligations of international cooperation,"" thus asserting that countries have an obligation to address the extraterritorial effects of climate change.
Since the issuance of this report, UNHRC has issued five resolutions recognizing the linkages between climate change and human rights.76 These include:
· Resolution 10/4 (2009), which recognized that international cooperation would be ""necessary"" to enable implementation of the UNFCCC.· Resolution 18/22 (2011), which affirmed that ""human rights obligations, standards and principles have the potential to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy, and sustainable outcomes"" and that ""in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence"" as a result of climate change."" Resolution 18/22 also called for additional dialogue on how to address the adverse impacts of climate change on the full enjoyment of human rights.· Resolution 26/27 (2014), which explicitly noted the ""urgent importance of continuing to address, as they relate to States' human rights obligations, the adverse consequences of climate change for all, particularly in developing countries and its people whose situation is most vulnerable to climate change, especially those in a situation of extreme poverty, and deteriorating livelihood conditions.""· Resolution 29/15 (2015), which contained effectively the same language on ""States' human rights obligations"" as Resolution 26/27, and called for new study on the relationship between climate change and the human right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.Although UNHRC has not yet issued a clear declaration on the obligations of governments or other actors to respond to the human rights implications of climate change, there is ample evidence that certain obligations do exist. Specifically, the Independent Expert's 2013 mapping report on Human Rights Obligations Relating to the Enjoyment of a Safe, Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment outlines numerous statements from the UN human rights treaties and treaty bodies charged with overseeing them, other UN bodies and mechanisms, regional human rights systems, and international environmental instruments, all recognizing various human rights obligations related to climate change.81 The results of that report are incorporated into the analysis in Section 2.2, below.
The UNFCCC COP also formally recognized the linkages between climate change and human rights in the 2010 Cancun Agreements, where the Parties agreed to emphasize that countries ""should, in all climate change-related actions, fully respect human rights.""82 But the COP has done very little in the past five years to elaborate on how countries should fulfill that goal. In the interim, numerous declarations and submissions have been made calling for the COP to incorporate human rights considerations into its decisions and agreements, and most notably, the 2015 Paris Agreement.

2.2 Governmental Obligations to Address The obligations of governments with respect to international human rights are frequently characterized as entailing three types of duties:· The duty to respect human rights, a negative obligation, which requires states to refrain from taking actions that would interfere with or curtail the enjoyment of human rights.
· The duty to protect human rights against violations by third parties.
· The duty to fulfill human rights, a positive obligation, which requires states to undertake measures to ensure the realization of rights for all members of society.
Some documents also refer to a duty to ""promote"" human rights, which can be understood as a related but distinct obligation to ""promote universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights.""Another way to conceptualize government duties in this context is to divide them into 1) procedural obligations, 2) substantive obligations, and 3) obligations in relation to individuals who are members of specific groups. This approach is particularly helpful for understanding the linkages between different obligations, and so we use it here.

For each set of obligations, we describe the ""hard law"" (treaty provisions, case law) underpinning the obligations, as well as soft law (UN declarations, comments from UN treaty bodies) and interpretations from UN special rapporteurs and other experts. As noted above, the actual scope of legal obligations for any specific country may depend on treaty ratification status, except to the extent that some of these obligations may now constitute customary international law that is binding all countries.(a) Procedural Obligations
Human rights law imposes various procedural obligations on governments with respect to the environmental impacts of their activities. These include obligations to gather and disseminate information about environmental impacts, to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making, and to provide access to remedies for environmental harm. These obligations are based in civil and political rights, but ""they have been clarified and extended in the environmental context on the basis of the entire range of human rights at risk from environmental harm.""As discussed below, governments also have unique obligations with respect to decisions that affect indigenous peoples and their lands, such as a duty to obtain the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of indigenous peoples before undertaking decisions that would adversely affect any lands or resources that they have traditionally owned or occupied.
(i) Ensuring Access to Information and Conducting Environmental Assessments
ICCPR Art. 19 and UDHR Art. 19 recognize the right of all persons ""to seek, receive and impart information."" At a minimum, the ICCPR and UDHR require states to provide public access to any government information of public interest.88 The Human Rights Committee (HR Committee), the treaty body for the ICCPR, has not explicitly discussed whether the right of access to information entails a corresponding obligation for states to conduct environmental impact assessments (EIA). However, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held that, as a matter of customary international law, states have an obligation vis-à-vis other states to conduct environmental assessments where there is a risk that a proposed activity ""may have a significant adverse impact in a transboundary context, in particular, on a shared resource"" and disclose the results of that EIA to countries that may be adversely affected. 89 Accordingly, states should assess how activities within their jurisdiction will adversely affect the climate (a shared resource) and provide adequate notice to the international community. For example, states should conduct GHG assessments for activities that are likely to have significant GHG impacts--such as programmatic decisions about fossil fuel development, large fossil fuel-fired power plants, and fuel economy standards--and make the results publicly available.
The right of access to information is generally viewed as a prerequisite to the exercise of other procedural rights relating to public participation and access to remedies, and these procedural rights have been interpreted as critical to the exercise of substantive human rights, such as the rights to life, health, and privacy.90 As such, many regional human rights courts have held that states have an obligation to assess and disclose foreseeable environmental risks as part of their positive duties to protect, respect, and fulfill various human rights.91 This includes any environmental risks caused by government activity, as well as other environmental risks that threaten the exercise of human rights (since states have an obligation to protect rights against harms caused by third parties).

The UNFCCC outlines similar obligations with respect to assessing and disclosing information related to climate change. Specifically, Art. 4(1)(h) requires states to ""[p]romote and cooperate in the full, open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change, and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies."" Art. 6 also directs the Parties to promote and facilitate at the national and, as appropriate, subregional and regional levels, ""public access to information on climate change and its effects."" Several other provisions direct the Parties to provide information on national GHG emissions and measures taken to address climate change and its effects.The right to information and corresponding obligation to acquire information through environmental impact assessments (EIA) and other mechanisms, and to communicate that information to the public, are also included in the Rio Declaration,93 the Aarhus Convention,94 the Espoo Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context, the Kyiv (SEA) Protocol, and a variety of other MEAs.95 The domestic laws of numerous states also contain such requirements.Several expert bodies have explicitly directed states to account for climate change when fulfilling their obligations to evaluate environmental risks and disclose environmental information to the public.97 For example, in Resolution 65/178 (2011), the UN General Assembly called for urgent international, regional and national efforts to address the impacts of climate change on food security.98 And regarding the right to water, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has determined that State parties should establish mechanisms for assessing the impacts of climate change, desertification and other environmental harms on watersheds.(ii) Public Participation in Environmental Decision-making
The UDHR (Art. 21) and ICCPR (Art. 25) both recognize the fundamental right of everyone to take part in the government of their country and in the conduct of public affairs. In addition, a variety of human rights treaty bodies have determined that governments have an obligation to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making in order to protect human rights against environmental harm.100 The UNFCCC also directs states to promote and facilitate ""public participation in addressing climate change and its effects and developing adequate responses.""101 Other multilateral environmental instruments similarly provide for public participation.
92 UNFCCC Arts. 4(2)(b), 7(2)(b), 12. 93 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992), Principles 10 and 17. 94 The Aarhus Convention outlines a comprehensive set of obligations relating to access to information, public participation in decision-making, and access
to justice in environmental matters, and provides a useful gauge for a country's compliance with obligations under other treaties (notably, the ICCPR). For example, the Convention defines ""environmental information"" for assessment and disclosure purposes; directs parties to take specific, affirmative steps to promote access to information. The Convention also restricts the circumstances under which governments may refuse a request for environmental information.

General Assembly Resolution 67/210 (2013) recognizes the ""need to engage a broad range of stakeholders at the global, regional, national and local levels, including national, subnational and local governments, private businesses and civil society, and including youth and persons with disabilities, and that gender equality and the effective participation of women and indigenous peoples are important for effective action on all aspects of climate change.""
The precise standard of what constitutes ""adequate"" or ""effective"" public participation is not always clear. Terms such as ""full and informed participation"" and ""meaningful consultation"" are often used to describe this requirement. At a minimum, this requires: (1) assessment and disclosure of environmental impacts, as discussed above; (2) effective communication of those impacts--e.g., in a language and venue that is accessible to the persons who will be affected; and (3) an opportunity for affected persons to ""voice their concerns.""It is particularly important to invite and facilitate public participation in decisions that affect vulnerable groups,104 and for decisions concerning the displacement or resettlement of certain groups. OHCHR emphasizes that ""adequate and meaningful consultation with affected persons should precede decisions to relocate people away from hazardous zones.""105 The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, François Crépeau, has also contributed to this discussion by recommending certain obligations and good practices for States to address the impacts of climate change on migrants.(iii) Access to Administrative, Judicial, and Other Remedies
The UDHR, ICCPR, and ICESCR all recognize that states should provide an ""effective remedy"" for human rights violations. The respective human rights bodies for these treaties have clarified that such remedies extend to human rights violations caused by environmental harms. The obligation to provide access to justice and/or an effective remedy is also enshrined in the Rio Declaration, the Aarhus Convention, and a variety of other multilateral environmental and human rights agreements.There is both a procedural and a substantive dimension to this obligation. First, states must provide access to administrative and judicial proceedings to adjudicate claims of human rights violation (the procedural element). But various expert bodies have asserted that states must also ensure that compensation or other forms of redress are available when violations do occur (the substantive dimension). The CESCR, for example, has noted that states should ensure that adequate compensation, alternative accommodation, and resettlement opportunities are provided to indigenous communities and other groups who are displaced by large infrastructure projects and deforestation.108 More generally, the former Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, Raquel Rolnik, has stated that human rights standards ""require the existence of institutional forms of redress for grievances, compensation in response to inevitable damages and an evaluation of the distributional impacts of projects and effects.""The UNFCCC does not explicitly recognize a right of access to justice or remedies for individuals. Article 14 outlines a procedure for the settlement of disputes between countries concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention.110 More notably, Paragraph 92 of the Cancun Agreements describes the need to consider ""information from those affected, and evidence of actual impacts"" of response measures (adaptation and mitigation).111 But the

COP has yet to establish any clear mandate for countries, climate finance mechanisms, or other entities to ensure access to a grievance mechanism for those who are harmed by the impacts of or responses to climate change.
(b) Substantive Obligations
Both the ICESCR and ICCPR contain substantive rights, such as the rights to life, health, and an adequate standard of living, accompanied by a combination of: (i) negative obligations for states to refrain from taking action that would interfere with rights, (i.e., a duty to respect rights); and (ii) positive obligations for states to protect and fulfill rights.112 As noted by the UN General Assembly:
""Each state has a prime responsibility and duty to protect, promote and implement all human rights and fundamental freedoms, inter alia, by adopting such steps as may be necessary to create all conditions necessary in the social, economic, political, and other fields, as well as the legal guarantees required to ensure that all persons under its jurisdiction, individually and in association with others, are able to enjoy all those rights and freedoms in practice.""Based on these obligations, the CESCR, regional courts, and UN special rapporteurs have concluded that states have a general duty to ""adopt legal and institutional frameworks that protect against, and respond to, environmental harm that may or does interfere with the enjoyment of human rights.""114 The framework must ensure that the state will respect human rights in all of its activities and decisions, and include protections to prevent third parties from creating environmental harms that interfere with the exercise of human rights.115 In addition, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has held that states must also take reasonable measures to protect citizens against the reasonably foreseeable effects of natural disasters.The adverse impacts of climate change clearly qualify as ""environmental harms"" that can interfere with the exercise of human rights. Thus, states must enact legal and institutional frameworks to protect against and respond to those impacts. More specifically, there are at least five types of obligations that may arise in this context: (1) adaptation obligations, requiring states to enact frameworks for protecting people against the effects of climate change; (2) domestic mitigation obligations, requiring states to regulate the sources of GHG emissions; (3) international cooperation obligations, requiring states to participate in international negotiations for an effective global climate agreement; (4) transboundary mitigation obligations, requiring states to mitigate the effect of their activities on the human rights of persons outside of their jurisdiction; and (5) an obligation to ensure that mitigation and adaptation activities do not themselves contribute to human rights violations.
There are at least three overarching principles which apply to all of these obligations. First, states are ""obliged to take measures towards the full realization of economic, social, and cultural rights to the maximum extent of their available resources.""117 This means that states ""must take deliberate, concrete and targeted measures, making the most efficient use of available resources, to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible towards the full realization of rights.""

Second, although international human rights law generally requires the ""progressive realization"" of economic, social, and cultural rights, there are some obligations which require immediate implementation. For example, states must guarantee non-discrimination in access to economic, social and cultural rights, irrespective of resource constraints.119 States also have an immediate obligation to ensure, at the very least, ""minimum essential levels"" of each right that is enshrined in the ICESCR.120 In addition, states have an immediate obligation to refrain from undertaking actions that cause a violation of any human rights.
Third, states have an obligation to protect all rights against third party abuses. As interpreted by the HR Committee, this means that states must ""take appropriate measures or to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, investigate or redress"" any human rights violations caused by third parties.(i) Adaptation Obligations: Protecting Human Rights From Climate-Related Harms
Article 6 of the ICCPR recognizes that ""[e]very human being has the inherent right to life"" and that no person ""shall be arbitrarily deprived of life."" The HR Committee has noted that the right to life ""should not be interpreted narrowly"" and that ""the protection of this right requires that States adopt positive measures"" to protect life.122 The ICESCR contains a number of additional rights--such as the rights to health and an adequate standard of living--which also require positive action from the state for their implementation.As discussed in Part 1, the effects of climate change will threaten the lives, health, well-being, and livelihoods of hundreds of millions if not billions of people in the coming decades. States have an obligation to enact legal and institutional frameworks to protect human rights against these effects. This is true regardless of whether the state is responsible for those effects because, as noted above, the ICCPR and ICESCR both include obligations to protect human rights from harms caused by third parties. Presumably, this would encompass a more pressing obligation to protect citizens from imminent, life-threatening harms (such as more severe storms and flooding), as well as an ongoing obligation to implement adaptation measures to alleviate the projected impacts of climate change on people and their livelihoods. The ECtHR has issued several decisions which, although not binding under the ICCPR or ICESCR, do provide insight on the nature of a state's positive obligation to protect the human right to life in this context.125 For example, in Budayeva and Others v. Russia, the ECtHR determined that Russian authorities had violated the right to life when: (i) the authorities knew that there was a risk of a mud-slide, (ii) they did not implement land planning and emergency relief policies, (iii) they did not adequately inform the public about the risk; and (iv) eight citizens died as a result of the mud-slide.126 The Lahore High Court in Pakistan also recently issued a decision in which it held that the national government had violated the fundamental rights of its citizens, including the right to life, by failing to implement adaptation measures recommended in the 2012 National Climate Policy and Framework.The UNFCCC does not recognize a right to adaptation, but it does call upon all parties to ""[c]ooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, water resources and agriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas,


Damage to villages and infrastructure following Cyclone Sidr, which hit southern Bangladesh in November particularly in Africa, affected by drought and desertification, as well as floods.""128 In addition, it calls upon developed countries to provide assistance to developing countries to address the adverse effects of climate change in those countries.129 These directives complement the human rights obligations noted above.
The Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015) and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (20152030), endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly,130 also outline a set of obligations for countries to build resilience of their citizens to disasters. The Sendai Framework explicitly recognizes that ""[m]anaging the risks of disasters is aimed at protecting persons and their property, health, livelihoods and productive assets, as well as cultural and environmental assets, while promoting and protecting all human rights, including the right to development.""131 It also recognizes that each state has the ""primary responsibility"" to take ""effective measures to reduce disaster risk"" within its jurisdiction.132 States can refer to the principles and directives outlined in the Sendai Framework in order to implement their human rights obligations with respect to climate-related disaster planning and risk reduction.
Finally, OHCHR notes that states are ""legally bound to address [climate-related] vulnerabilities in accordance with the principle of equality and non-discrimination.""133 Specifically, the non-discrimination principle requires that states ""identify marginalized or vulnerable individuals and groups; address specific needs through `targeted and differentiated interventions;' and tackle underlying power imbalances and structural cases of `differential vulnerability' within and between households while building the ecological resilience necessary to reduce vulnerability and achieve threshold needs.""

Although states have discretion to decide how to protect human rights against climate-related effects, taking into account their resource constraints and national contexts, there may be some minimum measures that would be required as a matter of international, regional, or domestic human rights law. These might include measures that are necessary to protect lives from imminent threats, such as early-warning systems and risk notification,135 which tie into the obligation to disclose information, discussed above; improvements to physical infrastructure to reduce the risk of floods or other hazards; emergency response plans; and the provision of disaster relief and humanitarian assistance in times of emergency.Some of the UN Special Rapporteurs have further expanded upon the measures that states should take to protect human rights in the context of climate-related disasters and slow-onset degradation. Some of the proposed measures include:
· Urban Planning and Warning Systems: (1) Risk assessments in urban planning, rural development projects, and housing design (with a particular focus on vulnerable areas).137 (2) Establishing necessary infrastructure and services to prevent extreme weather events from becoming disasters.138 (3) Providing warning information to all neighborhoods to allow dwellers to seek protection and take risk reduction actions.139 (4) Providing access to ""affordable and well-located land for the urban poor"" in order to ""avoid further unplanned settlement expansions"" that contribute to climate change vulnerability.· Displacement and Resettlement: (1) Conducting risk assessments, providing public participation risk assessments, providing public participation opportunities, and ensuring that there are human rights safeguards for all programs to manage migration and displacement.141 (2) Ensuring adequate resettlement opportunities for those who are temporarily displaced by climate change-related disasters, and ensuring that ""temporary relocation must last only as long as absolutely necessary and all displaced persons should have the right to return to their homes without discrimination.""142 (3) Ensuring that the UNFCCC and related climate change frameworks address ""the nexus between the effects of climate change and displacement"" and that the least developed countries are provided with technical assistance, financial resources and/or other enhancements to domestic capacity to cope with climate-related displacement.143 (4) Adhering to the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, which describe how human rights considerations should be incorporated into government actions to prevent and manage internal displacement.· Access to Food: (1) Addressing food shortages and price shocks that are caused or aggravated by climate related phenomena.145 (2) Developing social safety nets to ensure that those who are adversely affected by climate change (e.g., through displacement or loss of livelihoods) will have access to food.(ii) Domestic Mitigation Obligations
States may also have an obligation to respond to the core causes of climate change ­ anthropogenic emissions of GHGs and the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere. The CESCR, for example, has stated that State Parties to the ICESCR should mitigate the effects of climate change in order to safeguard the economic, social and cultural

rights of their citizens (although it has not expressly characterized this as an obligation).147 The former Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing has also asserted that ""Human rights standards require all countries to seek to reduce their harmful emissions to the global atmosphere, with a view to reducing their negative effect on the enjoyment of human rights.""148 The international human rights courts have not yet addressed the nature of a state's obligations to mitigate GHG emissions, but there is at least one domestic case requiring a national government to accelerate its emission reduction efforts in order to fulfill a duty of care to its citizens,149 and another requiring the government to implement its national climate change policy (which included mitigation objectives) in order to protect the fundamental rights of its citizens.150 In addition, cases alleging a violation of fundamental rights as a result of governmental inaction on climate change have been filed in the United States151 and Belgium.In this context, questions of causation are relevant. Many countries have made and are making relatively small contributions to climate change; their GHG emissions reductions will not significantly impact their peoples' enjoyment of human rights. By contrast, emissions reductions by the U.S., China, the E.U. and other major emitters matter a great deal.The principles and goals set forth in the UNFCCC provide a useful frame for these mitigation obligations. For one thing, the treaty recognizes that all states share a duty to ""prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the atmosphere"" as necessary to ""allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.""154 In the 2010 Cancun Agreements, the COP agreed that, to achieve this goal, they must ""hold the increase in global average temperature below 2°C e above pre-industrial levels,"" and that they should consider strengthening this long-term goal so as to hold the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C.155 Many UN independent experts and other stakeholders feel that to protect fundamental human rights, it will be necessary to keep global warming well below the 2°C goal.156 Such an approach would accord with some of the core principles of many international environmental instruments (including the UNFCCC), such as the precautionary principle157 and intergenerational equity.The UNFCCC also provides insight on how to allocate the responsibility for achieving this target. Under the principle of common-but-differentiated responsibilities, developed countries must take the lead in ensuring that we remain within the 2°C global warming goal established under the UNFCCC.159 However, developing countries also have an obligation to incorporate GHG mitigation goals into their development plans, laws, and policies.160 This approach accords with fundamental principles of equity, responsibility, and burden sharing.Finally, the Oslo Principles, although not endorsed by the UN or binding on any states, contain a useful framework for conceptualizing state obligations in this context. The principles explicitly reference the need to protect human rights and clarify the obligations that states have to reduce GHG emissions, taking into account cost and other factors.(iii) International Cooperation Obligations
The ICESCR requires parties to ""take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means.""163 The UDHR and ICCPR also recognize an obligation of states to ""promote universal respect for, and observance of"" human rights and freedoms.164 Finally, in the UN Charter, all UN member states ""pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the Organization for the achievement of [inter alia] universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all."" Based on this language, both the CESCR and the OHCHR have concluded that states have an obligation to address the extraterritorial impacts of environmental harm caused by activities within their jurisdiction.166 These have been framed as ""obligations of international cooperation,"" and they require that states:
· Refrain from interfering with the enjoyment of human rights in other countries
· Take measures to prevent third parties (e.g. private companies) over which they hold influence from interfering with the enjoyment of human rights in other countries
· Take steps through international assistance and cooperation, depending on the availability of resources, to facilitate fulfillment of human rights in other countries, including disaster relief, emergency assistance, and assistance to refugees and displaced persons
· Ensure that human rights are given due attention in international agreements and that such agreements do not adversely impact upon human rights.The OHCHR has noted that these standards and principles are ""consistent with and further emphasize"" the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibilities"" contained in the UNFCCC,168 and the various provisions of the UNFCCC which call for international cooperation and financial and technical assistance between countries.According to one author, the obligation of international cooperation would likely require the following actions from countries with respect to climate change: (i) setting mitigation targets that are consistent with the full enjoyment of human rights (and implementing those targets); (ii) funding adaptation measures in vulnerable countries; and (iii) crafting international agreements that do not adversely affect human rights.170 Other components of this obligation may include the provision of financial assistance and/or technology transfer for climate change mitigation measures in countries that lack resources to implement those measures, and compensating people for harm incurred as a result of climate change.

(iv) Obligations to Address Transboundary Harm
States also have a duty to address transboundary environmental harms, which is closely related to, and partially premised on, their duties of international cooperation. This obligation also derives in part from customary international law, which primarily deals with a state's obligations vis-à-vis other states, as opposed to a state's obligations to individuals.
The ICJ has clarified that, as a matter of customary international law, it is ""every State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary to the rights of other States.""171 Specifically, there is a ""principle of prevention"" that requires a state to ""use all the means at its disposal in order to avoid activities which take place in its territory, or in any area under its jurisdiction, causing significant damage to the environment of another State.""172 The ICJ's holding is consistent with the principle of sic utere (also known as the ""no harm"" rule).It is less clear whether states have an independent obligation, as a matter of international human rights law, to prevent transboundary harms where the harms originate from activities that occur within their own jurisdiction but have adverse effects on the enjoyment of human rights in other jurisdictions. As noted above, the CESCR has interpreted the ICESCR as encompassing extraterritorial obligations of this nature. The language of the convention strongly supports this interpretation--states are directed to cooperate internationally, and to use the maximum available resources, to protect the numerated human rights for all persons.174 There is no jurisdictional limitation. However, many developed countries have disagreed with this interpretation, and thus there is not a clear consensus on the extraterritorial application of the convention.

McCorquodale eds. 2007).
Unlike the ICESCR, the ICCPR does include a jurisdictional limit. Specifically, it directs each party ""to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction"" the rights recognized therein.176 The HR Committee has interpreted this as requiring states to respect and ensure civil and political rights for all persons within their ""effective control.""177 For example, the Committee has noted that a state may not actively violate the right to life of persons detained abroad, noting that:
""It would be unconscionable to so interpret the responsibility under article 2 of the Covenant as to permit a State party to perpetrate violations of the Covenant on the territory of another State, which violations it could not perpetrate on its own territory.""However, the Committee has not held that a state has an obligation to protect the right to life of persons outside of its jurisdiction against harms caused by activities within its jurisdiction, and it would be a stretch to say that the ""effective control"" standard encompasses such situations. That said, there are several HR Committee resolutions that recognize the importance of international cooperation in this context, without explicitly recognizing an obligation of international cooperation.The idea that states have extraterritorial obligations to prevent transboundary environmental harm is supported by other international declarations and statements from authoritative bodies. For example, Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration provides that states have ""the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.""180 More generally, the UNFCCC and other MEAs all recognize that states have obligations to address the effect of their activities on global resources, such as the climate, oceans, and biodiversity.181 Indeed, the UNFCCC's principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is premised on the idea that the states most responsible for climate change must take the lead in order to address the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and people across the world, not just their own citizens.
(v) Safeguarding Human Rights in Mitigation and Adaptation Activities
Finally, international law requires states and other governmental actors to ensure that the actions they undertake to mitigate or adapt to climate change do not violate human rights, as part of their duty to respect human rights.
This obligation applies to both specific projects and broader policy decisions. For example, in the CESCR Statement on the World Food Crisis, the Committee ""urge[d] State parties to address the structural causes at the national and international levels, including by . . . [i]mplementing strategies to combat global climate change that do not negatively affect the right to adequate food and freedom from hunger, but rather promote sustainable agriculture, as required by Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.""182 CESCR's recommendation in this context was no doubt informed by concerns about biofuel projects and their impact on food security.

The UNFCCC COP also explicitly recognized this issue in Art. 8 of the Cancun Agreements, which recognize that the Parties ""should, in all climate change-related actions, fully respect human rights as enunciated in the outcome of the sixteenth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention.""183 UNHRC Resolutions 18/22 and 26/27 include similar language.The Cancun Agreements also include several paragraphs outlining principles for how Parties should address and mitigate the ""economic and social consequences of response measures"" on vulnerable groups and developing countries. For example, paragraph 89 urges developed country Parties to:
""strive to implement policies and measures to respond to climate change in such a way as to avoid negative social and economic consequences for developing country Parties, taking into account Article 3 of the Convention, and to assist these Parties to address such consequences by providing support, including financial resources, transfer of technology and capacity-building, in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention, to build up the resilience of societies and economies negatively affected by response measures.""Appendix I of the Cancun Agreements also outlines a set of safeguards for protecting vulnerable groups in the context of mitigation actions in the forest sector. These safeguards are evaluated in Part 3.
(c) Obligations to Specific Groups
The principle of non-discrimination is included in the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the ICESCR.186 In accordance with this principle, countries must ensure that the measures they take to address climate change (and the measures they take to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights) are implemented in a non-discriminatory fashion. These and other agreements also recognize that individuals who are part of certain groups--notably, women, indigenous groups, and children--are entitled to special protections.
The UNFCCC does not speak of specific individuals or groups, but does recognize that some countries and ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and as such, they warrant special consideration and adaptation assistance.187 In addition, the Cancun Agreements provide more detailed instructions on how the parties should address the impacts of climate change on people who are vulnerable to climate change as a result of geography, gender, age, indigenous or minority status, and disability.(i) Women
The Cancun Agreements recognize that gender equality and the effective participation of women are important for effective action on all aspects of climate change.189 They also discuss the need to address gender considerations in the implementation of REDD projects.190 However, they do not outline any specific requirements for countries to ensure that women are adequately involved in the various phases of government decision-making related to climate change mitigation and adaptation, or to address the potentially discriminatory effect of certain actions on women.
The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) provides a more detailed framework for protecting the rights of women and ensuring that they have a voice in public decisions.191 However, the Convention is more geared towards preventing acts of overt discrimination, as opposed to addressing the discriminatory effects of actions on women. As such, the Convention does not provide much guidance on government obligations relating to the disproportionate burden that women will likely experience as a result of climate change.

(ii) Children
The Cancun Agreements recognize the need to ""fully account"" for the adverse effects of climate change on children,192 but do not contain additional instructions on how countries should do this. The Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines a variety of additional requirements that are relevant to the protection of children in the context of climate change. Article 24 is most relevant--it recognizes the ""right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health"" and outlines how states should ensure full implementation of the right. For example, states ""shall take appropriate measures"" to ""combat disease and malnutrition, including within the framework of primary health care, through, inter alia, the application of readily available technology and through the provision of adequate nutritious foods and clean drinking-water, taking into consideration the dangers and risks of environmental pollution.""In addition, the CESCR has directed states to ""adopt comprehensive and integrated strategies and programmes to ensure that there is sufficient and safe water for present and future generations.""194 The UNFCCC also has an intergenerational focus, with the Parties agreeing that they ""should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind.""(iii) Indigenous Peoples
OHCHR has recognized that climate change ""poses a serious threat to indigenous peoples, who often live in marginal lands and fragile ecosystems which are particularly sensitive to alterations in the physical environment.""196 This threat could potentially undermine the right to self-determination for indigenous peoples, which is recognized in both the ICCPR and the ICESCR,197 as well as the rights outlined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Cancun Agreements explicitly refer to indigenous rights, and call for public participation of indigenous peoples in decisions about forestry and land use projects.The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples contains particularly robust requirements for states to engage and obtain consent from indigenous peoples before undertaking actions that will adversely affect those peoples. For example, it specifies that indigenous peoples shall not be relocated from their lands or territories without ""free, prior and informed consent... and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return.""199 It also requires states to provide redress measures in the event that land or property is taken from these people without their consent.200 These provisions are particularly relevant when governments are implementing or authorizing mitigation and adaptation projects that will affect lands or resources owned or used by indigenous peoples. Indeed, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has decided several cases involving the obligation to protect indigenous rights in the context of projects that affect indigenous lands and resources that would appear applicable in these circumstances.In addition, the Declaration recognizes that ""Indigenous peoples have the collective right to live in freedom, peace and security"" and a corresponding right ""not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture.""202 Climate change will likely have a devastating effect on many of the ecosystems that indigenous people rely on for their livelihoods and cultural identity, and as such, the effects of climate change could be construed as a violation of this principle.203 Although it may be difficult to establish causation for the purposes of bringing a successful claim before an international or regional human rights court, it is nonetheless reasonable that major emitters do have an obligation to curtail their emissions so as to avoid the destruction of indigenous cultures.
2.3 Private Sector Obligations to Address As discussed above, states have an obligation to protect human rights against abuses by third parties, as well as an obligation to provide access to an adequate remedy, judicial or non-judicial, when human rights are violated by non-state actors.
The core international human rights treaties do not directly address the obligations of private parties to respect human rights, but there are some standards for non-state actors that countries are beginning to incorporate into domestic law. These standards are enshrined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the ""Ruggie Principles""), proposed by UN Special Representative John Ruggie and endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011.204 The Ruggie Principles provide additional guidance to countries on how to fulfill their obligations in this context, as well as principles that are directly applicable to private actors. The foundational principles for private actors include, inter alia:
1. Businesses should respect human rights by avoiding infringing on the human rights of others and addressing any adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved.
2. The rights that must be respected by businesses include, at minimum, the rights recognized in the International Bill of Rights (UDHR, ICCPR, ICESCR) and the principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
3. To meet their human rights responsibilities, businesses should implement policies and processes appropriate for their size and circumstances, so as to safeguard human rights in all aspects of their operation.
4. Businesses should also carry out human rights due diligence, which includes assessing actual and potential human rights impacts, integrating and acting upon the findings, tracking responses, and communicating how impacts are addressed.
5. Where businesses identify that they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts, they should provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes.A complete assessment of non-state actors' obligations is beyond the scope of this report, but it is worth noting that non-state obligations with respect to human rights are also outlined in the Oslo Principles (which deal specifically with climate change).206 In addition, the International Bar Association (IBA) published a recent report on advancing climate justice which contains recommendations on how corporations can implement the Ruggie Principles through the implementation of corporate responsibility policies and other actions.

Implementation Assessment
The parties to the UNFCCC have taken many important steps, both individually and jointly, to address the causes and impacts of climate change. However, it appears that there is still a need to mainstream human rights considerations into the decisions of individual countries, the COP and the UNFCCC's various arms and mechanisms, and to undertake additional measures to address the effect of climate change on human rights.
This section will briefly evaluate the adequacy of national and international responses in six contexts: (1) formal recognition of the human rights-climate change nexus in national communications; (2) mitigation actions and commitments; (3) adaptation actions and commitments; (4) financial assistance to developing countries; (5) respect for procedural rights in climate policy and planning; and (6) safeguards in international climate finance mechanisms.
3.1 Human Rights and Climate Change in National Communications
As of Oct. 5, 2015, 119 INDCs had been submitted, covering 146 countries.208 Among these,
· 14 discussed the linkages between climate change and human rights.· 48 discussed gender equality, mainstreaming, and empowerment.

IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT


· 14 discussed the impact of climate change and mitigation and/or adaptation responses on indigenous peoples.Notably, all of the INDCs that discuss any of these three topics were submitted by developing countries and least developed countries. These countries often noted the need to implement their mitigation and adaptation targets with full respect for human rights or related issues (e.g., gender equality, indigenous rights), without providing much detail on how this would occur.212 The INDCs submitted by developed countries do not mention human rights, gender, indigenous peoples, or other relevant considerations (e.g., equity, poverty alleviation, and ensuring access to basic goods and services).A report published by the Mary Robinson Foundation in 2014 also concluded that the majority of country reports to the UNFCCC and the UNHRC do not address the link between human rights and climate change.214 Some of the key findings from that report included:
· 49 countries explicitly mentioned human rights in National Communications and National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs) submitted to the UNFCCC between 2010 and 2014. This included 39% of the National Communications and 4% of the NAPAs that were submitted during that period.· Procedural rights were more frequently discussed than substantive rights in the National Communications submitted to the UNFCCC. 20% of these communications discussed procedural rights (10% developed/ 10% developing), and 13% discussed substantive rights (1% developed/12% developing).· 45 countries explicitly mentioned the human rights impact of climate change in their national reports to the Universal Periodic Review of the HRC between 2010 and 2014. These included 12% of the submissions from developed countries, 29% of the submissions from developing countries, 32% of submissions from least developed countries (LDCs), and 45% of the submissions from small island development states (SIDS).· Only 12 countries made the link between human rights and climate change in reports to both the UNFCCC and the HRC.The report concluded that further steps are needed to ensure that countries will integrate human rights considerations into their climate policies, and also account for climate change when reporting on human rights performance.
While the failure to report on the linkages between human rights and climate change is not itself a violation of human rights obligations, it does suggest that many countries are not thinking about these obligations when formulating climate change plans and policies. It also makes it more difficult for the international community to assess what countries are doing to address the human rights implications of climate change.
3.2 Mitigation Measures and Commitments
The ""emissions gap""-- the gap between the aggregate effect of actions and commitments by parties to the UNFCCC and the emissions reductions required to keep warming at or below 2°C219--is a major concern from a human rights perspective. The parties have significantly increased their mitigation ambition in the lead-up to the Paris Agreement. But there is more to be done. Moreover, many countries dispute whether the 2°C is really adequate to prevent ""dangerous anthropogenic interference"" with the atmosphere and the natural systems that
support human life220--indeed, based on the IPCC's analysis (summarized in Part 1), an increase of this magnitude will have environmental impacts that seriously interfere with human rights for millions and perhaps even billions of people across the world.
In November 2015 UNEP published its sixth Emissions Gap Report which provides a scientific assessment of the mitigation contributions from submitted INDCs, and compares this with the mitigation levels required to meet the target of a global average temperature increase below 2°C by 2100.221 The assessment covers 119 submitted INDCs, representing 146 countries and 85-88 per cent of global emissions.
The assessment determined that full implementation of both unconditional and conditional INDCs will result in emission level estimates in 2030 that are most consistent with scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3-3.5°C with a greater than 66 per cent chance.222 Therefore although the INDCs do present a real increase in the ambition level compared to a projection of current policies, there is still a large emissions gap in 2030 of 12GtCO2e (with a range of 10-15).In light of these findings, there is a clear need to continue increasing ambition with respect to global GHG mitigation. Thus, many countries have called for inclusion of a mechanism for gradually ""ratcheting down"" emissions (or ""ramping up ambition"") in the upcoming Paris agreement.224 Such a mechanism could contribute to mitigation ambition, although it may not go far enough to protect human rights from climate-related harms. If emissions are not significantly lowered beneath the current commitments, there will almost certainly be environmental impacts that result in widespread interference with human rights. Indeed, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report confirmed that, to have a ""likely"" chance of limiting warming to 2°C, we must see ""substantial emissions reductions over the next few decades, and near zero emissions... by the end of the century.""225 Thus, national governments and other actors must seek pathways to a zero-carbon economy.
3.3 Adaptation Measures and Commitments
Considerable investments will be required in both developed and developing countries to adapt to climate change. Even the richest countries have yet to enact adequate legal and institutional frameworks for climate change adaptation, and will face serious challenges in terms of mobilizing resources and building adaptive capacity among their citizens, economic sectors, and infrastructure.226 But there is no question that developing countries--and in particular, least developed countries (LDCs) and geographically vulnerable countries (e.g., small island states)--face the greatest adaptation challenges.
In 2014, UNEP published the Global Adaptation Gap Report which found that there is likely to be a significant gap between the resources that would be needed to adapt to 2°C of warming and the funding that will be made available through international climate funds and other finance mechanisms.227 The report cited evidence that financial commitments to adaptation have increased in recent years, and that a significant amount of adaptation funding flows to developing countries.228 However, it also noted a serious need to scale up adaptation funding, and that the existing estimates of global adaptation costs (ranging from US$70 billion-$100 billion per year) are likely to be a significant underestimate, particularly in the period after 2030.229 The bulk of international climate finance to developing countries in the past few years has been channeled towards mitigation, rather than adaptation (see discussion below). In this context, the decision of the Green Climate Fund to allocate funds 50/50 between mitigation and adaptation is welcome.

The UNEP Global Adaptation Report also highlighted other key barriers to adaptation in developing countries, including lack of access to technologies and limitations in existing technologies, lack of knowledge about the impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of various adaptation measures, and problems with institutional capacity and governance in some countries. Even if countries increase their mitigation ambition and can limit warming to 2°C, it will be challenging for many countries to fulfill human rights obligations related to climate change adaptation.
3.4 Financial and Technical Assistance to Developing Countries
In the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed countries committed to a goal of mobilizing US$100 billion per year by 2020 to ""address the needs of developing countries"" in the context of ""meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation""230 The expectation was that this funding would come from a variety of public and private sources (not just foreign aid).231 This commitment was reaffirmed in the 2010 Cancun Agreements.232 The Cancun Agreements also called for the creation of a Green Climate Fund (GCF),233 with the stated objective of ""achieving a balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation.""234 The draft negotiating text for the Paris Agreement contains proposed text for scaling up finance after 2020, but does not specify a numeric target for this goal.As of October 2, 2015, a total of 37 governments had made pledges to the GCF, amounting to US$10.2 billion (including $5.8 billion in signed pledges, and $4.4 billion in announced but not signed pledges). 236 Thus, the aggregate amount of the pledges (which are not annual pledges), is far below the $100 billion annual target. Moreover, the countries have not yet made financial commitments or mobilized any resources for loss and damage caused by the effects of climate change.
However, a recent OECD report determined that many more funds have been mobilized outside of the context of the GCF.237 Specifically, the report concluded that developed countries had mobilized an average of US$57 billion per year in 2013-2014 for public and private climate finance in developing countries.238 This figure excludes the pledges that developed countries have made to the GCF. Notably, 77% of the mobilized climate finance addressed climate change mitigation only, 16% addressed adaptation only, and 7% consisted of activities designed to address both mitigation and adaptation.239 This data reinforces one key concern of developing countries-- that international climate finance will prioritize mitigation over adaptation--and lends support to the idea that climate finance should be channeled through a global facility, like the GCF, to ensure that funds are more equally distributed between adaptation and mitigation.
Even if the COP does meet its goal of mobilizing $100 billion in climate finance annually, this will not be adequate to address the effect of climate change on human rights. As noted by the World Resources Institute, $100 billion is ""only a fraction of the finance needed to keep the average temperature increase to 2°C,""240 and clearly insufficient to meet both adaptation and mitigation needs in developing countries.
On a more positive note, there are some promising examples of state action aimed at providing technical assistance to developing countries and addressing the transboundary impacts of climate change. For example, in October 2014, 110 countries endorsed the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda, which calls for additional research on international displacement caused by natural disasters, including climate-related disasters, and which directs countries to make better use of humanitarian measures to help those displaced across borders.
Nonetheless, to fulfill their human rights obligations relating to international cooperation and transboundary harm, developed countries should increase the amount of financial assistance that is provided to developing countries. They should also seek to achieve a more equitable balance between adaptation and mitigation funding, especially in light of current emissions trajectories.
3.5 Respect for Procedural Rights in Climate Policies and Planning
A complete overview of procedural safeguards for national adaptation and mitigation measures is beyond the scope of this report. But there are a few trends worth highlighting.
One of the most important developments occurred in 1992, when the UN General Assembly adopted the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Principle 10 stated that:
Environmental issues are best handled with participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities, including information on hazardous materials and activities in their communities, and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available. Effective access to judicial and administrative proceedings, including redress and remedy, shall be provided.The outcome document for Rio+20, The Future We Want, reaffirmed that ""broad public participation and access to information and judicial and administrative proceedings are essential to the promotion of sustainable development.""243 Countries across the world have taken important steps towards implementing these principles in environmental decision-making,244 and this seems to be the case for climate-related decisions as well.
For example, it appears that many countries are making reasonable efforts to assess the impacts of climate change, as well as the contribution of their activities to climate change, and make this information available to the public. This includes efforts to: (1) monitor and disclose domestic sources of GHG emissions, in accordance with Annex I of the UNFCCC; (2) inform the public about the potential impacts and risks associated with climate change; 245 (3) describe and evaluate efforts to respond to climate change;246 and (4) use existing EIA procedures to inform decision-makers and the public about the contribution of a proposed action to global GHG emissions, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on those proposals.It is difficult to gauge the extent to which governments are promoting public participation in decisions that involve climate change, for instance major projects that generate GHG emissions or the development of local, regional and national adaptation plans. National progress in this context relates to the broader issue of public participation in local, regional and national governance, and accordingly with general implementation of the rule of law in nations around the world. There is evidence that, as a general matter, many states have taken important steps towards promoting public participation in environmental decision-making.248 This appears to be the case for climate-related decisions as well. For example, one study found that many European countries have mechanisms in place to ensure that affected stakeholders are informed about climate-related decisions and that they can provide input on those decisions. 249 However, the same study found that government decision-makers should be more proactive about

soliciting input from affected stakeholders, and actually incorporating the information and perspectives gathered through public consultation processes into final decisions.Finally, perhaps the largest procedural gap in this context is the lack of access to justice and remedies for climaterelated harms. In both domestic courts and international tribunals, many cases alleging serious injury to human rights caused by the effects of climate change have been dismissed or have failed due to: (i) the challenge of establishing a causal link between specific emitters and climate change; (ii) the challenge of establishing a causal link between climate change and the on-the-ground impacts that gave rise to the harm; and/or (iii) the absence of legal requirements or liability for GHG emissions.251 Jurisdiction (or lack thereof) also poses a major barrier to judicial remedies, especially in the context of transboundary harms. Moreover, there is no international grievance mechanism that would provide an alternative forum for justice and remedies in this context--although many developing countries would like to see a Loss and Damage Framework developed under the auspices of the UNFCCC that could fill this role.One way for countries to implement and further elaborate upon their procedural human rights obligations is through participation in MEAs. As of 2015, there are 47 parties to the Aarhus Convention, which include virtually all of the countries in Europe as well as several countries in Central Asia.253 In addition, nineteen countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are currently negotiating a new regional agreement to implement the access rights set forth in Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration.254 Other actors are also using international mechanisms to give effect to procedural rights--for example, in 2010, the UNEP Governing Council adopted the Bali Guidelines for
the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, which are intended to be used as a guidance tool for states in the implementation of Rio Principle 10.3.6 Human Rights Safeguards in International Climate Finance Mechanisms
(a) Clean Development Mechanism
The CDM modalities and procedures include rules that require stakeholder consultation (LSC) and global stakeholder consultation (GSC) prior to the validation of a CDM project.256 These include rules directing the project participants and coordinating/managing entities to inform the public about the proposed CDM project, invite comments from local and global stakeholders, and explain how these comments were considered in the decision-making process.These rules are expressed in relatively general terms, lacking definite criteria for what constitutes adequate stakeholder consultation. Moreover, the rules do not require the consent of local stakeholders, nor do they outline any substantive requirements to promote the well-being of local people or the protection of rights (e.g., requirements for equitable distribution of project benefits). Nor is there any framework for prioritizing projects that will have beneficial impacts on the poor and other vulnerable groups, and their local environments.258 And although the project participants may include commitments to address stakeholder comments in the CDM project (e.g., commitments for job creation, mitigation of environmental harms, or compensation for land), there are no rules for monitoring the status or completion of those commitments. Finally, there are no provisions for stakeholders wishing to raise concerns about a project after it has been validated and registered, nor is there a grievance mechanism for individuals and communities who have been harmed by CDM projects.
As a result of these procedural deficiencies, Carbon Market Watch concluded that many CDM projects have been registered ""despite insufficient local stakeholder consultation, strong local opposition and clear evidence that projects cause harm to the local populations and/or ecosystems.""The Executive Board of the CDM has taken steps to improve stakeholder consultation for CDM projects. For example, at its seventieth meeting in 2012, the Board issued a decision directing Designated Operational Entities (DOEs) to assess whether LSC is still adequate when significant changes occur in the project design after the initial LSC.260 However, as noted in a recent concept note on improving stakeholder consultation in CDM projects, there are additional changes that could be made to the CDM rule and regulations ""to increase the participation of stakeholders in, and the transparency, clarity, and effectiveness of,"" the local and global stakeholder consultation processes.261 Recommendations for the CDM and other climate finance mechanisms are presented in Part 4.
The lack of adequate provisions for stakeholder consultation in this context reflects a failure on the part of governments to protect and promote both substantive and procedural human rights. As noted in section 1.2, there are some egregious examples of CDM projects that have resulted in the violation of human rights through displacement and the destruction of livelihoods. Better safeguards are needed to ensure that such violations do not occur in the context of future CDM projects.
(b) REDD+
The Cancun Agreements included a set of safeguards that serve as guidance for forest activities aimed at mitigating climate change.262 These included some provisions that are relevant to the protection of human rights--e.g., that projects should demonstrate ""respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities"" and that they should include the ""full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular
indigenous peoples and local communities.""263 But these guidelines are expressed in very general, non-binding terms, and they do not explicitly require consent from those who live in the forests or utilize the forest resources that will be affected by REDD+ projects. They also do not contain language about the equitable distribution of benefits from forestry projects, which may not be a human right in of itself, but which has implications for the effective enjoyment of human rights for those who live in forests and depend on forest resources.A variety of proposed standards and guidance documents have been introduced in this context. Two notable examples include the REDD+ Social & Environmental Standards,265 and the Joint Guidelines from UN-REDD Programme and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.266 These standards provide a more comprehensive framework for protecting the rights of indigenous peoples and other local stakeholders, and ensuring an equitable distribution of benefits from REDD+ projects, but they are not binding on member states or other project stakeholders.267 That said, projects that are funded through the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) are required to comply with World Bank safeguard policies.268 These include ten social and environmental safeguards addressing the following issues: (i) environmental assessment, (ii) natural habitats, (iii) pest management, (iv) physical and cultural resources, (v) involuntary settlement, (vi), indigenous peoples, (vii) forests; (viii) dam safety; (ix) projects on international waterways; and (x) projects in disputed areas.269 However, compliance with the World Bank safeguards may not ensure that rights will be respected, because the existing safeguards arguably do not fully reflect existing human rights obligations, such as the obligation to obtain free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) for projects that adversely affect indigenous peoples.270 The World Bank is currently working on revisions to the safeguard policies, which may result in positive human rights outcomes--for example, the current draft requires FPIC for projects that affect indigenous lands and resources or result in the displacement of indigenous communities.271 However, some stakeholders are concerned that the revisions will ultimately weaken protections for affected communities and the environment, as a result of roll backs in due diligence and other procedural requirements.Ultimately, to fulfill obligations to protect and promote human rights, countries should ensure that any REDD+ projects financed within their jurisdiction include adequate public participation mechanisms and that they do not result in the dispossession of people from forest lands and resources. Special attention should be paid to the rights of indigenous people in this context, and in particular, the right to FPIC. The COP should also consider adopting a more concrete safeguard policy that applies to all REDD+ projects.
(c) Green Climate Fund
In 2014, the GCF Board decided to adopt, on an interim basis, the International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) environmental and social performance standards for GCF-funded projects.273 The IFC safeguards include eight performance standards addressing the following issues: (i) Assessment and management of social and environmental risks and impacts; (ii) Labor and working conditions; (iii) Resource efficiency and pollution prevention; (iv) Community health; (v) Safety and security; (vi) Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement; (vii) Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources; (viii) Full respect of rights of indigenous people and protection of cultural heritage. The Board also adopted terms of reference for an ""Independent Redress Mechanism"" to receive complaints related to the operation of the Fund and make operation.274 Once operational, peoples and communities who are directly affected by adverse impacts of projects resulting from a failure to implement the IFC safeguards can submit a complaint to the mechanism. The mechanism can make recommendations on a specific project or on operational policies and procedures.
Bwindi Forest National Park, Uganda
The IFC standards appear to provide adequate protection for human rights--for example, they specify that, in the context of land acquisition projects, project proponents should ""avoid/minimize displacement,"" ""avoid forced eviction,"" and ""improve or restore livelihoods and standards of living.""275 They also require FPIC for indigenous peoples under specified circumstances.276 These substantive provisions are complemented by the procedural mechanisms noted above.
Thus, the safeguards provided for the GCF appear to be sufficient for the protection and promotion of both procedural and substantive human rights, and should be adopted as permanent guidelines, ideally with additional provisions on internal monitoring and assessment.
(d) Adaptation Fund
The Adaptation Fund Board approved an Environmental and Social Policy in November 2013.277 The policy outlines a process for screening projects and programs based on their environmental and social impacts, and adopting measures to mitigate any adverse impacts. Specifically, the policy requires implementing entities to adopt measures to avoid or, where avoidance is impossible, minimize environmental and social risks, and monitor and report on the status of those measures during and at the end of implementation. It also outlines a set of social principles to guide the impact assessment process, which are more comprehensive than some of the other safeguard policies. Some notable aspects of these principles include:
· They explicitly require that all projects supported by the Fund ""respect and where applicable promote human rights,""278 and furthermore, that all projects adhere to ""core labour standards as identified
by the International Labour Organization""279 and the ""rights and responsibilities set forth in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other applicable international instruments relating to indigenous peoples."" · They require that projects be designed and implemented in a way that ""avoids or minimizes the need for involuntary resettlement"" and specify requirements for when ""limited involuntary settlement is unavoidable"" which include ""socially feasible resettlement alternatives or fair and adequate compensation.""
· They require that all supported projects ""provide fair and equitable access to benefits in a manner that is inclusive and does not impede access to basic health services, clean water and sanitation, energy, education, housing, safe and decent working conditions, and land rights,"" and that projects ""should not exacerbate existing inequities, particularly with respect to marginalized or vulnerable groups.""281 They also include specific provisions to ensure that project proponents respect the rights of marginalized and vulnerable groups and women.· They include provisions for habitat protection, conservation of biological diversity, pollution prevention, resource efficiency, public health, physical and cultural heritage, and land and soil conservation.The policy also includes relatively robust requirements for public disclosure and consultation, and for monitoring, reporting, and evaluating the implementation of projects and risk mitigation measures.284 Finally the policy requires that the implementing entities identify a grievance mechanism that will provide affected persons with an ""accessible, transparent, fair and effective process for receiving and addressing their complaints about environmental or social harms"" caused by the project, and also allows for complaints to be submitted to the Adaptation Fund Board secretariat.Thus, like the Green Climate Fund, these safeguards appear to be sufficient for the protection and promotion of both substantive and procedural human rights.
(e) Global Environment Facility
The GEF is the oldest UNFCCC financial mechanism, and it manages two additional funds established by the COP: the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and the Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF). In 2011, the GEF Council has also approved its own set of Policies on Environmental and Social Safeguards and Gender Mainstreaming.286 The environmental and social safeguards are similar to the World Bank safeguards.287 They require an initial screening for environmental and social impacts, and outline various substantive requirements for the protection of natural habitats, avoiding and minimizing involuntary resettlement, protecting the rights of indigenous peoples (but unlike the World bank, they require FPIC), pest management, the protection of physical cultural resources, and dam safety. Apart from the requirements for consulting with and respecting the rights of indigenous peoples, the public participation provisions are very weak. The social and environmental policy also lacks provisions to address adverse or disproportionate impacts on vulnerable or marginalized groups.
The policy on gender mainstreaming outlines additional criteria for soliciting input from women and avoiding discriminatory outcomes. The policy calls for the preparation of a ""gender mainstreaming strategy or plan"" to ""cover gender sensitive activities"" but does not contain very robust requirements for ensuring that women are fully involved in the decision-making process and that benefits are equally distributed to women.The GEF safeguards provide some protection for human rights, but additional provisions on public notice and consultation would help to ensure that procedural rights are fully respected in the context of GEF-funded projects.

Recommendations
Based on the following summary of human rights obligations and implementation, this report makes the following recommendations on how the UNFCCC Parties and other actors can better integrate human rights considerations into their mitigation and adaptation activities.
4.1 International Cooperation
More Ambitious Mitigation Targets ­ Even if all of the INDCs are fully implemented, the anticipated level of global warming will result in extreme climatic and environmental impacts and widespread adverse effects on human rights. The Parties should continue to increase their mitigation ambition so as to ensure that the global average temperature increase remains at or below 2.0°C, and preferably 1.5°C. To this end, the Paris agreement should include a schedule for assessing and revisiting country commitments with the aim of increasing, over time, the ambition of the climate targets set by countries. Another way to encourage more ambition would be to establish scientifically-based targets for all countries and then assess the performance of countries with respect to these targets. The targets could account for countries' historical and current GHG emissions (on a countrywide, per capita, and per unit of GDP basis) as well as the financial and technical capacity of the country to make emissions reductions. Nations should also undertake efforts to reduce emissions above and beyond their international commitments.
Recognize the Link Between Climate Change and Human Rights in the Paris Agreement: The COP should expressly refer to both the effects of climate change on the exercise of human rights and the need for Parties to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill human rights in all climate-related activities. This could include: (i) recognizing the human rights-climate change nexus in the preamble to the agreement; (ii) noting that one purpose of the agreement is to protect, respect, and fulfill the human rights of all persons; (iii) calling for mitigation commitments that are sufficient to fully protect human rights; (iv) calling upon the parties to ensure that all mitigation and adaptation activities do not violate human rights; and (v) incorporating more robust human rights safeguards into climate finance mechanisms.


RECOMMENDATIONS

Human Rights Safeguards for International Climate Finance Mechanisms ­ The safeguards for the various climate funds and other mechanisms used to finance mitigation and adaptation projects should be made uniform and revised to fully account for human rights considerations. The Adaptation Fund policy provides a good model, although it would be useful to flesh out many of the provisions in that policy with more detailed guidance. In particular, these safeguards should specify procedural requirements as well as substantive requirements--e.g., ""no harm"" rules to ensure that projects do not adversely affect local communities. One way to achieve this would be to establish a social and environmental safeguard policy that applies to all UNFCCC mechanisms and funds, accompanied by a more detailed implementation guide.
Financial Assistance to Developing Countries ­ It is imperative that developed countries increase financial assistance to developing countries, and in particular, the LDCs and countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In particular, the amount of funding available for adaptation measures in these countries should be significantly increased in order to account for the disproportionate adverse effects of climate change on people, settlements, and ecosystems. The $100 billion goal should not be viewed as an overarching goal for all climate finance in developed countries, as it is inadequate even to cover the cost of mitigation measures (let alone adaptation measures). Rather, separate funding targets should be established for adaptation measures.
Climate Displacement and Migration ­ Climate change could contribute to the temporary displacement and permanent migration of millions of people in the coming decades. Countries should cooperate in the development of an international mechanism for addressing climate-induced displacement and migration, both within and across domestic borders. Proposals have already been made for the creation of ""Climate Change Displacement Coordination Facility"" within the UNFCCC, and countries should consider supporting the development of such a facility.Loss and Damage ­ Countries should also continue to discuss the broader issue of loss and damage in a transparent way that will address the concerns of all affected countries. This could occur within the framework of the existing Warsaw Mechanism, or a new platform could be developed (most likely within the UNFCCC). Additional stakeholders--such as the UN human rights agencies and expert bodies--could be included in this dialogue.
New Mechanisms for International Coordination and Accountability ­ To facilitate the activities noted above and other rights-related goals, it may be desirable to introduce new mechanisms for sharing information, coordinating responses, and promoting accountability. Some examples might include:
· Work Programme on Human Rights ­ The COP could establish a work program on human rights, pursuant to the recommendation of the Special Procedures mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council.290 This work programme could compile data, conduct research, evaluate progress, and develop recommendations on how human rights can be better integrated into climate change responses.
· Information Sharing Platform ­ Alternatively, or as a complement to a UNFCCC work program, the COP and/or another UN body could introduce a platform for compiling and sharing information and best practices--e.g., examples of successful mitigation and adaptation measures with human rights co-benefits, national and sub-national policies that are particularly mindful of human rights, and costeffective strategies for improving public participation in climate-related decision-making.
· Human Rights Accountability ­ The COP or another UN body could establish an independent accountability mechanism to evaluate human rights performance in the context of climate-related actions taken by countries and private actors. The UNHCR could also issue a declaration or guidance document calling upon countries to incorporate climate-related considerations into their UPR reports.

Continued Focus on Environmental Protection and Conservation ­ A continued focus on environmental protection and conservation will be necessary to address the potential effects of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources. As such, governmental and private actors should remain dedicated to these goals--for example, through the ongoing and enhanced implementation of MEAs, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.
4.2 National Measures
National Mitigation ­ Regardless of what happens within the UNFCCC, countries should continue to pursue domestic GHG reductions to the greatest extent practicable and with a target of achieving a net zero carbon economy, as this will be necessary to safeguard the human rights of persons both within and outside of their territory.
National Adaptation Planning ­ Countries should consider how to align human rights and climate change adaptation objectives. One approach would be to pursue an integrated response to climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, in order to better safeguard human rights in the face of climate-related disasters. National planners should also pursue adaptation measures with environmental and social co-benefits, such as ecosystem-based adaptation, which refers to the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of natural ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. Decision-makers can refer to UNEP's Ecosystem-Based Adaptation Guidance for additional information on this approach.291 Finally, countries must ensure that they do not discriminate against marginalized groups in all adaptation planning activities and in responses to climate-related hazards and disasters.
National Adoption of Human Rights Protections ­ Countries should incorporate human rights norms into their domestic legal frameworks, including (but not limited to) laws that specifically address climate change. This could include, for example, specific provisions to ensure that the affected public has knowledge of and an adequate opportunity to comment on proposals for domestic mitigation and adaptation policies. In developing domestic policies, countries can consult with existing MEAs, the Bali Guidelines Bali Guidelines for the Development of National Legislation on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, and a Compilation of Good Practices published earlier this year by the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Environment,292 among other resources.
4.3 Local Governments and Private Actors
Local Governments ­ Local governments should undertake measures to reduce GHG emissions within their jurisdiction and pursue adaptation objectives in a manner that is mindful of human rights. As with national governments, local governments should ensure that adaptation responses are non-discriminatory, consider integrating climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction programs, and pursue adaptation measures with environmental and social co-benefits, such as ecosystem-based adaptation.
Private Sector - Private actors also have important roles to play in addressing climate change and protecting human rights. They can place pressure on national governments to adopt more ambitious policies and cooperate in international negotiations, and can also undertake their own initiatives to reduce their carbon foot print and ensure that they respect human rights in all of their activities. In particular, large businesses should adopt policies that correspond with the recommendations set forth in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

Conclusion
Climate change and responses to climate change will have a profound effect on the exercise of human rights for millions and perhaps billions of people across the world. This will occur through both direct impacts on humans and settlements, as well as through the degradation of the ecosystems and environmental resources upon which many lives and livelihoods depend. States have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, and this includes obligations to mitigate domestic GHG emissions, protect citizens against the harmful effects of climate change, and ensure that responses to climate change do not result in human rights violations. Although states have taken important steps towards fulfilling these obligations, there is more to be done. In particular, states need to increase their ambition with respect to both climate change mitigation and adaptation, and work cooperatively to ensure the protection of human rights for all citizens across the world.

Glossary

This glossary is compiled according to the Lead Authors of the report drawing on glossaries and other resources available on the websites of the following organizations, networks and projects: Center for International Forestry Research, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and World Resources Institute.
Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.
Additionality: A criterion sometimes applied to projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions. It stipulates that the emission reductions accomplished by the project must not have happened anyway had the project not taken place.
Afforestation: Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests.
Agriculture, forestry and other land use: AFOLU plays a central role for food security and sustainable development. The main mitigation options within AFOLU involve one or more of three strategies: prevention of emissions to the atmosphere by conserving existing carbon pools in soils or vegetation or by reducing emissions of methane and nitrous oxide; sequestration--increasing the size of existing carbon pools and thereby extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere; and substitution--substituting biological products for fossil fuels or energy-intensive products, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. Demand-side measures (for example, reducing losses and wastes of food, changes in human diet, or changes in wood consumption) may also play a role. FOLU (Forestry and Other Land Use)--also referred to as LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry)--is the subset of AFOLU emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change, and forestry activities excluding agricultural emissions.

Annex I Parties: The industrialized countries listed in Annex I to the Convention, which committed to returning their GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 as per Article 4.2(a) and (b). They have also accepted emission targets for the period 2008-12 as per Article 3 and Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. They include the 24 original OECD members, the European Union, and 14 countries with economies in transition (Croatia, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Slovenia joined Annex I at COP 3, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia replaced Czechoslovakia). See also Non-Annex I Parties.
Annex II Parties: The countries listed in Annex II to the Convention which have a special obligation to provide financial resources and facilitate technology transfer to developing countries. Annex II Parties include the 24 original OECD members plus the European Union.
Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of transformation pathways, the term `baseline scenarios' refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for GHG emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term `baseline scenario' is used interchangeably with `reference scenario' and `no policy scenario'. In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term `business-as-usual (BAU) scenario', although the term `BAU' has fallen out of favour because the idea of `business-as-usual' in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom.
Biomass: The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume, including products, by-products, and waste of biological origin (plants or animal matter) and excluding material embedded in geological formations and transformed to fossil fuels or peat.

The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ Glossary vii

Biomass plus carbon capture and storage (BioCCS or BECCS): Use of energy produced from biomass where the combustion gases are then captured and stored underground or used, for example, in industrial processes. It excludes gases generated through, for example, a fermentation process (as opposed to combustion).
Black carbon: The substance formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass, which is emitted in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. It consists of pure carbon in several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo ­ the ability to reflect sunlight ­ when deposited on snow and ice.

Carbon dioxide equivalent: A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHGs, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, GHG emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of GHG listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents assuming a 100-year global warming potential.
Carbon intensity: The amount of emissions of carbon dioxide released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic product (GDP), output energy use or transport.

Bottom-up model: In the context of this assessment, a model that represents a system by looking at its detailed underlying parts. Compared to so-called top-down models, which focus on economic interlinkages, bottom-up models of energy use and emissions can provide greater resolution with regards to sectors or mitigation technologies.
Business-as-usual: A scenario that describes future GHG emission levels in the absence of additional mitigation efforts and policies (with respect to an agreed set). In the 2014 EGR (page 5, para 2), BAU scenarios were based on an extrapolation of current economic, social and technological trends. They only took into account climate policies implemented up to around 2005-10 (that is, more recent country pledges and policies were not considered) and therefore served as a reference point for what would happen to emissions if planned climate mitigation policies were not implemented. See Baseline/reference.
Bunker fuels: A term used to refer to fuels consumed for international marine and air transport.
Cancun pledge: During 2010, many countries submitted their existing plans for controlling GHG emissions to the Climate Change Secretariat and these proposals were formally acknowledged under the UNFCCC. Developed countries presented their plans in the shape of economy-wide targets to reduce emissions, mainly up to 2020, while developing countries proposed ways to limit their growth of emissions in the shape of plans of action.
Carbon credits: An entitlement allocated by a government to a legal entity (company or other type of emitter) to emit a specified amount of a substance. These entitlements, which may be transferrable and tradable, can be used to reduce emissions of GHGs (by giving them a monetary value) or can be used for accounting of emissions.
Carbon dioxide emission budget: For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5°C or 2°C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted to stay within that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a GHG emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise.

Carbon market: A popular (but misleading) term for a trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of GHG emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or under other agreements, such as that among member states of the European Union. The term comes from the fact that CO2 is the predominant GHG, and other gases are measured in units called `CO2 equivalents'.
Carbon offset: See Offset.
Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2-equivalent emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies.
Carbon sequestration: The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir.
Carbon sink: A pool (reservoir) that removes carbon from the active part of the carbon cycle.
Carbon stock: The quantity of carbon contained in a carbon pool.
Carbon tax: A levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon dioxide, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions.
Co-benefits: The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on, among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. Co-benefits are often referred to as ancillary benefits.
Conditional INDCs: INDCs proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors.

viii The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ Glossary

Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the Convention. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention's progress.
Current policy trajectory: This trajectory is based on estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches including policies at least through 2012. Estimates may be based on either official data or independent analysis.
Decarbonization: The process by which countries or other entities aim to achieve a low-carbon economy, or by which individuals aim to reduce their carbon consumption.
Deforestation: The direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non-forested land (Marrakesh Accords). The conversion of forest to another land use or the long-term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the minimum 10 per cent threshold.
Degradation (forest): Changes within the forest that negatively affect the structure or function of the forest stand or site, and thereby lower its capacity to supply products and services.
Delayed-action scenarios: See Later-action scenarios.
Double counting: In the context of this assessment, double counting refers to a situation in which the same emission reductions are counted towards meeting two countries' pledges.
Emissions gap: The difference between the GHG emission levels consistent with having a likely chance (>66 per cent) of limiting the mean global temperature rise to below 2°C or 1.5°C in 2100 above pre-industrial levels and the GHG emission levels consistent with the global effect of the INDCs, assuming full implementation from 2020.
Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual GHG emissions over time.
Forest: Land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 m and a canopy cover of more than 10 per cent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.
Forest landscape restoration: A process which aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human wellbeing in deforested or degraded forest landscapes to meet present and future needs and accommodate multiple uses over time.
Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times GHGs remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation.
Greenhouse gases (GHGs): The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

Grid parity: This occurs when an alternative energy source can generate power at a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid.
Gross domestic product (GDP): The sum of gross value added, at purchasers' prices, by all resident and non-resident producers in the economy, plus any taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of products in a country or geographic region for a given period, normally one year. GDP is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources.
`Hot air': Refers to the concern that some governments will be able to meet their targets for GHG emissions under any formal agreement with minimal effort and could then flood the market with emission credits, reducing the incentive for other countries to cut their own domestic emissions.
Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of GHGs to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes.
Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC): Submissions by Parties which identify actions each national government intends to take under the future UNFCCC climate agreement, due to be negotiated in Paris in December 2015. INDCs are, in effect, the basis of post-2020 global emission reduction commitments that will be included in the future climate agreement.
International cooperative initiatives (ICIs): Initiatives outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at reducing emissions of climate forcers by, for example, promoting actions that are less GHG intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Cooperative initiatives also involve national and sub-national partners (they are often referred to as, simply, `cooperative initiatives').
Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of GHG emissions by industrialized countries.
Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A GHG inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities.
Later-action scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios in which emission levels in the near term, typically up to 2020 or 2030, are higher than those in the corresponding least-cost scenarios.
Leakage: That portion of cuts in GHG emissions by developed countries ­ countries trying to meet mandatory limits under

The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ Glossary ix

the Kyoto Protocol ­ that may reappear in other countries not bound by such limits. For example, multinational corporations may shift factories from developed to developing countries to escape restrictions on emissions.
Least-cost scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios assuming that emission reductions start immediately after the model base year, and are distributed optimally over time, sectors and regions, such that aggregate costs of reaching the climate target are minimized.
Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent chance. Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits.
Lock-in: Lock-in occurs when a market is stuck with a standard even though participants would be better off with an alternative.
Medium chance: A likelihood of 50­66 per cent chance. Used in this report to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits.

investors. More broadly, non-state actors have been defined as entities that participate or act in international relations. They are organizations with sufficient power to influence and cause a change even though they do not belong to any state institution.
Offset (in climate policy): A unit of CO2-equivalent emissions that is reduced, avoided, or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere.
Party: A state (or regional economic integration organization such as the EU) that agrees to be bound by a treaty and for which the treaty has entered into force.
Pledge case: This case identifies the maximum level of GHG emissions that each country or Party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge ­ without considering the use of offsets.
Readiness: REDD+ country actions ­ including capacity building, policy design, consultation and consensus building, and testing and evaluation of a REDD+ national strategy ­ that are taken prior to the comprehensive implementation of REDD+.

Mitigation: In the context of climate change, a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of GHGs. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other `sinks' to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Monitoring, reporting and verification: A process/concept that potentially supports greater transparency in the climate change regime.

REDD+: Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries.
Reference scenario: See Baseline/reference.
Reforestation: Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that have been converted to some other use.

Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the Earth's ozone layer.
Mosaic restoration: This integrates trees into mixed-use landscapes, such as agricultural lands and settlements, where trees can support people through improved water quality, increased soil fertility, and other ecosystem services. This type of restoration is more likely in deforested or degraded forest landscapes with moderate population density (10-100 people/km2).
Net negative emissions: A situation of net negative emissions is achieved when, as a result of human activities, more GHGs are sequestered or stored than are released into the atmosphere.

Rehabilitation (forest): Restoration of the capacity of degraded forest land to deliver forest products and services. Forest rehabilitation re-establishes the original productivity of the forest and some, but not necessarily all, of the plant and animal species thought to be originally present at a site.
Restoration forest: Restoration of a degraded forest to its original state ­ that is, to re-establish the presumed structure, productivity and species diversity of the forest originally present at a site.
Results-based payments: Payments for fully measured, reported and verified emission reductions (or removals), also conditional upon the country having a national strategy/action plan for REDD+, a national forest monitoring system, national forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level, a safeguard information system and a summary of information on how safeguards have been addressed and respected.

No-policy scenario: See Baseline/reference.
Non-Annex I Parties: The countries that have ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC that are not included in Annex I of the Convention.

Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on `if-then' propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables.

Non-state actor: In the context of climate action, `non-state Sink: Any process, activity or mechanism which removes actor' includes companies, cities, subnational regions and a GHG, an aerosol or a precursor of a GHG from the

atmosphere. Forests and other vegetation are considered sinks because they remove CO2 through photosynthesis.
Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a GHG, an aerosol or a precursor of a GHG or aerosol into the atmosphere.
Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
Technology transfer: A broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change among different stakeholders.
Temperature overshoot: An emission pathway that temporarily exceeds target temperature limits (2°C or 1.5°C) before falling below the limits again by 2100 with a given percentage chance.
Tipping point: A level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the climate system, it refers to a critical threshold when global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state. The tipping point event may be irreversible.
Top-down model: A model that applies macroeconomic theory, econometric and/or optimization techniques to aggregate economic variables. Using historical data on consumption, prices, incomes, and factor costs, topdown models assess demand and emissions for goods and services from main sectors, such as energy conversion, transportation, buildings, agriculture and industry.

Transient climate response: Measure of the temperature rise that occurs at the time of a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.
Transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions: Measure of temperature rise per unit of cumulative carbon emissions.
Uncertainty: A cognitive state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (for example a probability density function) or by qualitative statements (for example reflecting the judgement of a team of experts).
Unconditional INDCs: INDCs proposed by countries without conditions attached.
Wide-scale restoration: Aims to restore closed forests to the landscape. This type of restoration is more likely in deforested or degraded landscapes with low population density (<10 people/km2) that are also areas where closed forests formerly dominated the landscape.
2020 pledge: See Cancun pledge.
20th­80th percentile range: Results that fall within the 20­80 per cent range of the frequency distribution of results in this assessment.

Foreword

Following the historic signing of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, this sixth edition of the UNEP Emissions Gap Report comes as world leaders start gathering in Paris to establish a new agreement on climate change.
The report offers an independent assessment of the mitigation contributions from the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) committed to by 1 October 2015, by the 146 countries that account for around 90 per cent of global emissions. It compares the 2030 emission levels that would result from these commitments with what science tells us would keep average temperature increases on track to stay below 2°C by the end of the century; it provides data for an aspirational target of keeping that increase below 1.5°C; and it evaluates the INDCs in relation to progress on the 2020 pledges made in Cancun.
The INDCs demonstrate a significant increase in ambition and their successful delivery could reduce emissions by around 25 per cent compared to the level expected from current policies and pledges. However, this would still put long-term temperatures on track for an increase and lead to serious climate impact, so more action is required.

With many new emission reduction initiatives also generating substantial economic, social and environmental benefits, the INDC preparation process in most countries encouraged greater exploration of the links between development and climate. This is an important first step in a possible transition towards more low carbon economies.
The Emissions Gap Report makes it very clear that while reaching a meaningful global agreement in Paris is essential, it is not the end of the climate change story: it is a stepping stone on a much longer journey that requires us to stay alert to the science and remain dynamic in our response. The world has already tripled the expected performance on scaling up clean energy and been able to start reversing damage to the ozone layer.
I firmly believe that if we act on the findings of this report, there is nothing to stop us closing the emissions gap and creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for both the developed and the developing world.

Therefore, the Emissions Gap Report also explores how available financial, technical and capacity building solutions can be scaled up, or even accelerated, to close the gap between the expected and required levels of emissions. This includes detailed assessments that look beyond the INDCs to identify the further gains being identified by the International Cooperative Initiatives and by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).

Executive Summary

The year 2015 has the potential to become a turning point in global efforts to transform the prevailing social and economic development paradigm into a more sustainable one.
The global community reached agreement in September 2015 on a set of 17 sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030, including climate change. Countries will meet again at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris with the aim of establishing a new global agreement on climate change, hereafter the `Paris Agreement', with the ambition of limiting changes in global temperatures to below 2°C or 1.5°C warming in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement will also aim to establish a framework to provide technological and financial support for developing countries to accelerate the transition towards low carbon and climate resilient development paths.
The architecture of a new climate agreement has many facets with an array of issues under negotiation that have become significantly more complex since the Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 1994. The core structure of the Paris Agreement will comprise the ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"" (INDCs) as well as the process by which implementation of the agreement will proceed over time to advance the objectives of the UNFCCC. In addition, a number of key decisions will be required covering issues like adaptation, finance, technology, and capacity building.
1. What is covered in the 2015 Emissions Gap Report?
This sixth UNEP Emissions Gap Report provides a scientific assessment of the mitigation contributions from the submitted INDCs. As in the previous reports, it then compares the resulting emission levels in 2030 with what science tells us is required to be on track towards the agreed target of a global average temperature increase below 2°C

by 2100. The Report also provides data for the aspirational target of keeping the temperature increase below 1.5°C. In addition, the Report presents selected areas where enhanced action can be taken, accelerated and scaled up to close the emissions gap.
The 2015 Emissions Gap Report addresses the following key questions:
· What are the latest estimates of 2025 and 2030 total global emissions levels consistent with the goal of holding the global average temperature rise below 2°C or 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100?
· What is the progress on implementation of the Cancun pledges for the period to 2020?
· Will the combined INDC commitments for 2030 (if fully implemented) be sufficient to stay within the range consistent with the 2°C temperature goal?
· What are possible contributions in selected key areas, where action can be accelerated to enhance the ambition of national pledges both in the period before and after the expected entry into force in 2020 of the Paris Agreement? This year the detailed assessment is on possible mitigation contributions from International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) and enhanced forest-related mitigation activities with a focus on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
By 1 October 2015, a total of 119 INDCs had been submitted to the UNFCCC. Fifteen INDCs included only mitigation, while most included both adaptation and mitigation components. The report only presents qualitative information about the adaptation component of the INDCs submitted.
The report has been prepared by an international team of leading scientists assessing all available information, including that reviewed by the IPCC in its fifth assessment report, as well as more recent scientific studies. The assessment production process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to governments and stakeholders concerned during relevant international fora as well as on the UNEP Live website. The governments of the countries with specific mention in the report have been invited to comment on the assessment findings.
2. What are current emissions and what emission levels in 2030 are consistent with the 2°C and the 1.5°C targets?
Over the past decades global GHG emissions have been increasing steadily, with small variations around a longerterm trend.
The most recent global emission estimates1 are available for the year 2014. In that year, total global Kyoto-GHG emissions2 amounted to about 52.7 GtCO2e (range: 47.9-57.5). Global

carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fuel and industry were estimated at 35.5 GtCO2 for 2014 (range: 32.5-38.5).
Staying below 2°C temperature rise implies that CO2 emissions are reduced to net zero by 2060-2075.
The IPCC in its fifth assessment report concluded that to limit global warming to below 2°C, the remaining cumulative CO2 emissions ­ the so-called carbon budget ­ are in the order of 1 000 GtCO2. This remaining budget can be utilized in different ways, but given the most recent assessment of current trends, net global carbon emissions will eventually need to be reduced to zero between 2060 and 20753. For a detailed discussion of the carbon budget, see the 2014 Emissions Gap Report.

The 2015 Report presents an updated set of possible pathways to stay within this budget, and also includes an updated assessment of the pathways and requirements to stay within the more ambitious 1.5°C temperature goal.
The median emission level in 2030 in scenarios that have a >66 per cent chance of keeping temperature increase to below 2°C by the end of the century is 42 GtCO2e (range: 31-44). The similar level for a 1.5°C pathway is 39 GtCO2e4. The trajectories for the two target levels are similar in many aspects, but earlier and much stronger action is necessary for the 1.5°C target to be kept.
As reflected in last year's report, the focus for the gap assessment has shifted from 2020 to 2030, reflecting that the underlying scenarios assume emission levels that are consistent with the Cancun pledges until 2020. Least-cost enhanced emission reduction pathways are only assumed from 2020. Earlier analysis assumed the world would move onto a least-cost pathway by 2010. Current trends indicate that this will not be the case, and accordingly the new set of scenarios from the IPCC, which are referenced in this report, include only those that assume least-cost pathways starting from 2020.
3. What are the implications of the scenarios that are consistent with the temperature goals?
The scenarios used in this Report as reference for meeting the 2°C and 1.5°C goals are all characterized by modest emissions reductions compared to current policies until 20205 that are in line with the ambition of Cancun pledges. This implies a need for deep and stringent emission reductions over later decades. Enhanced action before 2020 that would bring emission levels below the projected 2020 Cancun pledge level would ease the challenge and reduce overall cost of transitioning to least-cost pathways after 2020. It should be noted that in order to move to such pathways after 2020, the necessary policies and investment will need to be prepared well in advance.
The assessment of the pathways and target levels point at three key issues that have also been raised in previous gap reports:
· All scenarios analyzing 2°C pathways that follow the Cancun pledges until 2020 and with a least-cost starting point in 2020, require strong reductions after 2020. They also rely on so-called `negative emission technologies' such as bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage
· For scenarios analyzing the 1.5°C target, the reduction rates will need to be steeper
· The feasibility of large scale deployment of negative emission technologies is still a contentious issue.
4 As there are fewer than 10 scenarios available for the 1.5°C pathways, the 20th to 80th percentile range is not provided. However, the minimum and maximum values are 37 GtCO2e and 40 GtCO2e respectively.
5 Global emissions in 2020 under various pledge cases are estimated to be about 52-54 GtCO2e. The least-cost 2020 scenarios used here have global emissions close to this range (49-56 GtCO2e).

Enhanced early action (such as moving below the 2020 pledges) is associated with the following economic and technological advantages:
· Softening the requirement for very steep emission reductions over the medium term
· Facilitating mitigation in the medium to long term by reducing lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society as a whole
· Encouraging near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term
· Providing early policy signals which are needed for action later in the coming decades
· Reducing the overall costs and economic challenges in terms of, for example, upscaling of energy investments, during the transitional period
· Reducing the dependence on unproven technologies and increase the options society can choose from in terms of means to achieve stringent emission reductions in the long term.
Delaying stringent mitigation efforts until 2030 (in other words, not following a least-cost reduction trajectory after 2020) would with high confidence make the transition to longer-term emissions levels in line with the 2°C goal significantly more difficult. A significant number of models are not able to produce 2°C scenarios consistent with global emission levels in 2030 above 55 GtCO2e, while other scenarios which delay enhanced mitigation action until after 2030 would imply massive cost increases coupled with a need for unprecedented political action.
4. Are G20 countries making progress on the implementation of 2020 pledges?
Among the G20 there are thirteen countries with pledges for 2020 (counting the EU members France, Germany, Italy and UK as one) and three countries without pledges. Six of these are assessed as being on track to meet pledges or extremely close, four are not, and three cannot be assessed, because there is insufficient evidence.
Pledges are self-determined. A country being on track does not necessarily mean that it undertakes more stringent action on mitigation than a country that is not on track ­ it depends on the ambition of the pledge.
The report presents an assessment of progress by G20 countries on the national pledges presented in the context of the Cancun agreement, and referred to here as the Cancun pledges.
The assessment compares projected 2020 emissions under three cases:
· Pledge case ­ projecting the maximum amount of emissions for 2020 compatible with the pledge
· Current policy trajectory ­ official national estimate · Current policy trajectory ­ independent analysis.
Despite progress towards implementing policies in line with pledges, it is evident that work remains to be done to bring all G20 countries into pledge attainment.

5. What is the emissions gap in 2025 and

combination of global and country-specific modelling studies

2030 assuming full implementation of the from independent research teams, and official country-

INDCs?

specific data sources.

The emissions gap between what the full implementation of the unconditional INDCs contribute and the least-cost emission level for a pathway to stay below 2°C, is estimated to be 14 GtCO2e (range: 12-17) in 2030 and 7 GtCO2e (range: 5-10) in 2025. When conditional INDCs are included as fully implemented, the emissions gap in 2030 is estimated to be 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15) and 5 GtCO2e (range: 4-8) in 2025.
If countries that have not yet submitted an INDC were to reduce their emissions at the same percentage below current policy trajectories as those that have already submitted, the projected global emissions would be further reduced, and the gap narrowed, by a further 0.5 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1 GtCO2e in 2030.
Full implementation of unconditional INDC results in emission level estimates in 2030 that are most consistent with scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3.5°C until 2100 with a greater than 66 per cent chance. INDC estimates do, however, come with uncertainty ranges. When taking this into account the 3.5°C value could decrease to 3°C or increase towards 4°C for the low and high unconditional INDC estimates, respectively. When including the full implementation of conditional INDCs, the emissions level estimates become most consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to <3-3.5°C by the end of the century with a greater than 66 per cent chance.
These numbers essentially tell two stories. Firstly the INDCs do present a real increase in the ambition level compared to a projection of current policies; all global modelling groups that have been assessed reached this conclusion. Secondly the submitted contributions are far from enough and the emissions gap in both 2025 and 2030 will be very significant.
The Report presents an assessment of the 119 INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015, covering 146 countries and 85-88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012. A final update of the assessment including later submissions will be presented on the UNEP Live website before the start of COP 21.
In the absence of agreed formats for reporting on mitigation contributions, including on the units in which those might be expressed, Parties have chosen a wide variety of forms and contributions: for example, targets used include:
· Economy-wide absolute reduction from historical base year emissions
· Emissions reduction relative to a baseline projection for the emissions associated with energy consumption
· Trajectory target for specific sectors or gases · Specifying a peaking year · Emissions intensity of GDP · A fixed level target.
This has increased the analytical challenge of ensuring consistency when comparing and aggregating different mitigation contributions. The assessment builds on a

The global emission levels in 2030 consistent with having a likely chance (>66 per cent) of staying below the 2°C goal in 2100, following a least-cost pathway from 2020 with only modest improvement of the GHG intensity until then, is 42 GtCO2e (range: 31-44). In 2025 this level is 48 GtCO2e (range: 46-50).
In comparison, global GHG emissions, based on assessment of the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015, are for the unconditional INDCs projected to be at 54 GtCO2e (range: 53-58) in 2025, and 56 GtCO2e (range: 54-59) in 2030. If conditional INDCs are included, the global emissions projection is 53 GtCO2e (range: 52-56) in 2025 and 54 GtCO2e (range: 52-57) in 2030. The emission levels resulting from submitted INDCs are 4 to 6 GtCO2e lower than the current policy trajectory in 2030 of 60 GtCO2e (range: 58-62). They are 9 to 11 GtCO2e lower than the baseline of 65 GtCO2e (range: 60-70), which is based on IPCC AR5 scenarios and assumes no additional climate policies are put in place after 2010.
6. Can the INDC process become a foundation for enhancing ambition?
It is clear from the assessment of the mitigation contributions from the INDCs that much more needs to be done. This round of INDCs should therefore be considered as the first step in building foundations for a successful global climate agreement. The social and political effects of the INDCs and the processes undertaken at national level transcend the aggregate effect they are estimated to have on total global GHG emission levels in 2025 and 2030. The preparation of the INDCs has in many countries incentivized exploration of linkages between development and climate, as well as development of new national climate polices, and can be seen as an important step in a transition towards low carbon economies.
The Paris Agreement can support these national transitions and provide the framework for mobilization of the enhanced mitigation effort that is required to align national efforts with the global mitigation ambition indicated by the 2°C pathways. Establishing a robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework as part of the Paris Agreement will be critical in this context.
The INDCs and options for enhanced mitigation action must be seen in the broader context of economic growth and sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently adopted in New York by Heads of State of all member states of the United Nations explicitly recognise the interdependence between the achievement of climate, development and sustainability goals and recommends prioritizing coherence, co-benefits, and complementarity between the SDGs and a climate change agreement under the UNFCCC.
The SDG Goal 13 ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" specifically acknowledges that the

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change, and the targets associated with the goal are clearly aligned with the ambitions in the INDCs.
7. What are some of the options for closing the gap?

for enhanced mitigation action emphasized in the studies include forestry, agriculture and waste.
These are all sectors that have been assessed in earlier UNEP Emissions Gap Reports and where significant opportunities for bridging the gap have been highlighted through possibilities for replication, acceleration and scaling up proven good practices and policies.

A number of recent global studies conclude that there is a significant potential to reduce global emissions in 2030 ­ beyond the reductions resulting from implementation of the INDCs. If this potential is fully exploited, it could bring global emissions to a level very close to bridge the emissions gap in 2030. Furthermore, the studies suggest that this can be done by relying on proven technologies and policies.
A number of recent studies and reports, including by the IPCC and leading international research institutions, identifies a significant emissions reduction potential by 2030. Acknowledging that the methodologies, assumptions, scope and coverage of measures considered vary across the assessed studies, they all show that tapping into unused emission reduction potential could narrow the emissions gap in 2030 considerably. Taken together, they indicate that global greenhouse gas emissions could be further reduced by between 5 to 12 GtCO2e/yr (range: 3-13) relative to the emissions level resulting from implementation of the unconditional INDCs, and between 5 to 10 GtCO2e/yr (range: 1-11) relative to the emissions level associated with implementation of the conditional INDCs. These reductions could contribute to the reductions needed to bridge the emissions gap in 2030, which as previously stated is estimated at 14 GtCO2e (range: 12-17) for the unconditional INDC case and at 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15), if both unconditional and conditional INDCs are implemented.
There is considerable uncertainty associated with the possibilities for achieving the emission reduction opportunities put forward in some of these studies. At the same time, the studies assessed do not cover all relevant measures, thematic areas and sectors. In other words the total technical and economic emission reduction potential in 2030 could be larger than indicated in the studies assessed. In comparison the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC indicated a total emission reduction potential in 2030 of 23 GtCO2e (range: 16-31). No update of the total emission reduction potential in 2030 was provided in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, but sectoral updates in this report indicate emission reduction potentials in 2030 of the same order of magnitude.
The assessed recent studies emphasize the key importance of enhanced energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on industry, buildings and transport, and expanded use of renewable energy technologies for power production combined with increased efficiency of fossil fuel-based power production will all be critical for achievement of the desired large-scale emission reductions. Other key sectors

8. How can International Cooperative Initiatives contribute to implementation of INDCs and enhance ambitions?
The impact of actions by International Cooperative Initiatives can potentially be significant. Preliminary assessments indicate a contribution in the range of 2.5 to 4 GtCO2e in 2020, if fully implemented. Part of this contribution falls within the Cancun pledges while the additional contribution may be in the range of 0.75 to 2 GtCO2e in 2020.
Significant attention has been put on mitigation actions by ICIs including actors other than Parties to the UNFCCC.
ICIs include a wide variety of activities, which makes consistent and thorough assessment difficult. Nevertheless, an effort has been made to assess all available information and organize it under a simple catalogue of actions categorized by type of constituent engaged. This catalogue serves to focus on those ICIs that have the most impact potential and by disentangling the various initiatives the overlap and double-counting risks with the national pledges can be minimized.
The report examines initiatives in three broad categories:
· Cities and regions · Companies · Sectors
A few examples below illustrate the wide span of ICIs:
· C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group ­ is a network of the world's megacities committed to taking action that reduces global GHG emissions. It has 75 affiliated cities (as of July 2015) and a total of 80 total participants
· The Compact of Mayors - is an agreement by three city networks to undertake a transparent and supportive approach to reduce city-level emissions, and to reduce vulnerability from, and enhance resilience to, climate change, in a consistent and complementary manner to national level climate protection efforts. It builds on ongoing city-level efforts
· Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) - is an alliance of 25 leading companies in the global cement industry created under the auspices of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Participants commit to developing a climate change mitigation strategy, setting reduction targets for CO2 and reporting annually on their progress.

xx The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ Executive summary

A number of new studies have examined the major initiatives and this report presents an assessment of these studies and their estimates of the emission reduction potential for each category of initiative. The studies list a number of challenges related to the analyzed ICIs including elements of overlap between initiatives and comparability of transparent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of results. It is therefore difficult to assess whether all the international initiatives actually deliver on promises, as most initiatives propose only voluntary commitments and hence make it difficult for accountability and compliance to be enforced and sometimes lack robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV).
Many initiatives can, however, play important roles to advance climate action, as they:
· Encourage or facilitate emission reductions at the city and regional level, via knowledge sharing, capacity building and technical support for project planning and implementation
· Identify partnerships and support local communities to become climate resilient
· Represent common city-level interests to influence policymakers at other levels
· Help implement climate plans and low-carbon and climate-resilient economic development projects
· Achieve transparency and accountability by encouraging best practice in GHG emission reporting
· Help overcome financial barriers and attract investors and accelerate additional capital flows into cities for low carbon projects.

The studies compare the emissions reduction potential for the different categories of initiatives compared to a current trajectory baseline (noting that studies are not necessarily using same baseline approaches). Even if uncertainties are quite large, it is interesting that results are quite comparable at the aggregate level, even if the assessment of the different groups of initiatives varies significantly.
The assessment notes that the impact of non-state climate commitments can be significant, most likely in the range between 2.5 and 4 GtCO2e in 2020 (taking into account that not all initiatives are included in all assessments). These numbers include an estimate of overlaps between the various initiatives, in terms of actual actions, sectors, greenhouse gases and regions.
It is harder to estimate the overlap between these nonstate initiatives and government emission reduction pledges for 2020. The recent studies examined in this assessment suggest that the overlap ranges between 33 and 70 per cent, resulting in possible additional net contributions of the order of 0.75 to 2 GtCO2e in 2020.
Even if ICIs are not necessarily additional to national 2020 pledges, they can be an important component of actually implementing these and at the same time facilitate or even drive increased national ambition. Only one study extrapolates the potential reductions to 2030, so it is not possible to present numbers here, but the study indicates that the mitigation contribution from existing ICIs would be substantial.

9. What is the potential for greater forest-related mitigation, in particular through REDD+?
Forest-related mitigation activities in both developing and developed countries are attracting significant political attention, both in the negotiation process over the last years and in many of the submitted INDCs. Special focus is on policies and actions under REDD+ as the theoretical potential of forest-related mitigation activities in developing countries is estimated to be up to 9 GtCO2 in 2030. The realization of this theoretical potential will be constrained by economic and land-use factors.
A rapid review6 has been undertaken of forestry related mitigation actions in the submitted INDCs and these are together with other types of national engagement in forestry related mitigation illustrated in the global map below. The map clearly shows that many countries see potential mitigation opportunities in the forestry sector.
A special focus in the assessment has been devoted to the set of policy approaches and actions known as REDD+ as one option for facilitating cost-effective contributions to climate change mitigation, in developing countries. REDD+ (as defined under the UNFCCC) includes ­ reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.
REDD+ has seen marked progress under the UNFCCC negotiations over the last ten years, as a policy tool to reduce forest related emissions, including on measurement,

safeguards and eligibility for results-based finance. In order for developing countries to access results-based finance for REDD+ emissions reductions or enhanced removals of carbon from the atmosphere, they need to have in place:
· A national strategy or action plan · A national forest monitoring system · A safeguards information system and a summary of
information on how the REDD+ safeguards have been addressed and respected · A forest reference emissions level or forest reference level · Fully measured, reported and verified results, in terms of emission reductions/enhanced removals.
These requirements place some constraints on the potential for REDD+ implementation in the short term, for example the speed at which policies can be put in place and governance improvements can be implemented. The availability of finance, whether domestic or international, to cover the upfront costs of REDD+ measures will also be a determining factor. Results-based finance, by its nature, will be released only after success has been achieved. Many developing countries have expressed their interest in large-scale forest-related actions, both in their INDCs and a range of other statements.
The theoretical emissions reduction potential has been assessed for Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean and is broadly in the range 2.7-3.3 GtCO2 in 2030 for each region. However, the realization of this theoretical potential will be significantly constrained by economic and land-use factors.

Scoping the 2015 report


1.1 Moving towards a new international climate change agreement

of the intended nationally determined contributions"" (UNFCCC, 2014).

The year 2015 has the potential to become a turning point in global efforts to transform the prevailing economic development paradigm into a more sustainable one.
All UN member countries reached agreement in September 2015 on a set of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The main political instrument to address SDG 13 - ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" - is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Countries will meet again at the UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris with the aim of establishing a new international climate change agreement, hereafter the `Paris Agreement', with the ambition of limiting changes in global temperatures to below 2oC or 1.5°C warming in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. The decision ""[...] to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties"" originated at COP 17 in Durban (Decision 1/CP.17) and has been confirmed most recently at COP 20 in Lima (Decision 1/CP.20) (UNFCCC, 2014).
As the foundation for a new agreement, and reiterating decisions of COP 19 in Warsaw, the `Lima Call for Climate Action' requested each Party ""[...] to communicate to the secretariat its intended nationally determined contribution [INDC] towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2"" (UNFCCC, 1992)1 ensuring that these are submitted ""[...] well in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties [...] in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding

The architecture of a new climate agreement has many facets relating to mitigation and adaptation, and the array of issues under negotiation has become significantly more complex since the Convention was established. The Paris Agreement will also aim to establish a framework to enhance capacity building and provide technological and financial support for developing countries to accelerate the transition towards low carbon and climate resilient development paths. A number of key decisions related to these issues will be required, while the core structure of the agreement will be based on the INDCs.
1.2 Key questions
Subsequent to COP 15, UNEP has produced an annual Emissions Gap Report presenting an up-to-date assessment of how actions, pledges and commitments by countries affect the global GHG emissions trend and how this compares to emissions trajectories consistent with the goal of keeping temperatures below 1.5°C or 2°C by 2100. The difference has become known as the emissions gap, calculated for specific target years.
This year, UNEP was requested by a number of countries to undertake an independent scientific assessment of the INDC submissions to inform the political process. The UNFCCC Secretariat has undertaken the formal compilation for COP 21.
The 2015 UNEP Emissions Gap Report asks four principal questions:

1 Article 2 states ""The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner"" (UNFCCC, 1992).

i) What are the latest estimates of 2025 and 2030 total global emissions levels consistent with the goal of holding the global average temperature rise below 2oC or 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels by 2100?
ii) What is the progress on implementation of the Cancun pledges for the period to 2020?
iii) Will the combined INDC commitments for 2030

(if fully implemented) be sufficient to stay within the range consistent with the 2oC temperature goal? iv) What are possible contributions in selected key areas, where action can be accelerated to enhance the ambition of national pledges both in the period before and after the expected entry into force in 2020 of the Paris Agreement? This year the detailed assessment is on possible mitigation contributions from International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) and enhanced forest-related mitigation activities with a focus on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
1.3 Aim of the report and assessment principles
This is the sixth UNEP Emissions Gap Report and while the focus of the assessment has gradually shifted from initially examining the emissions gap in 2020 to focusing on 2030, the scientific basis has remained firmly based on the best available analysis worldwide.
The objective of the report remains the same, which is to assess the global progress towards the emissions reductions required to be on track towards the agreed target of limiting global average temperature increase to below 2°C by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels. In parallel, the report assesses the possible actions to be taken to achieve the necessary reductions and how these can be accelerated and scaled up to close the gap between the target and actual emissions trends ­ a constant feature of this series of reports.
1.4 INDC Assessment process
The INDC assessment team's approach has been to assess the impacts of the INDCs on future global GHG emissions. Global GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 are compared under four scenarios ­ the baseline scenario (assuming no additional climate policies since 2010), the current policy trajectory scenario (includes currently adopted and implemented policies), the INDC scenario (how global GHG emissions might evolve with full implementation of the INDCs) and the 2°C scenario (representing an idealized global scenario consistent with limiting warming to below 2°C by 2100, keeping the option open to strengthen the global temperature target to 1.5°C). Each scenario is a composite in the sense that it draws on multiple individual scenarios from the published literature. The emissions gap is estimated as the difference between the INDC scenario and the 2°C scenario.
The approach to the assessment is characterized by the following principles:
i) For nationally-generated data, assessment is based on the figures directly available in the officially submitted INDCs
ii) For independently-generated data, assessment is based on peer-reviewed published analyses (or on related outputs) by independent modelling groups/

analysts based on the analysis of the information available in the INDCs iii) Participation of a balanced team of experts in the INDC assessment (by gender, professional and sectoral background, institutional affiliation and geographical location).
In the process of preparing the Report and the INDC assessment, experts have frequently debated differences in understanding of assumptions (such as forms of mitigation contribution, conditional versus unconditional INDCs, use of international market mechanisms and treatment of the land use sector). By scrutinising assumptions (used by governments, independent modelling groups and international bodies), the team has been able to resolve many inconsistencies which, in turn, has led to increased confidence in the accuracy and validity of results.
1.5 Organization of the report
The report comprises six chapters ­ this first one scoping the outline, with subsequent ones falling under two main parts of the report.
Part I comprises Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 focuses on the importance of enhanced pre-2020 mitigation action. It starts by presenting recent estimates for global emission levels and assesses pathways consistent with the 2°C and 1.5°C temperature goals, based on the latest available literature. It then explains why enhanced early action matters and outlines the implications of not enhancing action, followed by a review of progress with current 2020 pledges. Chapter 3 assesses the 119 INDCs, covering 146 countries, submitted by 1 October 2015, with a specific focus on the extent to which the INDCs in aggregate contribute to a reduction in global GHG emissions consistent with limiting average global temperature increase to below 2°C in 2100 with >66 per cent chance. The chapter quantifies an emissions gap ­ the gap in 2025 and 2030 between future emission levels with the INDCs fully implemented and the emission levels consistent with the temperature goals of 1.5°C and 2°C in 2100.
PART II explores some of the opportunities for narrowing and potentially bridging the estimated emissions gap in 2030. It starts with an overview of key issues and potentials for reducing GHG emissions by 2030, based on an assessment of a number of recent studies. This is followed by two focal chapters. Chapter 5 assesses the possible contribution to global mitigation efforts by key International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) led by actors other than the Parties to the UNFCCC. Finally, Chapter 6 reviews a range of forest-related mitigation activities and identifies the technical potential for both CO2 emissions reductions and sequestration from these activities in developing countries, and with a special focus on REDD+.
As in previous editions, this year's Report has been put together by an international team of top scientists. This year 42 scientists from 24 scientific groups in 18 countries have contributed to the report.

Chapter 2
The importance of pre-2020 action

2.1 Introduction
This Chapter first discusses recent global emission levels and trends, and reviews where global emissions would be heading in the absence of additional deliberate climate policies. It then presents assessment of global emission pathways that would keep global warming to below respectively 1.5°C or 2°C in 2100. This is followed by an elaboration of why enhanced early action matters and a discussion of the implications of not increasing short-term climate mitigation efforts.
Achievement of the Cancun 2020 pledges will be important for the transition to least-cost mitigation pathways from 2020. Section 2.3 therefore takes a closer look at progress towards achieving the 2020 pledges. The focus is on the Parties that are members of the G20, as these economies collectively generate around three quarters of global GHG emissions. However, it remains critical that all countries advance as far as possible towards achieving ­ and ideally exceeding ­ their Cancun pledges.

increase in 2010-2011), the emissions growth slowed to 1.8 per cent on average over the subsequent two years1. The most recent global emission estimates2 are for the year 2014. In that year, total global Kyoto-GHG emissions3 amounted to about 52.7 GtCO2e/yr (range: 47.9-57.54, Figure 2.1). Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels and industry alone were estimated at 35.5 GtCO2/yr5 for 2014 (range: 32.5-38.56).
In the absence of any further mitigation action compared to these trends, GHG emission projections are set to increase significantly over the 21st century. These projections are influenced by many factors. For example, economic and population growth will generally result in an increase in emissions, while energy intensity improvements in the global economy and reductions of carbon intensity in energy production will generally result in a decrease in emissions. These factors have characterized the last three decades of the 20th century. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, carbon intensity increased again, thus further contributing to rising global emissions.

The 2°C scenarios start from 2020 levels and assume a global least-cost pathway afterwards. Data for these pathways can be found in Table 2.1 under label ""2°C (>66% in 2100)"", along with other temperature target definitions. For each subset the median (solid line), the 20-80% range (dark) and the min-max range (lighter) of Kyoto-GHG emissions are shown.

4 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­The importance of pre-2020 action

A projection of GHG emissions and their driving factors in the absence of dedicated climate policies is often referred to as a `baseline'. In the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Clarke et al., 2014), baselines are defined as ""not to include climate policy after 2010""7. In such baselines, GHG emissions are expected to increase to about 70-90 GtCO2e/yr in 20508, and in most cases global warming would exceed 4°C by the end of the century, as indicated in Figure 2.1.
2.2.2 Pathways towards 1.5°C and 2°C
In 2014, the UNEP Emissions Gap Report described how global temperature levels are linked to so-called carbon dioxide emission budgets, and how these budgets, in line with holding warming to below 2°C, can be spread over time (UNEP, 2014). While these budgets remain useful and valid benchmarks, this year's analysis uses emission scenario data compiled for the IPCC AR59 to further explore the timing of reaching global net zero emissions and the evolution of annual GHG emissions over time. Data from a recent scientific study that described pathways that limit warming to below 1.5°C by 2100 were also included10.
Pathway characteristics for both 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios are provided in Table 2.1. These show pathways with limited action until 2020 and global least-cost mitigation afterwards. These are in line with current policy trajectories (see Section 2.3 and Chapter 3), which suggest that the global community did not enhance its mitigation action from 2010 aligned with long-term least-cost 1.5°C or 2°C pathways from 2010 onward (UNEP, 2014). Therefore, the scenarios used in this year's report assume global emissions in 2020 that are roughly in line with the Cancun pledges for 2020 (that is, 4956 GtCO2e in 2020 as indicated in Table 2.1). Furthermore, the pathways shown allow temperatures to `overshoot' ­ that is, to temporarily exceed the 2°C limit before falling below it again by 210011. These pathways do not represent the only possibilities of limiting warming to below 1.5°C and 2°C. Some level of flexibility is available for emissions falling outside the range. However, this flexibility is not infinite and enhanced pre-2020 action matters (as further discussed in section 2.2.3).
As Table 2.1 shows all scenarios are characterized by net negative global total GHG emissions by 2100. Looking specifically at CO2 emissions that play a dominant role in determining long-term warming as described in Box 2.1, 1.5°C- and 2°C-consistent scenarios reach net zero CO2 emissions globally between 2045 and 2075 (Table 2.1). Scenarios in line with 1.5°C reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. In scenarios that keep warming to below 2°C

with >66 per cent chance, the timing is of the order of one or more decades later, more specifically around 2070 (range: 2060-2075)12.
Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions is a geophysical requirement. It follows directly from the fact that to limit warming to any level, total net CO2 emissions need to be capped, and from the fact that, up to the present day, global CO2 emissions are still rising13. In theory, a small set of scenarios is able to limit warming to below 2°C14 without achieving net negative emissions by 2100 (UNEP, 2014). However, these scenarios all start stringent, global mitigation before 2020 (see also Section 2.2.3), which is no longer considered realistic. Without exception, all 1.5°C scenarios available in the literature reach net negative CO2 emissions by mid-century, even with stringent mitigation action having started in 2010.
In most scenarios, global net zero and negative emissions are achieved by the use of so-called negative emission technologies that offset any residual positive emissions. Such negative emissions might be achieved on a large scale, for example, by massive afforestation or by combining bioenergy with capture and storage of CO2. Bio-energy combined with capture and geological storage of CO2 has been studied increasingly over the past decade, but uncertainties about its large-scale deployment remain (see Annex A for details).
Compared to 2°C pathways, significantly fewer studies have explored pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (Clarke et al., 2014). Findings for the very stringent 1.5°C limit are therefore less robust. However, one scientific review of 1.5°C scenarios (Rogelj et al., 2015a) found that such scenarios are in many aspects similar to 2°C-consistent scenarios, but that they are characterized by faster emissions reductions in the near term (in 2020 and 2030). Compared to 2°C, the rapid and profound decarbonization of the energy system in 1.5°C scenarios is driven by earlier reductions in the power sector, important efforts to limit energy demand in the industry, buildings, and transport sector; and no delays in global mitigation action beyond 2020. This more rapid transformation translates into significantly higher costs. For example, carbon prices are about two or three times higher in 1.5°C scenarios than in scenarios that keep warming to below 2°C with >66 per cent chance (Rogelj et al., 2015a).
2.2.3 Why enhanced early action matters
Enhanced early action facilitates the transition to the stringent, long-term emission reductions required for limiting warming to below 1.5°C and 2°C. It would enable countries i) to overachieve their current pledges by 2020, and ii) to transition towards a pathway in line with a least-cost trajectory after 2020. By making the shift in emissions less abrupt, enhanced pre-2020 and pre-2030 action reduces the so-called transitional challenges (see below). Furthermore, to keep the door open for limiting warming to below 1.5°C by 2100, enhanced early action seems essential. Previous reports (UNEP, 2012, 2013, 2014) provided detailed discussion of the trade-offs between early and late action. Three main areas of importance with respect to enhanced early action were highlighted in particular:1516
1. Economics and technology, where enhanced early action will: · mediate the requirement for very steep emission reductions in the medium term · facilitate mitigation in the medium to long term by reducing lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society as a whole · spur near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term · provide early policy signals which are needed for action in the following decades · reduce the overall costs and economic challenges during the transitional period, for example, in terms of upscaling of energy investments · reduce the dependence on unproven technologies such as negative emissions technologies17 and increase the options society can choose from to achieve stringent emission reductions.
2. Climate outcomes: enhanced early action will reduce climate risks, for example, by influencing the rate of temperature increase (Schaeffer et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014).
3. Co-benefits: enhanced early action will enable the realisation of near-term co-benefits of climate change mitigation, such as improved public health as a result of lower air pollution, improved energy security, and reduced crop yield losses18.

Enhanced early action is thus important. As described above, overachievement of the 2020 pledges will improve the chances for the stringent emission reductions that are required post-2020 ( Rogelj et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014).
2.3 Progress towards the 2020 pledges: a closer look at major economies
Section 2.2 underlined the importance of pre-2020 mitigation action to achieving consistency with the below 2°C by 2100 scenarios. It is critical that all countries, and particularly the highest-emitting economies, advance as far as possible towards achieving ­ and ideally exceeding ­ their Cancun pledges. This section takes a closer look at progress towards achieving these 2020 pledges, focusing on the parties that are members of the G2019. These economies collectively generate around three quarters of global GHG emissions20.
2.3.1 Assessment of G20 countries' 2020 emissions under three cases
The section compares current emissions trajectories of G20 members with the trajectories associated with the achievement of these parties' 2020 pledges. It should be read with three important caveats in mind. First, not all pledges demand the same level of effort to achieve. In other words, a country currently on track to achieve its pledge has not necessarily made a greater effort to mitigate emissions than a country not yet on track21. Secondly, these projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as changes in gross domestic product (GDP), as well as the impact of policies. Thirdly, the emission trajectories analysed here do not quantify the potential impact of using offsets to achieve pledges. If offsets are traded internationally, and are counted towards the pledges of both buying and selling parties, the global impact of the pledges will be weakened. Most countries have not clarified their intentions concerning use of offsets to meet their 2020 pledges. Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, and the United States have explicitly not excluded the possibility; others have not formally commented (CAIT WRI, 2015).

The issue of lock-in is very important in a number of ways. Even with enhanced early action, it is projected that carbon intensive infrastructure, such as unabated coal-fired power plants, will have to be shut down before the end of their lifetime in some stringent mitigation scenarios, and delay exacerbates this (Rogelj et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2015). Furthermore, delay also locks in energy intensive practices. Limiting energy demand is critical to keep stringent mitigation targets within reach (Clarke et al., 2014). Furthermore, the transition to a low energy-demand society is also inhibited by delays of action, as more energy intensive infrastructure continues to be built up. Infrastructure lock-in makes the transition to a low-carbon path harder.
15 16 17 Enhanced early action is important in reducing dependence on negative
emissions in the long term for achieving stringent climate targets like 2°C. However, there are no scenarios available that return warming to below 1.5°C by 2100, without the use of bio-energy combined with capture and geological storage of CO2. 18 Note that the IPCC AR5 also identified adverse side-effects of climate change mitigation, which will have to be considered simultaneously.

Table 2.2 compares 2020 emissions under three cases: a pledge case, based on official data; a current policy trajectory case, based on official data; and a current policy trajectory case, based on independent analysis. These cases are described in Box 2.2.
Box 2.2: Assumptions of analysis of progress towards pledges
For each country or Party, Table 2.2 compares estimates for 2020 emissions under three cases: 1. Pledge case (official data): identifies the maximum level of GHG emissions that each country or Party could emit
in 2020 and still meet its pledge ­ without considering the use of offsets. If a pledge is presented as a range (Brazil, China and India), the less ambitious end of the range is adopted as the official pledge estimate. If a country has both a conditional and unconditional pledge (Indonesia), only the unconditional pledge is used. If a country has only a conditional pledge (Mexico, South Africa), the conditional pledge is used. For countries whose pledges are framed relative to a baseline scenario, it is assumed that baselines are not adjusted in the future. For countries whose pledges are framed as GHG intensity targets, economic growth consistent with official projections is assumed22. Where available, the 2020 emission level described by the country or Party as the pledge level is used; alternatively, these levels are calculated working from official base-year or baseline data. 2. Current policy trajectory case (official data): identifies official estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches, including policies at least through 2012. 3. Current policy trajectory case (independent analysis): similarly identifies estimates of 2020 emissions considering the best current estimates of projected economic trends and current policy approaches, but is based on independent analysis rather than official data. Figures are drawn from the Climate Action Tracker (CAT, 2015) and den Elzen et al. (2015) for all countries, as well as other, country-specific sources where noted. Current policy trajectory (independent analysis) supplements the official sources described in point two by providing data that aim for consistency across countries and political independence. Projections only consider a limited subset of sectors and gases, for example, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are omitted, as they cannot be compared to projections and targets that include the full set of GHGs across the entire economy.
2.3.2 Progress of G20 countries
Based on this analysis, three of the parties considered here ­ China, the EU28, and India ­ are on track to meet their pledges without purchasing offsets according to all available analyses. Three more ­ Brazil, Japan, and Russia ­ are on track according to most estimates and are within one per cent, one per cent, and three per cent of the pledge level, respectively, according to all estimates.



China's and India's pledges are framed in terms of GHG intensity reductions from 2005 levels, and several sources indicate that both countries are currently on track to achieve them. Studies indicate that China, which pledged a reduction of 40-45 per cent in emissions intensity, is on track to achieve a reduction of at least 42 per cent (IEA, 2014a, 2014b; CAT, 2015; PBL, 2015; Sha et al., 2015). For India, Garg et al. (2014) show that by 2012, India had already reduced intensity by 17 per cent out of a pledged reduction of 20­25 per cent by 2020, and the CAT (2015) and PBL (2015) show India on track for a 36 per cent or 28 per cent reduction by 2020, respectively28.
Japan announced an adjustment to its pledge in November 2013 from a 25 per cent reduction on 1990 levels to a 3.8 per cent reduction on 2005 levels (similar to an increase of about 3.1 per cent on 1990 levels). While this adjustment makes it much easier for Japan to achieve its pledge, current official projections still place Japan's 2020 emissions slightly above its pledge threshold (UNFCCC, 2014). Independent projections differ slightly ­ CAT (2015) shows Japan on track to meet its revised pledge, whereas den Elzen et al. (2015) estimates a range in 2020 from slightly below to slightly above the pledge level. Japan's actual trajectory, however, will depend significantly on the respective roles of nuclear power and coal-fired power to meet future needs29.
Canada and Mexico are likely to require further action or purchased offsets, or both in order to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates. Mexico's 2020 pledge is conditional on the provision of adequate financial and technological support from developed countries as part of a global agreement (Mexico, 2015).
According to independent analysis, the Republic of Korea will also require further action to meet its pledge, but this cannot be verified based on publicly available official projections. Independent estimates of 2020 emissions range from well below to well above the pledge level (CAT, 2015; den Elzen et al., 2015).
In the cases of Australia30 and the USA, government and independent analyses reach differing conclusions regarding each country's progress towards its pledge. In the case of Australia, the government projects 2020 emissions of approximately 655 MtCO2e, not including the impact of the Emission Reduction Fund (ERF). The Australian government states that it is ""on track"" to meet its target of 533 MtCO2e, and that the ERF has contracted projects expected to deliver abatement of 47 MtCO2e (Commonwealth of Australia, 2015). Prior to the initial auction, CCA (2014) reviewed studies of the potential of the ERF and concluded, ""In short, these studies suggest that the ERF's contribution to reducing emissions is likely to fall some way short of what is required to meet Australia's minimum 2020 target"". Independent analyses (CAT, 2015; PBL 2015) project emissions above the pledge level.
The USA contends that the `with additional measures' scenario from a 2014 addendum to its biennial report now represents its current policy trajectory. This trajectory shows the United States on track to achieve its pledge. Independent analyses, by contrast, find that further action is still necessary (see, for example, Rhodium Group, 2014; Belenky, 2015; CAT, 2015; Hausker et al., 2015; PBL, 2015).
Insufficient information is currently available to determine whether Indonesia and South Africa are on track to meet their pledges. In the case of Indonesia, independent projections span a wide range, and official projections reflecting current policies are unavailable. In the case of South Africa, official projections to 2020 do not reflect recently adopted and implemented policies, and independent estimates vary widely, from well below the pledge level to well above it. South Africa's pledge is conditional.
Finally, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not proposed GHG reduction pledges for 2020 (as of 1 October 2015, Argentina and Turkey had submitted post-2020 pledges to the UNFCCC as part of their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions).
Despite progress towards implementing policies in line with pledges, work remains to be done to bring all G20 countries into pledge attainment. Additionally, better data are necessary to adequately track this progress in some countries. Ensuring continued progress towards 2020 pledges will reduce the mitigation burden associated with achieving the post-2020 pledges put forward in the INDCs.
This section has examined the extent to which G20 countries are proceeding towards the minimum level of their 2020 pledges, in light of the importance of pre-2020 GHG reductions for achieving consistency with 2°C scenarios, with implications beyond 2020. As described earlier in this chapter, this report does not address the global emissions gap in 2020, so the cumulative impact of the progress towards 2020 pledges is not calculated. UNEP (2014) found that emissions under the global current policy trajectory ­ taking into account progress by the G20 countries ­ roughly aligned with the higher-emissions end of the range associated with meeting the unconditional pledges.
It is important to recognise that these pledge levels do not align with the least-cost pathways to limit warming with stringent mitigation action starting in 2010 (UNEP, 2014). Ideally, all countries with 2020 pledges will recognise the need to exceed their undertakings while countries without 2020 pledges will strengthen their own mitigation ambition with appropriate polices and measures. This would allow a transition towards a pathway in line with a least-cost trajectory after 2020, with the associated economic, technology, societal co-benefits, and climate outcome benefits highlighted in section 2.2.



3.1 Introduction
The Lima Call for Climate Action, adopted by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2014, noted the gap between Parties' mitigation pledges for 2020 and the emission pathways consistent with limiting the increase in global average temperature to below 2°C or 1.5°C (UNFCCC, 2014). It reiterated the invitation issued by the 2013 Warsaw decision for Parties to communicate their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) towards achieving the objective of the Convention (UNFCCC, 2013) (see Box 3.1).

This chapter explores the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 (UNFCCC, 2015a), with a specific focus on the extent to which the INDCs in aggregate are in accordance with the long-term objective of the Convention, which is ""[...] to achieve [...] stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". The chapter quantifies an `emissions gap' ­ the gap between future emissions under full implementation of the INDCs and under the pathways consistent with limiting warming to below 2°C in 2100 ­ for the years 2025 and 2030. The Chapter first presents qualitative information about the

Box 3.1: INDCs in the Warsaw (2013) and Lima (2014) decisions under the UNFCCC
The Warsaw decision 1/CP19 (UNFCCC, 2013) introduced the concept of INDCs as follows: · All Parties are invited to initiate or intensify preparations for their INDCs, without prejudice to the legal nature of the
contributions · All Parties are invited to communicate their INDCs well in advance of COP 21 ""[...] (by the first quarter of 2015 by
those Parties ready to do so) in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions"".
The Lima decision 1/CP20 (UNFCCC, 2014) reiterated the points agreed in Warsaw, and also: · Agreed that each Party's intended nationally determined contribution towards achieving the objective of the
Convention as set out in its Article 2 will represent a progression beyond the current undertaking of that Party · Invited all Parties to consider communicating their undertakings in adaptation planning or consider including an
adaptation component in their INDCs · Agreed that the information to be provided by Parties may include, as appropriate, inter alia, quantifiable information
on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year), time frames and/or periods for implementation, scope and coverage, planning processes, assumptions and methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals, and how the Party considers that its INDC is fair and ambitious, in light of its national circumstances, and how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 (UNFCCC, 1992).
INDCs submitted, concerning ­ for example, the treatment of adaptation, equity, and various GHG accounting issues. It then quantifies future global GHG emission pathways with full implementation of INDCs out to 2030, and compares them to the pathways for limiting warming to below 2°C that were described in Chapter 2.2. INDCs that countries intend to achieve unconditionally, as well as INDCs that are subject to conditions (such as the provision of international climate finance), are evaluated separately. A final update of the assessment including later submissions will be presented on the UNEP Live website before the start of COP 21.
3.2 Broad characteristics of submitted INDCs
By 1 October 2015, a total of 119 INDCs, covering 146 countries and 85-88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012 (JRC/PBL, 2012; WRI, 2015), had been submitted to the UNFCCC1,2. Every INDC includes a mitigation component and just over 85 per cent cover both mitigation and adaptation. Fifteen INDCs cover mitigation only.
Mitigation INDCs were submitted by countries from all regions (see Figure 3.1), and the 10 largest emitters had all submitted their INDCs by 1 October. These are, in descending order of emission levels, China, the USA, EU, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Canada and Mexico. The review of the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 identified broad mitigation-related groupings as follows:
Coverage: 38 INDCs explicitly state that they are economy-wide. Many of these cover 100 per cent of national GHG emissions, while another specifies 98.5 per cent coverage.
Sectors: 50 INDCs include all major IPCC sector categories (energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, waste, and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)), while 61 INDCs are sector-specific. Eight INDCs do not explicitly state which sectors are covered.
Nitrogen trifluoride: 19 INDCs cover nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, also a Kyoto gas from 2013 onward) in addition to all Kyoto GHGs of the first commitment period. With respect to NF3, two countries (Gabon and Republic of Congo) indicate the gas is to be included in future.
Selective GHGs: 50 INDCs cover only CO2, N2O and CH4 (and another INDC includes SF6 in addition to these). Eleven INDCs include only CO2 emissions, while two (Mauritius and Mexico), besides first-commitment-period Kyoto Protocol gases, also include Short Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF)3.
100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP): The common metric of 100-year GWP values is indicated in some, but not
all, INDCs, referring to different IPCC Assessment Reports (ARs). GWP values used in INDCs are not all the same. 38 INDCs indicate the use of 100-year GWP values from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (AR2), while 29 INDCs use values from the IPCC AR4. Mexico, Brazil and Ecuador use 100-year GWP values from the IPCC AR5. Brazil further indicated 100-year Global Temperature Potential (GTP) values from the IPCC AR5.
3.2.1 Forms of mitigation contributions
Figure 3.1 illustrates that Parties' mitigation contributions take several forms. Below, the various forms of targets included by Parties in their INDCs are summarized.
Base year target: 32 INDCs report on an absolute reduction from historical base year emissions. The base year chosen varies, with 1990, 2005 and 2010 being the most common. Most Parties chose 2030 as the target year for their INDCs. However, 11 countries chose 2025.
Baseline scenario target: The form of emissions reduction relative to a baseline projection has been chosen in 63 INDCs, mainly for countries located in South and Central America, Africa and South Asia. Two countries using a baseline scenario target are Guyana and Mozambique. They quantify the MtCO2e they intend to reduce, but do not specify relative baseline emissions projections.
Trajectory target: South Africa has a trajectory target stating the emission range in 2025 and 2030 and adds an emission range in absolute Mt to its trajectory target. Specifying a peaking year is part of China's and Singapore's INDCs. In these cases, the timing of the maximum CO2 emissions has been communicated, but not the level, while adding intensity targets.
Intensity target: China also specifies the carbon intensity of GDP, indicating percentages by which CO2 emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 2030, compared to the 2005 intensity. Singapore adopts the same approach, but for all GHG emissions, giving an emission intensity of GDP. A further four countries (Chile, India, Tunisia and Uruguay) indicate reductions in emission intensity of GDP as the main form of their mitigation INDC.
Fixed level target: Seven countries put forward a fixed level target; that is, they specify the MtCO2e that they intend not to exceed in a given year (Armenia, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Israel and Sierra Leone). Kenya's INDC, though framed as percentage emission reduction relative to a baseline projection, adds the Mt in the same sentence; the calculation of absolute emissions in 2030 is simple multiplication.
Actions and non-GHG metrics only: Six countries (Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Malawi, Myanmar, Rwanda and Swaziland) include only actions and another four countries only non-GHG metrics (Cape Verde, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu).
Additional non-GHG metrics: Some INDCs include additional non-GHG metrics, for example, in the form of a target for non-fossil-fuel primary energy share, in the case of China, and a reduction from baseline projections of Short Lived Climate Pollutants, in the case of Mexico.


Renewable energy (RE) target: 42 INDCs include quantified renewable energy (RE) targets as a form of non-GHG metric or actions consistent with their GHG target, in addition to other forms. For example, Brazil targets 45 per cent of renewables in its energy mix by 2030, including expanding the use of renewable energy sources other than hydropower to between 28-33 per cent and increasing the share of renewables (other than hydropower) in the power supply to at least 23 per cent. Furthermore, eight INDCs (Cape Verde, Gabon, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu) made RE targets part of their headline mitigation contribution. As an example, Gabon's RE target is expressed as 80 per cent of electricity supply from hydropower by 2025, and as a summary component of its mitigation INDC in addition to an emission reduction target, while Samoa's contribution is a ""[...] 100% renewable energy target for electricity generation through to the year 2025"".
From the above review, it is evident that, in the absence of agreed forms of mitigation contribution and the units in which those might be expressed, countries have selected a wide variety of forms. Over 50 per cent of the mitigation INDCs have taken the form of emission reduction relative to a baseline projection. Within single forms, different units have been chosen; forms are not mutually exclusive; and several countries have chosen more than one form of mitigation contribution. This has increased the analytical challenge of comparing INDC elements and ensuring consistency when aggregating the different contributions.
3.2.2 Treatment of Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use
The vast majority of INDCs includes the land-use sector or a component of it. Only a few countries (including Albania, Andorra, Djibouti, Georgia, Marshall Islands, Republic of Macedonia and Trinidad and Tobago) explicitly exclude it. Some countries (for example, Republic of Korea) indicate that a decision on whether to include LULUCF will be made later. Few countries explicitly include a separate forest goal (for example, Benin, China and India).
Most Parties referring to LULUCF include it (or at least the forest component of it) as any other sector within the INDC. In some cases it is not clear if LULUCF is included in the base year. Among those Parties referring to LULUCF accounting rules (most developed or Annex I country Parties), in several cases there is some uncertainty on which rule will be applied. Canada, United States and Australia intend to use a net-net approach4. Japan and Switzerland declare the use of an equivalent methodology to those under the Kyoto Protocol. New Zealand will confirm details of the accounting approach prior to or upon ratification of the Paris agreement. The EU indicates that policy on how to include LULUCF will be established as soon as technical conditions
allow. In addition, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada declared also that emissions from natural disturbances may or will be excluded, consistent with available IPCC guidance.
Almost all developing countries have mitigation actions both in agriculture and LULUCF. In many cases, LULUCF represents the most relevant current source of emissions and the main area for future mitigation. Often REDD+ is mentioned, but sometimes the relationship between INDC and REDD+ is not fully clear.
Several developing countries include specific LULUCF information within the unconditional and the conditional targets (for example the expected LULUCF mitigation and the related cost of implementation).
In terms of methodology for estimating GHG emissions and removals, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines are mentioned as the primary guidance by most countries (including all developed country Parties). The 2003 Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF is mentioned by few countries (for example, Kenya, Madagascar, Peru, Jordan and Benin). Some countries also refer to the 1996 IPCC guidelines (for example, Argentina, Democratic Republic of Congo, Macedonia and Republic of Korea).
3.2.3 Adaptation components in INDCs and undertakings in adaptation planning
The Lima decision invited all Parties to consider including an adaptation component in their INDCs or to consider communicating their undertakings in adaptation planning. Components on adaptation have been included in just over 85 per cent of INDCs submitted by 1 October (102/119). Of these, three (Australia, Israel and Monaco) indicate in their INDCs that they are working to build their adaptation strategies during 2015, while Brazil´s INDC states that it is ""[...] working on the design of new public policies, through its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), in its final elaboration phase"", and Macedonia's INDC states that ""[...] climate change adaptation shall be the subject of more detailed analysis in the future"" (UNFCCC, 2015a).
Four undertakings in adaptation planning were submitted or referred to in the INDCs submitted to the UNFCCC. Undertakings in adaptation planning were submitted by both the EU and the USA. These are available on the UNFCCC website (UNFCCC, 2015b) as distinct from the INDC portal (UNFCCC, 2015a). Furthermore, New Zealand and Norway refer in their INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015a) to undertakings in adaptation planning by referring to chapters in their national communications.
3.2.4 Specifying support required or offered
Several countries have stated requirements for support for their INDCs in the form of finance, technology transfer, and investment in capacity building, and through international support or the use of international market mechanisms or both.
Conditional versus unconditional INDCs: 42 INDCs have both unconditional and conditional components to their GHG emission reduction targets while 39 include only conditional contributions. 37 INDCs do not make a clear distinction between conditional and unconditional provisions in their INDCs.


Use of international market mechanisms: 22 INDCs indicate they will mainly achieve their emission reductions domestically, although only seven of these specifically state international market mechanisms will not be used. An explicit intention to use these mechanisms is stated by 11 countries, while 20 INDCs express support for their use and a further 23 are considering their potential use. Norway and Iceland indicate in their INDCs that they will likely continue their participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Liechtenstein's INDC indicates ""[...] supplemental emission reductions abroad"", while Albania, Chad, Ethiopia, Montenegro and Rwanda intend to ""[...] sell carbon credits"". In formulating their mitigation INDCs, four countries (Ghana, Guyana, Japan and New Zealand) have assumed that international mechanisms will be used.
Requests for international support, including finance: 91 countries have indicated requirements for international support, with 71 INDCs quantifying these requirements in monetary terms. Examples include India's INDC, which notes that ""[...] a preliminary estimate suggests that at least US$2.5 trillion will be required [...]"" as a total cost, for its intended contributions, and Morocco's INDC, which communicates that meeting its target will require US$45 billion of investment, of which US$35 billion is conditional on international support (UNFCCC, 2015a). Ethiopia notes that ""[...] full implementation of Ethiopia's INDC requires support in the form of finance, capacity building and technology transfer"", and estimates that implementing its Green Economy Strategy requires expenditure which exceeds US$150 billion (UNFCCC, 2015a). Another example comes from Kenya's INDC, which states that ""Kenya will require support in form of finance, investment, technology development, and capacity building"", estimating that ""[...] over US$40 billion is required for mitigation and adaptation actions across sectors up to 2030"". For further detail on these examples, see UNFCCC (2015a).
Offers of international support (including finance): No Annex II country has specified finance, technology or capacity-building support that might be offered or provided in the future. China has offered support for other developing countries, ""[...] including the small island developing countries, the least developed countries and African countries"", and plans to establish the ""Fund for SouthSouth Cooperation on Climate Change"". Finally, the Republic of Belarus stated that it has supported, and will support, developing nations, mainly in the area of awareness-raising, education, capacity building, and in the area of research and development relating to climate change issues. For further detail on these examples, see UNFCCC (2015a).
3.2.5 How countries address equity, ambition and Article 2 of the Convention
The Lima decision invited information on fairness and ambition, and how the INDC contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 (UNFCCC, 1992).
In relation to the objective of the Convention, 52 of the INDCs make reference to Article 2 (verbatim or indirectly),

while 62 INDCs refer to the 2°C goal; 36 INDCs make no reference to either Article 2 or 2°C.
Most INDCs have addressed equity (or fairness) and ambition in some way. However, 80 INDCs do not offer specific metrics to support their claims to relative fairness in relation to their INDCs, instead providing only general statements or reference to principles. A further 31 INDCs draw on analyses conducted by modelling teams or experts from within the country. Only eight INDCs ­ Andorra, Brazil, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway, Republic of Moldova, South Africa and Switzerland ­ refer to external, independent analyses.
On equity, a range of arguments and indicators is referred to in the INDCs. The most common indicator chosen is per capita emission levels, described in 57 INDCs. Specifically, 68 INDCs refer to their countries representing a small share of global emissions. Additionally nine INDCs (Andorra, Armenia, Bangladesh, EU, Japan, Jordan, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland) reference ranges in IPCC reports for consistency with 2°C.
Further details are available in Annex B of this report (available online), presenting a summary of key characteristics of all INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 in table form.
3.3 Methodology for quantifying the effect of INDCs on global GHG emissions
3.3.1 Overview of scenarios
To assess the impact of the INDCs on future global GHG emissions, global GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 are compared under four scenarios. Each scenario is composite. It draws on multiple individual scenarios from the published literature in line with the characteristics described below.
· The baseline scenario assumes that no additional climate policies have been put in place since 2010 (see also Chapter 2). It is sourced from the scenario database that accompanied the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Clarke et al., 2014).
· The current policy trajectory scenario takes into account currently adopted and implemented policies. It is based on (i) the current policies scenarios from three5 out of the eight global INDC analyses6 that provide such current policy trajectory scenarios, (ii) official country-specific data sources, and (iii) independent country-specific data sources, as detailed in Table 3.1.
· The INDC scenario portrays how global GHG emissions might evolve with full implementation of INDCs. It is sourced from (i) the official estimates included in the INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015a), (ii) calculations based on the INDCs and on other documents submitted by countries to the UNFCCC (such as national GHG inventories, national communications, biennial reports, and biennial update reports), (iii) estimates published in country-specific studies, and (iv) eight global analyses, described further below.

· The 2°C scenario represents an idealized global scenario consistent with limiting warming to below 2°C, keeping the option open to strengthen the global temperature target to 1.5°C. It comprises the subset of scenarios from the IPCC AR5 scenario database that (i) have a greater than 66 per cent chance of keeping global temperature increase to below 2°C in 2100 compared pre-industrial levels, (ii) are consistent with full implementation of 2020 pledges that are anchored in the Cancun Agreements, and

Table 3.1: Overview of INDC studies included in the assessment by type of source (in alphabetical order)
(iii) distribute emission reductions across regions, gases and sectors after 2020 in such a way that that global mitigation costs of necessary reductions are minimized.
3.3.2 Methodology for current policy trajectory and INDC scenarios
While the baseline and 2OC scenarios are drawn entirely from the IPCC AR5 database and have not been adjusted, the data sources and methodologies for the current policy trajectory and INDC scenarios are more complex, as indicated above and in Table 3.1. The methodology in the assessment of these scenarios is therefore described in more detail in the following.
As mentioned, the current policy trajectory scenario draws from the current policy scenarios of three of the eight global analyses, in addition to current policy scenarios from official and independent country-specific sources. Where no data are available from official or independent country-specific sources, the assessment uses the median current policy scenario estimate from the three global studies.
Current policy trajectory scenarios assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies ­ even if it results in 2020 pledges not being achieved or being overachieved. Current policy trajectories reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or their equivalent. This implies that publicly announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. Ultimately, however, these definitions may be interpreted differently in the different underlying studies. This assessment is bound by the definitions that the individual research groups use.
The INDC scenario draws on individual INDC scenarios from the same eight global analyses. It furthermore draws on official and independent country-specific sources, as indicated in Table 3.1. These are converted to two global estimates in the same manner as for the current policy trajectory scenario. Finally, it considers five additional scenarios that are created by combining emission growth rates of the non-INDC countries from five modelling groups (Tavoni et al., 2015)7 with the median emission values for INDC-countries taken from the INDC scenarios of the eight global INDC analyses, and the two additional analyses based on the aggregated official and independent country-specific data sources8. The resulting composite INDC scenario comprises the median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile global estimates for 2025 and 2030 from all of these sources.
3.3.3 Unconditional and conditional INDC cases
As discussed in section 3.2, some countries place conditions on all or part of their INDCs. Consequently, two cases are explored in this assessment: unconditional INDCs and conditional INDCs. In the unconditional INDC case, Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement targets without conditions only. Parties that solely have a conditional target, or have not submitted an INDC, are assumed to follow a current policy trajectory. In the conditional INDC case all Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement their conditional targets. Parties that only have an unconditional target are assumed to implement that target, and Parties with no INDCs are assumed to follow a current policy trajectory, or if that is not available, a baseline scenario. In both the unconditional and the conditional INDC cases, it is assumed that for any traded international offsets, each unit is counted towards the INDC of a single country only ­ either the buyer or the seller.
The studies from which the current policy trajectory scenario and the INDC scenario are drawn differ in a number of respects, such as: conditional versus unconditional INDCs; assumptions regarding non-covered sectors and gases; treatment of LULUCF and surplus emission units; and different bases for calculating Global Warming Potentials (GWPs).
The methodological differences between the groups cannot be fully harmonized, which leads to some uncertainty as indicated in the results presented in Section 3.4, where the implications of the differences between studies are also further explored.
3.4 The effect of INDCs on global GHG emissions
This section presents the findings regarding the aggregate effect on global total GHG emissions of full implementation of the INDCs in 2025 and 2030, compared to the emissions implied by baseline, current policy trajectory and 2°C scenarios. The results are shown in Figure 3.2, with details on medians and ranges provided in Table 3.2. It should be noted that the baseline emission projection is about 2.5 GtCO2e lower in 2030 compared to the projection in last year's Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2014). The reason is that this year baseline emission projections are not harmonized to the global GHG emissions of 49.5 GtCO2e in 2010.
Taken together, Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2 show that full implementation of the unconditional INDCs will reduce global GHG emissions in 2025 by 7 GtCO2e (range: 3-8) relative to the baseline, and by 3 GtCO2e (range: 0-4) relative to the current policy trajectory. This leaves a gap in 2025 of 7 GtCO2e (range: 5-10) between the unconditional INDC scenario and the 2 oC scenario.
In 2030, the reduction from the unconditional INDCs is 9 GtCO2e (range: 6-11) relative to the baseline and 4 GtCO2e

(range: 1-6) relative to the current policy scenario, leaving a gap of 14 GtCO2e (range: 12-17) between the INDC scenario and the 2oC scenario (See Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2) 9.
In comparison, if countries were to also fully implement the conditional INDCs, global GHG emissions in 2025 would be reduced by 8 GtCO2e (range: 5-9) relative to the baseline, and by 4 GtCO2e (range: 1-5) relative to the current policy trajectory. This leaves a gap in 2025 of 5 GtCO2e (range: 4-8) between the combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs and the 20C scenario.
In 2030, the emission reduction from the combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs is 11 GtCO2e (range: 8-13) relative to the baseline, and 6 GtCO2e (range: 3-8) relative to the current policy scenario, leaving a gap of 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15) between the INDC scenario and the 2oC scenario in 2030.

3.4.1 Temperature implications of the emission levels resulting from the INDCs
The temperature implications of the emission levels implied by the INDCs are illustrated in Figure 3.3, which compares the emission levels estimated for the unconditional and conditional INDCs with emission pathways over the 21st century11,12.

Excluding the potential impact of surplus emission units (for countries where achieving the INDC generates higher emissions than their current policy trajectory), would further reduce this gap by 0.5 GtCO2e (range: 0-1) by 2030, to a final level of 12 GtCO2e (range: 9-15).
If countries that have not yet submitted an INDC were to reduce their emissions by the same average percentage below current trajectories as those that have already
submitted their INDCs (as of 1 October 2015), the gap for the full implementation of both unconditional and conditional INDCs could be narrowed by an additional 0.5 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1 GtCO2e in 2030, to 11 GtCO2e10.

Scenarios are grouped based on the level of warming they avoid during the 21st century with at least 66% chance, and show median (black line), 15-85th percentile range (dark coloured boxes), and the minimum maximum range (ligher shaded boxes). The 10-90th percentile range for the INDC cases is shown.

The Figure illustrates that compared to the levels of 4°C and above that would be expected under baseline projections (see also Chapter 2) current policies and full implementation of the INDCs would reduce the long-term temperature projections. More specifically, Figure 3.3 illustrates that full implementation of unconditional INDC results in estimated 2030 emission levels that are most consistent with scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3.5°C by the end of the century 2100 with >66 per cent chance.
Figure 3.3 furthermore illustrates that a move from implementation of the unconditional to combined implementation of both conditional and unconditional INDCs would have an effect on long-term temperature projections. Combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs, results in projections becoming more

consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3°C by the end of the century with a greater than 66 per cent chance13.
There is significant overlap between the ranges of the unconditional and conditional INDC emission levels, as well as between the scenario bins. Taking uncertainty ranges into account, the 3.5°C value for implementation of unconditional INDCs could decrease to 3°C or increase towards 4°C for the low and high unconditional INDC estimates respectively. When including the full implementation also of conditional INDCs, the emission level estimates taking uncertainty ranges
into account become most consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3-3.5°C by the end of the century with >66 per cent chance.

current policy trajectories (2020, 2025, and 2030), Cancun pledges (2020), and unconditional and conditional INDCs (2025 and 2030) by the different studies considered.

3.4.2 Overview of differences between studies and their implications
A number of methodological factors can contribute to differences in findings between studies. To illustrate the range of estimates from the studies considered for this assessment, Figure 3.4 provides an overview of historical emissions (2010),

The figure illustrates that differences can be significant. However, it is noteworthy that, amongst all the global modelling and country-specific scenarios, there is unanimity that full INDC implementation would indeed reduce global emission levels in 2025 and 2030 relative to the current policy trajectory.

Median 2020 pledges 10th and 90th

Notes: Uncertainty ranges for baseline and 2°C scenarios are the 20th and 80th percentile of the full scenario dataset, the uncertainty range for current policy trajectories is assumed to be the same as for the baseline, the uncertainty ranges of the INDC scenario is 10th to 90th percentile of the data points.
Subsequent to the finalization of this gap assessment, the IEA has updated their unconditional INDC emission estimate for 2030 to 52 GtCO2e. This is approximately 2 GtCO2e lower than the estimate shown in the figure and based on IEA (2015).

22 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030

The main factors that contribute to the discrepancies and consequently the approximate ranges in the 2030 emission estimates are described below. Where possible, the uncertainty that each discrepancy implies for 2030 global emissions, is also indicated.
· Non-covered sectors and countries: There is often a significant range in the emission estimates for sectors not included under INDC pledges, such as emissions from international aviation and maritime transport (bunkers) and for countries which have not submitted an INDC. For example, the uncertainty range across the model groups for the emission projections from international bunker emissions are 1.7 GtCO2e (range: 1.3-2.1), which is consistent with the uncertainty ranges of the projections from international shipping and aviation organisations (ICAO, 2013; IMO, 2014). The results from different studies will vary, since some have explored the impact of mitigation policies of only a subset of countries.
· Uncertainties surrounding the emission projections of the countries with INDCs: Modelling groups have used different assumptions regarding the implementation of INDCs. Many INDCs put forward absolute GHG emission goals, which can be represented easily. There are also many INDCs that referenced a business-as-usual emission projection. However, for most INDCs an estimate of target-year or target-period emissions is given. The quantification of these INDCs is not surrounded with moderate uncertainties (see Section 3.5). The few countries putting forward GDP emission intensity targets (measured as the improvement in emissions per unit of GDP), did not provide target-year GDP estimates or indicate the data source for GDP absolute level, BAU, or reference level if given. The quantification of these INDCs with intensity targets poses additional uncertainties.
· Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): LULUCF plays a relevant role in the mitigation target of most INDCs. Quantification of the LULUCF contribution depends on the availability of adequate official information from each country on: (i) the modality of inclusion of LULUCF in the INDC (for example, LULUCF treated as any other sector or through special accounting rules); (ii) historical data and projections (for example, from INDC, GHG inventories, National Communications, Biennial Update Reports). Using information available in 32 INDCs14 and based entirely on countries' information, the unconditional LULUCF mitigation contribution is estimated at around 1.6 GtCO2 (of which 0.5 GtCO2 comes from Annex I countries). In addition 0.3 GtCO2 is explicitly indicated as conditional (from nonAnnex I countries). Taking into account uncertainties due to accounting rules of ±0.3 GtCO2 for Annex I countries, and due to countries' projections, the total range of LULUCF contribution ranges from negative

contributions of 0.1 GtCO2 to positive contributions of 4.3 GtCO2. This range does not consider possible future natural disturbances in Annex I countries explicitly, the impact of which is assumed to be excluded according to UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol provisions. Another source of uncertainty for Annex I countries is the modality of inclusion of LULUCF in the base year, whose impact on GHG allowances is estimated as ±0.2 GtCO215. For non-Annex I countries, uncertainty stems from the range of country projections available and from the availability of adequate support to achieve the conditional targets. · Impact of harmonization of global 2010 emissions (no impact on emissions gap): The median estimate of all model teams shows global emissions of 47.5 GtCO2e in 2010, which is lower than the independent global emission estimates of the IPCC AR5 of about 49.5 GtCO2e (range: 45-54). In Chapter 2, the global emission pathways consistent with meeting the below 2°C target also have global emissions with a median estimate of 47.5 GtCO2e by 2010, so the discrepancy between the historical emissions and the emission projections resulting from the INDCs of the model teams has not been corrected. If we were to resolve the discrepancy in historical emissions (that is, harmonization), this would also increase the emission projections resulting from the INDCs by about 2 GtCO2e (under a constant harmonization) or about 1 GtCO2e (under a decreasing harmonization, towards zero by 2050, for example). However, as the global emission pathways consistent with meeting the 2°C target also need to be harmonized, and thus would increase by the same amount, harmonization has no impact on the global emissions gap. · Conditional versus unconditional INDCs: Some studies report separate figures for conditional and unconditional INDCs, while others combine this aspect with other uncertainties in a maximum/minimum range or leave out the conditional targets completely. · Surplus emission units: For countries where the emission level resulting from the INDC is higher than the current policy trajectory, some studies use the current policies trajectory as the value for the INDC emission level, implying that they do not allow the use of surplus emissions, whereas the other studies assume INDC emission levels. · Global Warming Potential: About 25 per cent of all countries have submitted their INDC based on GWP from the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC. Many of the models, however, still work based on GWP from the Second IPCC Assessment Report. It is not always possible to convert from one GWP to another in the context of a particular study without making assumptions that may differ by modelling group. · Differences between data sources for historic data and projections: Assumptions differ on baselines and reference years.

3.5 INDCs of G20 countries
This section presents additional findings concerning the emissions of some of the highest-emitting countries ­ namely 13 of the G20 countries (counting the EU as one) that had submitted their INDCs by 1 October 2015. Their emission levels and INDCs have the largest impact on the aggregate, global findings of this assessment.

Cross-cutting information regarding national emissions, emissions per GDP and emissions per capita for these countries is summarized in Figure 3.5, Figure 3.6, and Figure 3.7 respectively. The figures present this crosscutting information for historic emissions (for 1990 and 2010), current policy trajectories (for 2020, 2025, and


2030)16, Cancun pledges (for 2020)17, and unconditional and conditional (in the case of India, Indonesia and Mexico) INDC cases (for 2030, noting that for USA, the 2025 unconditional INDC is shown).
By comparing the current policy trajectory scenarios and the INDC scenarios, the figures indicate whether or not a

country is on track to meet its 2020 pledge (as discussed in Chapter 2.3) and its INDC target. The figures do not attempt to comment on the ambition of either the 2020 pledges or the INDC targets. It is also important to note that the current policy trajectory scenarios, which attempt to reflect the most recent mitigation policies, differ from the baseline or ""business as usual"" scenarios employed by some countries, which typically assume that no new policies are adopted or implemented after a given cut-off year.
Figure 3.5 shows that the emissions from middle-income countries such as Mexico, Indonesia (only for conditional INDC), Brazil and South Korea are expected to peak before 2025. Emissions of China and India are expected to peak by

2030 or later. These countries have relatively high emission intensities due to carbon intensive economies. Emissions from most high-income countries have already peaked. The EU28 peaked around 1980, the Russian Federation around 1990, and in Canada, Japan, and the USA around 2005.
The emission levels as a result of INDCs show a decline in per capita emissions between 2010 and 2030, except for China, India and the Russian Federation (Figure 3.6)
All countries show a substantive reduction and convergence in emission intensity (emissions per GDP) by 2030 as a result

of their INDCs (Figure 3.7). The largest reductions take place in countries with the highest emission intensities in 2010, such as Indonesia and China.
In addition, detailed findings for each of the above-mentioned countries are provided in Annex 1 to this report. For each of these countries, Annex 1 includes a brief description of the elements of the INDC that have been considered by the modelling groups. A discussion of the reasons for discrepancies between different data sources is included. Data is sourced from the global studies, the national studies and official government sources.

26 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 ­ The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030

3.6 Concluding remarks
A number of important policy implications can be drawn based on the assessment presented above. First, due to the steep rate at which global emissions must decline after 2020 to be consistent with the 2°C scenario, the emissions gap grows rapidly over time. This underscores the importance of enhanced early action to reduce emissions. Secondly, bearing in mind the emissions gap that remains even under the most optimistic assumptions about the INDCs, countries should not assume that these proposed contributions will be sufficient to meet agreed global objectives. While an appropriate level of additional ambition would depend on equity considerations, in general, countries should expect that additional ambition will be necessary. Failure to anticipate this could result in technological lock-in and stranded assets. Third, the INDC process has proven to elicit greater ambition from countries relative to a current policy trajectory. Future calls for INDCs may therefore be successful in eliciting even greater ambition. Early calls to enhance ambition for the 2020 to 2030 timeframe can best address the need for enhanced early action.
In this context the IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014) highlighted that if GHG emissions are above 55 GtCO2e in 2030, challenges of transitioning to low emission levels in line with 2°C in the

longer term will become particularly daunting (Figure 6.32 in Clarke et al., 2014). The challenges are much reduced if 2030 Kyoto-GHG emissions are kept below 50 GtCO2e (Clarke et al., 2014), or even more so, to 42 GtCO2e in line with a leastcost 2°C pathway after 2020.
To sum up, this assessment of the aggregate effect of the INDCs on global total GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 essentially tells two stories. First, the INDCs do present a real increase in the levels of ambition compared to a projection of current policies; all global modelling analyses and scenarios based on country-specific data sources assessed, reached this conclusion. Secondly, however, the ambitions are far from sufficient, and the emissions gap in 2030 is very significant. Unless ambition is raised rapidly, the projected emission levels resulting from the INDCs are likely to lead to a path that at best will be consistent with an increase in global average temperature of below 3oC in 2100. If considering unconditional INDC levels only, the projected temperature increase is closer to below 3.5oC. Taking uncertainty ranges into account, the emission level estimates under full implementation of both unconditional and conditional INDCs become most consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3-3.5°C by the end of the century with >66 per cent chance.


4.1 Introduction
The INDCs represent a real increase in the level of mitigation ambition compared to a continuation of current policies. However, as Chapter 3 illustrates, even with combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs, the emissions gap in 2030 is estimated to be in the order of 12 GtCO2e.
The central question is then if and how this emissions gap can be narrowed and potentially bridged?
This second part of the Emissions Gap Report explores some of the answers to this question. Assessing the most recent literature, it sets off by providing an overview of key issues and opportunities for narrowing and potentially bridging the emissions gap in 2030 in this chapter. These opportunities include:
· Establishing a dynamic framework under the Paris Agreement to drive continuous strengthening of mitigation ambition and ensure efficient implementation of the agreement
· Boosting pre-2020 mitigation action to reduce mitigation costs, avoid lock-in and maintain a possibility of staying below 1.5°C by 2100
· Introducing, replicating and scaling up good practice mitigation action, enabling countries to overachieve on their INDCs and bring about a transition to a low carbon economy
· Full integration of development and climate cobenefits in policies, planning and action.
This is followed by 2 chapters providing in-depth assessment of opportunities to further tap into emission reduction potentials in one cross-cutting area, International Cooperative Initiatives (Chapter 5), and for one sector, forestry (Chapter 6).

4.2 Ensuring coherence, synergy and complementarity between climate change, economic growth and sustainable development
A deeper understanding and recognition of the interdependency between climate change, economic growth and sustainable development has emerged over the past decade. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently adopted in New York by Heads of State of all member states of the United Nations (UN, 2015a) (see also Chapter 1) are an exemplification of this recognition. The SDG process explicitly recommends prioritizing coherence, co-benefits, and complementarity between a climate change agreement under the UNFCCC and the SDGs.
The interrelationships between climate and development are demonstrated in the SDGs and the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014a, 2014b). Similarly linkages between economic growth, sustainable development and climate change are echoed across the recent literature (GGBP, 2014; Ansuategi et al., 2015; GCEC 2015a, 2015b; IEA, 2015a, 2015b). A briefing paper prepared for the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York earlier this year states that ""Progress towards many SDGs will be affected, overwhelmingly negatively, by climate change (for example food security, water scarcity and water related disasters, poverty and livelihoods, health, and the well-being of ocean and terrestrial ecosystems)"" (UN, 2015a, p.2). At the same time, ""[...] significant progress on many SDGs can contribute to tackling climate change (including sustainable energy, infrastructure and industrialization, sustainable consumption and production, sustainable agriculture and sustainable cities)"" (UN, 2015a, p.2).

Box 4.1: Preparation of the INDC in Chile
The preparation of the INDC has involved high level political responsibility starting with a political mandate from the President implemented by the Council of Ministers for Sustainability and Climate Change. In order to get both political engagement and input for consideration, the draft INDC was submitted for public consultation over a period of 4 months with public briefings throughout the country. Proposals received went into a revision process for the draft INDC and final decision rested with the Council. Mitigation discussion was focused around two possible emission intensity targets for the country with different implications but neither of them was seen as damaging to the economy. So climate change policies were treated, in effect, as an integral part of overall national development.

Box 4.2: Preparation of the INDC in the Gambia
The INDC of the Gambia comprehensively addresses mitigation and adaptation and relevant means for implementation like finance, technology and capacity building. The INDC process has been founded in the context of the regular national development planning process. The national INDC preparation process has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement with sensitization workshops in each of the eight districts of the country and broad cross ministerial and institutional engagement in the actual preparation of the national submission. As a small LDC the Gambia has limited mitigation potential but has identified a number of areas like renewable energy, forestry and agriculture where actions can be implemented - some domestically, others requiring international financial and technological support.

Similarly, the recent IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report states with high confidence that climate change poses a threat to equitable and sustainable development (IPCC, 2014a). However, the report also finds that it is possible to pursue strategies and actions that will move towards climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development, while simultaneously facilitating improved livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management (IPCC, 2014a).
The SDG Goal 13 ""Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"" specifically acknowledges that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change (UN, 2015b), and the targets associated with the Goal are clearly aligned with the ambitions in the INDCs. From the assessment of the submitted INDCs it is evident that many countries have established national processes that are explicitly anchored in an understanding of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the broader context of sustainable development planning at the national level (see Box 4.1 and 4.2).
4.3 A robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework under the Paris Agreement is vital to narrow the emissions gap
A robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework is critical to ensure the implementation of an ambitious global agreement on climate change. The SDG process has emphasized the importance of establishing a framework for periodic follow-up and review of progress towards implementation of the SDGs and mobilization of further action to accelerate implementation with a four-year interval (UN, 2015c).

A similar approach seems likely to feature in the Paris Agreement. As of 23 October 2015, the UNFCCC draft negotiating text includes mention of periodical global stocktakes of the implementation of the Paris Agreement guided by modalities to be adopted by a body under the new agreement at its first session1.
A dynamic approach of the Paris Agreement that enables countries to regularly review and strengthen their INDCs is consistently highlighted as essential to enhance mitigation ambition and narrow the emissions gap (GCEC, 2015a; IDDRI, 2015; IEA, 2015a; INDC Forum, 2015; Spencer et al., 2015). In this way it has been stressed that the first round of INDCs should be seen as the basis for a `virtuous circle' of rising ambition (IEA, 2015a), and as representing `floors rather than ceilings' to national ambition over the coming years (GCEC, 2015a).
In this context it is important to note that the social and political effects of the INDCs and the processes undertaken at national level transcend the aggregate effect they are estimated to have on total global GHG emission levels in 2025 and 2030. The preparation of the INDCs, has in many countries incentivized exploration of linkages between development and climate outcomes, and can be seen as a step towards a transition to a low carbon economy. As Figures 3.6 and 3.7 in Chapter 3 illustrate, in many cases the INDCs support a decoupling of economic growth and emissions growth, and reduce per capita emissions.
The Paris Agreement can support these national transitions and provide the framework for mobilization of the enhanced mitigation effort that is required to align national efforts with the global mitigation ambition indicated by the 2oC pathways.
Establishing a robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework as part of the Paris Agreement will be critical in this context.
The following sections look into the opportunities for further enhancing mitigation action to narrow and potentially bridge the emissions gap, which would support the transition towards a low carbon economy and facilitate overachievement of the emission reductions put forward in the INDCs.
4.4 Bridging the gap ­ realizing emission reduction potentials by 2020 and 2030
4.4.1 The critical role of boosting pre-2020 mitigation action
The importance of increasing pre-2020 mitigation action was underscored in Chapter 2. Reducing emissions compared to the current policy trajectories before 2020 will not only improve the chances for achieving the stringent emission reductions that are required after 2020 to limit warming to below 2°C by 2100. It will also reduce the costs of emission reductions, avoid lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure, and lower the risk associated with substantial dependence on negative emissions beyond 2050 to limit global warming to 2°C. In addition, as shown in Chapter 2, enhanced early action that goes beyond current policies would facilitate maintaining the option of limiting warming to below 1.5°C in 2100 (with a greater than 50 per cent chance).
Previous Emissions Gap Reports (UNEP, 2011, 2012, 2013) showed estimates of the aggregate emission reduction potential by sector by 20202. This potential was based on studies that assumed earlier and more stringent mitigation action than indicated by the current policy trajectory. As we get closer to 2020, it is no longer possible to realize the full 2020 emission reduction potential referred to in previous Emissions Gap Reports. One reason is that often there is a considerable time lag between the adoption of emission reducing policies and options, their implementation and the reaping of the associated emission reductions. In addition, failure to invest in best available technologies and options as early as possible constrains our ability, in the near-future, to reduce emissions in some sectors and cross-cutting areas, because of lock-in of higher-energy use and emission investments with long timeframes.
The size of the remaining emission reduction potential by 2020 is difficult to assess, as few comprehensive updated studies are available. However, three recent technical reports by the UNFCCC (2014a, 2014b, 2015) highlight that significant emission reduction potential by 2020 remains. These reports focus on the thematic areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; land use; urban environments; carbon dioxide capture, use and storage; and non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions. Another recent study finds that scaling up and replicating current good practices could, reduce global emissions by around

4.6 GtCO2e in 2020, if wide-spread and urgent action is undertaken (Fekete et al., 2015).
4.4.2 Reaping emission reduction potentials by 2030 to narrow and potentially bridge the gap
Extensive emission reduction potential by 2030
Looking beyond 2020, a number of recent studies and reports, including by the IPCC and leading international institutions, identify a significant emissions reduction potential by 2030 (IPCC, 2014b; IRENA, 2014; Fekete et al., 2015; GCEC, 2015a; IDDRI, 2015; IEA, 2015a; JRC, 2015; OECD/IEA/ NEA/ITF, 2015). Acknowledging that the methodologies, assumptions, scope and coverage of measures vary across these studies, they all document that tapping into unused emission reduction potential could narrow the emissions gap in 2030 considerably.
Specific examples are presented in Table 4.1 showing emission reduction opportunities by 2030 estimated by different studies, and how this potential relates to the gap assessment findings presented in Chapter 3. Only studies that allow comparison of emission reductions relative to the INDC case levels are included in the table. Several other recent studies show sizeable emission reduction potential in specific sectors or thematic areas, but cannot be directly compared to the 2030 baseline, current policy trajectory and INDC emission levels from Chapter 3 and are therefore not included in the table.
Taken together, the studies shown in Table 4.1 indicate that global GHG emissions could be further reduced in 2030 by between 5-12 GtCO2e (range: 3-13) relative to the emissions level resulting from implementation of the unconditional INDCs, and between 5-10 GtCO2e (range: 1-11) relative to the emissions level associated with implementation of the conditional INDCs. Such reductions would significantly narrow the emissions gap in 2030, which as previously stated is estimated at 14 GtCO2e (range: 12-17) for the unconditional INDC case, and at 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15), if both unconditional and conditional INDCs are implemented. Furthermore, the studies rely exclusively on implementation of proven technologies and policies.
There is considerable uncertainty associated with the emission reduction potential estimated in the studies included in Table 4.1. On the other hand, the studies do not cover all possible measures, thematic areas or sectors. The study by NCI, PBL and IIASA (Fekete et al., 2015), for example, excludes potential emission reductions in agriculture, parts of the transport and industrial sector, waste, and bunkers. Similarly, the IEA study only considers options for reducing energy-related CO2 emissions.
In other words the total technical and economic emission reduction potential in 2030 could very well be larger than indicated in the table. Other sources like the Fourth Assessment Report, AR4, of the IPCC (2007) provided an estimate of total emission reduction potential in 2030 of


Medium coverage.
Includes five energy-related measures: 1) Increasing energy efficiency in the industry, buildings and transport sectors; 2) Progressively reducing the use of the least-efficient coal-fired power plants and banning their construction; 3) Increasing investment in renewable energy technologies in the power sector from US$270 billion in 2014 to US$400 billion in 2030; 4) Gradual phasing out of fossil-fuel subsidies to endusers by 2030; and 5)Reducing methane emissions in oil and gas production.
Notes: It is not possible to indicate technical and economic potential for specific levels of marginal cost based on the information provided in the studies. a Median and range is indicated where possible. JRC (2015) and IEA (2015a, 2015b) do not provide uncertainty ranges. NCI, PBL, and IIASA (Fekete et al., 2015) provide a range indicating medians of two analyses, but no uncertainty ranges. b The New Climate Economy study (GCEC, 2015a) has baseline emissions in 2030 of 69 GtCO2e and indicate a total emission reduction potential of 21 (range: 16-26) GtCO2e compared to this baseline level. In the Table, the 2030 baseline emissions of 65 GtCO2e estimated in Chapter 3 are used. Therefore, the total emission reduction potential of the New Climate Economy study has been adjusted by -4 GtCO2e to be comparable to the Emissions Gap assessment. C IEA (2015a, 2015b) only considers CO2 emissions. As the studies do not indicate the projected energy-related CO2 emission share of global GHG emissions in 2030, the emission reduction calculations in the table are approximate, based on the assumption that global energy-related CO2 emissions will also account for roughly two-thirds of global GHG emissions in 2030. This study does not distinguish between unconditional and conditional INDCs. Therefore, only one estimate for the emission reduction compared to INDC is included in the Table.

23 GtCO2e (range: 16-31)3, which is in the order of magnitude required to bridge the gap in 2030. An update of the total emission reduction potential in 2030 is not available in the Fifth Assessment Report, AR5, of the IPCC (2014a, 2014b). However, updates for key sectors in AR5 indicate that emission reduction potentials in 2030 remain in the same order of magnitude as in the AR4 (IPCC, 2007).
For the industry sector overall, global mitigation potentials in 2030 of up to 8 GtCO2e are referenced in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b). For the transport sector, the emission reduction potential is assessed to be higher than reported in the AR4, with projected energy efficiency and vehicle performance improvements ranging from 30-50 per cent in 2030 relative to 2010 (IPCC, 2014a). Similarly, for the building sector, the AR5 reports that mitigation or energy saving potentials often go beyond 30 per cent up to even 60 per cent of the baseline

(IPCC, 2014b)4. Analyses have furthermore shown that ""[...] technological improvement keeps replenishing the potential for efficiency improvement, so that the potential for costeffective energy efficiency improvement has not been diminishing in spite of continuously improving standards"" (IPCC, 2014b).
Finally, for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU), emission reduction potential of supply-side measures is estimated to be 7.2-11 GtCO2e in 2030 (IPCC, 2014b)5.
The studies assessed all emphasize the key importance of enhanced energy efficiency, with a particular emphasis on industry, buildings and transport. Expanded use of renewable energy technologies for power production combined with increased efficiency of fossil fuel-based power production is also considered key. Other key areas and sectors for enhanced mitigation action emphasized in the studies include forestry, agriculture and waste. These are all areas that have been

assessed in earlier UNEP Emissions Gap Reports and where significant opportunities for bridging the gap have been highlighted through possibilities for replication, acceleration and scaling up proven good practices and policies.
The importance of scaling up good practices and policies
There is immense potential for reducing emissions through world-wide replication and scaling up of good practices and policies as illustrated above. However, the emission reduction

potentials shown in the previous sections can only be realized if strong, long-term and sector-specific policies are put in place at the global and national levels without delay.
Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2012, 2013, 2014) have demonstrated how proven policies can be scaled up (both in ambition and geographical reach) across countries and regions taking national differences and circumstances into account. Box 4.3 summarizes key proven policies in different areas considered in earlier Emissions Gap Reports.

Box 4.3: Summary of proven policies for reducing GHG emissions and achieving development goals highlighted in previous UNEP emissions gap reports (source: UNEP 2012, 2013, 2014)
The 2012, 2013 and 2014 UNEP Emission Gap Reports identify policies in key areas that have proven successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in many different countries, while contributing to national development goals. Such policies have the potential to make a significant contribution to bridging the gap, if scaled up in terms of ambition and geographical coverage.
Energy
These policies are related to improvements in energy efficiency in various sectors: · Building sector ­ Regulations for building energy performance or codes for new construction: especially with regards
to energy efficiency in heating, cooling appliances and lighting. Most developed countries also need to pay attention to renovating existing buildings in an energy efficient manner · Industry sector ­ Country- and subsector-specific approaches rather than standardized policies: due to the diverse nature of the industry sector target policies have proven most effective · Transport sector ­ Mandatory fuel economy standards for road vehicles: principal means for slowing down the growing fossil fuel consumption. Often supplemented with measure such as labelling, taxes and incentives, while promoting more efficient transportation modes · Appliance standards ­ Regulations that prescribe the energy performance of manufactured products · Appliance labels ­ Energy-efficiency labels that are fixed to manufactured products to describe the products' energy performance.
Agriculture
· Promotion of no-tillage practices · Improved nutrient and water management in rice production · Agroforestry: different agricultural management practices that all deliberately include woody perennials on farms
and the landscape, and which promote a greater uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by biomass and soils.
Buildings
Policies that lower energy use and therefore reduce carbon-dioxide and other emissions (see also under Energy): · Building codes: regulatory instruments that set standards for specific technologies or energy performance levels and
that can be applied to both new buildings and retrofits of existing buildings.
Transport
These policies reduce energy use and therefore reduce carbon dioxide and other emissions (see also under Energy): · Transit-oriented development: the practice of mixing residential, commercial and recreational land uses to promote
high-density neighbourhoods around public transit stations · Bus Rapid Transit (BRT): key elements of bus rapid transit include frequent, high-capacity service; higher operating
speeds than conventional buses; separated lanes; distinct stations with level boarding; and fare prepayment and unique branding · Vehicle performance standards: establish minimum requirements based on fuel consumption or greenhouse gas emissions per unit of distance travelled by certain vehicle classes.
The policies included above do not represent a comprehensive list. Moreover, some policies will be more appropriate and successful in reducing emissions in some countries than in others. Their success also depends on how stringently they are implemented.

Consideration of multiple benefits essential
Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report have emphasized that in many, if not most, cases climate change mitigation is not the primary driver for action, but rather a significant co-benefit of sound sectoral and national development planning and policies. The previous Emissions Gap Reports offer examples of how ambitious policy instruments that lead to significant emission reductions can foster innovation and economic growth, bolster national energy security, improve public health and address other key developmental priorities.
The feasibility of introducing, replicating or expanding ambitious regulatory measures, market- and price-based instruments, and command-and-control measures varies across thematic areas, sectors and countries (UNEP, 2012; IPCC, 2014b). In order to build a strong case for enhanced action by policy makers and other stakeholders, it will be important to provide clear and convincing documentation of the wide range of benefits associated with the implementation of the policies and actions that

can bring about the needed reductions of GHG emissions (UNEP, 2012).
Numerous studies confirm that many actions that reduce GHG emissions are associated with considerable co-benefits (IPCC, 2014a; Parry, et al., 2014; WB, 2014; Fekete et al., 2015; GCEC, 2015b; Höhne et al., 2015; UNFCCC, 2014a, 2014b, 2015). Accounting for co-benefits reduces the average cost of emission reduction options and increases the total emission reduction potential associated with a net benefit. For energy efficiency options, inclusion of multiple benefits in some cases triples the overall benefit of these options, notably where they heavily reduce coal use (GCEC, 2015b). Options associated with net costs, may also swing to net benefits when co-benefits are taken into account. This is, for example, the case for reduced deforestation, recycling of new waste, and offshore wind (GCEC, 2015b).
Full integration of co-benefits in planning and decisio-nmaking can thus have profound implications for climate and development action.

5.1 Introduction
The objective of this chapter is to provide an assessment based on published or readily available information of the possible contribution to global mitigation efforts especially by key International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs). In addition, the chapter looks into the role of other groups of non-state actors. In the context of climate mitigation, ICIs are considered to be cooperative efforts led by actors other than Parties to the UNFCCC, but many are undertaken in partnership with national governments whose agencies are very often critical to the realization of the ICIs' emission reduction potential. Many ICIs have strong international partners ­ catalyzing both national and international actions and often providing opportunity for enhancing national ambition.
Across this spectrum, ICIs cover a wide range of activities, and although it is a challenge to cover them comprehensively, an effort has been made to assess available information and prioritize initiatives according to their potential mitigation significance. The chapter starts by presenting the results of a number of recent studies regarding the potential emission reduction contribution of ICIs together with an assessment as to what extent ICI contributions can be considered as additional to those anticipated from the Cancun pledges. This is followed by an examination of the links between national level cooperative initiatives and the UNFCCC process, with examples from selected INDCs submitted during 2015. The chapter then presents a detailed overview of ICIs grouped into three categories, cities and regions, companies and sectors, which helps illustrate the innovative approaches adopted by many non-state actors and facilitate opportunities for identifying new types of partnerships that could contribute to addressing the mitigation challenge.
A particular effort has been made to examine south-south initiatives that may have been under-represented in past reviews. The chapter focuses on actions on the ground rather than enabling measures, as the former are more

quantifiable. Particular attention is given to private sector activities which, under favourable policy and legislative frameworks, strengthen technological innovation.
5.2 Quantitative impact of ICIs on emission reductions
An earlier estimate of the possible emissions reduction impact of ICIs was reported in the Emissions Gap Report 2013 (UNEP, 2013). This report stated a total expected impact of about 10 GtCO2e in 2020, based on a number of underlying studies (Blok et al., 2012; IEA, 2013; UNFCCC, 2013).
A number of recent studies have estimated both the gross emission reduction potential of ICIs for 2020 and 2030, and, for 2020, attempted to calculate net impacts additional to what will be included in the 2020 pledge achievement. These include a study carried out for UNEP by Ecofys (UNEP, 2015), a study by Yale University (Hsu et al., 2015) and a study by the Netherlands' Environmental Assessment Agency (Roelfsema et al., 2015). An overview of the results, broken down by sector is given in Table 5.4.
Although all studies have comparable methodologies (Mosteller and Hsu, 2015) and consider similar categories, there are marked differences in scope between the studies. UNEP (2015) started from all initiatives gathered on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015), and then selected the most significant ones for quantitative analysis. Commitments made at the New York Climate Summit in 2014 were not included because of their early stage of development. This summit sparked significant new engagement on climate action and a number of new ICI type commitments were presented (Climate Change Summary, 2014). Hsu et al. (2015) explicitly focus on these new commitments from the Climate Summit. Roelfsema et al. (2015) took a similar approach as the UNEP report, but the authors used a different baseline scenario. They also included major initiatives outside the UNFCCC framework (for example, those of national governments


under the Montreal Protocol). This is also the only study to project possible emission reduction contributions to 2030, partly through extrapolation. Findings from a further study (CISL/Ecofys, 2015) have been also been included in the assessment, even if the coverage was more restricted. These differences in scope and coverage indicate that the total impact of non-state climate action could be larger than reported by each individual study, as they do not fully overlap.
An overall conclusion of the assessment is that the impact of non-state climate commitments can be very significant, most likely in the range of 2.5-4 GtCO2e in 2020 (taking into account that not all initiatives are included in all assessments). This already accounts for an estimate of overlap between the various initiatives, in terms of actual actions, sectors, greenhouse gases and regions.
It is difficult to estimate the overlap between these nonstate initiatives and national government pledges for 2020.

Overlap between these varies from full overlap, for example for the Global Fuel Efficiency Initiative, to virtually no overlap, for example for the international marine and aviation sector (Roelfsema et al., 2015). For countries with economy-wide reduction pledges the overlap is hard to estimate, but likely to be larger, compared to the overlap for countries with very narrowly defined pledges limited to one or two particular sectors. Roelfsema et al. (2015) estimated the overlap for individual initiatives and country pledges and, by aggregating this to the global level, found a total of 70 per cent overlap between initiatives included and government pledges for the year 2020. In contrast, UNEP (2015) found a lower overlap of just 33 per cent at the maximum for the initiatives and country pledges included in their study. As shown in Table 5.1 below, these two key studies would suggest that the estimated range of emission reductions from ICIs net of the 2020 pledges is currently in the order of 0.75-2.2 GtCO2e in 2020.

It is important to recognize that the emission reduction impact of the initiatives assessed here assumes that the actors live up to their commitments. It is currently difficult to assess whether international initiatives actually deliver. Most initiatives put forward voluntary commitments which makes it difficult to enforce accountability and compliance. For some initiatives this leads to a lack of robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) (IVM, 2015). In practice, actors may over- or under-deliver compared to their commitments (see section 5.4.2 on delivery by companies). Although the 2013 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2013) quoted a non-state contribution of just under 10 GtCO2e/yr by 2020, this represented an acknowledged overlap with national pledges that was not quantified.
Beyond the possible direct mitigation contribution either as part of fulfilling government pledges or providing additional reductions, it is important to stress the possibilities for growth and acceleration of initiatives. A recent study (CISL/Ecofys, 2015) illustrates in several areas that there is significant potential for scaling up initiatives. The development and engagement of ICIs are rapidly evolving within all the different categories, therefore the results presented in this section must be seen as a snapshot of where ICIs stand today.
It would have been very interesting to assess the possible contribution from ICIs for 2030 and similarly, as with pledges, to examine how much of this contribution would be additional to the new INDCs. However, although PBL (Roelfsema et al., 2015) does offer an extrapolation of the total expected impact of ICIs in 2030 (midpoint estimate 5.5 GtCO2e), it is not feasible at this point to consider questions of 2030 additionality in any meaningful way.
5.3 Non-state actors and the UNFCCC process
In view of the importance of cooperative initiatives (often led by non-state actors) in low carbon development, some UNFCCC Parties and observers have called for better representation of their role in the UNFCCC process (Chan and Paux, 2014).
In December 2014 at the COP 20 in Lima, a new platform was launched to showcase climate mitigation initiatives as distinct from national pledges (NAZCA, 2015). The Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA) signifies a ""[...] symbolic step towards considering subnational and non-state actors within the political sphere of the UNFCCC"" (Hsu et al., 2015). The platform mainly promotes voluntary action and does not apply a standardised set of compliance, monitoring, reporting and verification rules. Although administered by the UNFCCC, data are primarily contributed by partner organisations and not collected by the UNFCCC itself.
The role of non-state actors has recently expanded due to the need to assist with INDC submissions of the UNFCCC Parties prior to COP 21 in Paris in December 2015. As pointed out by Edwards et al. (2015) ""[...] the INDC design process offers an unprecedented opportunity to improve civil society and business participation in climate change policymaking"".

Where some developing countries have lacked capacity, non-state actors have been able to assist. Both national and international NGOs have provided know how in connection with preparation of INDCs for different countries (for example, climateanalytics.org, energies2050.org).
Domestic non-state actors have also contributed to the national debate on INDCs. In Brazil, Observatório do Clima, a Brazilian coalition comprising more than 30 NGOs, has estimated annual GHG emissions estimates for Brazil since 2013. Even before the INDC process, the organization had already participated in domestic consultations led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Senegal, a non-governmental organization, Enda Energie, participated in the sectoral and national reports validation workshops and contributed to the preparation of scenarios used as the basis for the INDC18.
The contribution of non-state actors to climate mitigation actions will continue following the submission of INDCs. They can be instrumental not only in facilitating the achievement of the emission reduction targets, but also in monitoring, reporting and verification of actions at national level (Dodwell et al., 2015).
Some INDCs acknowledge the contribution of non-state actors. Mexico states that multiple stakeholders have been consulted during the INDC preparation, including NGOs specializing in adaptation. Interestingly, few INDCs have highlighted the role of non-state initiatives in mitigation. An exception is China, which plans to ""[...] conduct lowcarbon cities (towns) pilots as well as low-carbon industrial parks, low-carbon communities, low-carbon business and low-carbon transport pilots"" (UNFCCC, 2015). Indonesia mentions ""[...] active participation of the private sector, small and medium enterprises, civil society organizations, local communities and the most vulnerable groups [...]"" in sustainable forest management (UNFCCC, 2015).
5.4 Summary of Initiatives
This section presents a review of the recent literature on ICIs with a main focus on initiatives that have substantial mitigation potential. Various reports (Hale and Roger, 2014; Hsu et al., 2015; Roelfsema et al., 2015; Roger et al., 2015; UNEP, 2015) provide an overview of what has been announced or implemented by subnational governments, such as cities, municipalities and regions, company initiatives and initiatives with a specific sectoral focus. Descriptions of initiatives can be found on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015) and the NAZCA portal (NAZCA, 2015). Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements for the various initiatives is also assessed, as this is a key element in providing transparency and ensuring credibility. The ICIs considered are grouped into three categories, cities and regions, companies and sectors.
5.4.1 Cities and regions initiatives
Subnational governments can act on climate change mitigation in many ways. Sub-national jurisdictions, such as state or regional governments, have even attempted to

compensate for the lack of political will at the national level (Somanathan et al., 2014).
There are many ICIs in which several cities and regions cooperate; for example, UNEP's recent report on subnational actors lists twenty one initiatives of this type (UNEP, 2015). A few started in the 1990s19, while the majority started in the period 2005-201220 and some were announced during the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit in September 201421. Initiatives focus on the following roles:
· Encouraging or facilitating emission reductions at the city and regional level, via knowledge sharing, capacity building and technical support for project planning and implementation
· Identifying partnerships and supporting local communities to become climate resilient
· Representing common city-level interests to influence policymakers at other levels
· Helping implement climate plans and low-carbon and climate-resilient economic development projects
· Achieving transparency and accountability by encouraging best practice in GHG emission reporting
· Helping overcome financial barriers and attract investors and accelerate additional capital flows into cities for low carbon projects.
The overview identifies those cities and regions initiatives with members who have committed to GHG emission reductions. In most cases they have (or plan to have) inventories or registries to report both their goals and their past and current GHG emissions, with the aim of promoting transparency and accountability. The following initiatives fall into this category: C40, carbonn (including Mexico City Pact and WWF Earth Hour City Challenge), Covenant of Mayors, Climate Group's States and Regions, Compact of Mayors and Compact of States and Regions (see Table 5.2). There is an overlap in membership between some of these various initiatives.
Monitoring, reporting and verification
The Covenant of Mayors provides European local governments with guidance on how to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). Once this is adopted, implementation towards the goal is monitored. As of July 2015, about 460 monitoring reports were available from 2 882 adopted SEAPs. C40 cities reporting via the CDP22 are asked to report using the primary protocol standard or methodology to calculate GHG emissions (for example, 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC) (WRI, C40 and ICLEI, 2014)).

Cities participating in the Compact of Mayors are requested to use the Global Protocol for Community-scale GHG emissions (GPC) and they are also required within 3 years to submit a climate action plan which includes an implementation and monitoring plan.
The cities and regions initiatives generally have designated registries (see Table 5.2). In the case of the newer initiatives such as the Compact of Cities and Compact of States and Regions, signatories have the choice of reporting to the carbonn Climate Registry or CDP. In addition to reporting on GHG emissions, signatories are requested to advise which GHG protocol and emissions factors were applied. The Compact of Mayors requires a complete updated inventory every three years23. Annual reports or summaries are published by the initiatives or the reporting platform. These include the total planned emission reductions and often the base year of emissions, without specifying the current progress towards the emission reduction targets. Such information is currently only publicly available for a limited number of cities such as those under the Covenant of Mayors.
The cities that disclose their information to CDP also provide information on whether or not their GHG emissions inventory has been verified by a third party. While the SEAPs that are submitted to the Covenant of Mayor are subject to verification by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, the monitoring progress reports available for certain cities on the website do not indicate that they are third party verified. Participating authorities to the CDP States and Regions platform will be asked to report whether data sources have been verified.
It is evident from the assessment of cities and regions initiatives that there are a number of different approaches to especially monitoring and reporting and generally limited independent verification. Recent development indicates that the initiatives are gradually building the necessary processes and moving towards more uniform approaches.
cCR is not only an initiative itself, but also the reporting platform for two other initiatives: The Global Cities Covenant on Climate ­ The Mexico City Pact and WWF Earth Hour City Challenge. It is designated as the central repository of the Compact of Mayors and the Compact of States and Regions. Led by ICLEI.
The CoM is a group of city mayors, mostly from the EU, who commit to meet and exceed the EU CO2 emission reduction target of 20% by 2020 (from a 1990 baseline).
Participating cities commit to 10 voluntary action points, including reduction of their local GHG emissions, adoption of mitigation measures to achieve their targets and reporting of their emissions and targets. Established by the World Mayors Council on Climate Change.
The EHCC aims to showcase diverse solutions and challenges for cities in different parts of the world and to identify options for collaboration between these cities. Established by WWF.


Annual reporting to Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) (concerning GHG emissions, plus risk and adaptation, policies/plans and goals, latest emissions from local government operations and community emissions, water supply) states whether data is externally verified or not. Publishes annual cities report that summarizes climate risks and adaptation and specific C40 research.
In December 2014, C40, WRI and ICLEI launched the Global Protocol for Community-scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) to support cities to develop robust, comprehensive and consistent inventories.

Description
The Alliance brings together 27 subnational government leaders to share expertise, demonstrate impact and influence the international climate dialogue. In 2005 representatives of the local governments signed the Montreal Declaration of Federated States and Regions, in which they commit to setting targets and implementing climate action in their own jurisdictions. Led by the Climate Group.
The Compact is an agreement by 3 city networks, including ICLEI, and then by their members, to undertake a transparent and supportive approach to reduce city-level emissions, and to reduce vulnerability from, and enhance resilience to, climate change, in a consistent and complementary manner to national level climate protection efforts. It builds on the ongoing city-level efforts.
The Compact represents a commitment by global state and regional government networks to provide an annual assessment of commitments (that is, GHG reduction targets), and progress towards those commitments (that is, GHG inventory data).
5.4.2 Companies initiatives
Another set of ICIs engage private sector companies in mitigation activities. A total of 30 such initiatives are currently listed on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015). Many of these initiatives act more as convening platforms for exchange of best practice and advocacy than engaging in direct commitments. But some have objectives that indirectly lead to emission reduction, for example, those aiming to re-direct investment to clean energy.
An overview of companies' initiatives that focus on direct GHG emission reduction is provided in Table 5.3. One common characteristic, of the initiatives with considerable potential for emission reductions (UNEP, 2015), is the requirement for participating companies to set their own emission reduction commitments. The most recent climate initiative assessed in this chapter, the Science Based Target Initiative which was launched in 2014, requests participating companies to set targets that are compatible with a global 2°C goal (CDP, WRI and WWF, 2014).
There is a trend towards more collaboration between different kinds of partners. Most private sector companies' initiatives have up to 50 member companies, while others like the Caring for Climate Initiative has over 380 signatories.
Monitoring, reporting and verification
Among companies initiatives, members of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) use the Cement CO2 and Energy Protocol, while others reporting via CDP routinely use The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The Caring for Climate companies are recommended to use CDP's reporting process on an annual basis. Other alternatives are the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and the Global Compact Advanced Communication on Progress (COP).

Annual reports or summaries are published by the various initiatives or reporting platforms, covering total planned emission reductions and often the base year of emissions, without specifying the current progress towards the emission reduction targets.
The companies that disclose their information to the CDP, report whether their information on GHG emissions has been verified, whether assurance is still underway or whether no third party verification took place. The annual reports of Caring for Climate are self-assessed. The overall picture on MRV for company initiatives is, therefore, quite similar to that for cities and regions though with variation in approach and limited evidence of verification at present.
Progress towards goals
An important question is to what extent companies are on track to reach their goals. According to their Progress Report (Caring for Climate, 2014), which lists both large companies and SMEs, a subsample of 33 large companies with high quality data for 2012 and 2013 demonstrated a decrease in GHG emission levels of around 13 per cent against 2007 levels. However, the CDP Carbon Action Report 2014 (CDP, 2014) suggests that more than half of the companies in its sample did not set absolute targets and a quarter of absolute targets ended in the reporting year. The report notes that 70 per cent of the correctly set absolute targets by companies ""[...] will not be achieved in a business-as-usual scenario and further action will be required"" (CDP, 2014, p.12).

Almost all companies of the Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC), the majority of WWF Climate Savers and CSI26 companies, and half of the participating companies of Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) initiative self-report to CDP by means of a questionnaire. The information related to supply chain or climate change reported to CDP as part of their corporate disclosure can be viewed by registered users. The company can choose via the CDP Platform, whether their disclosure is available to registered users and whether their submission is scored. The Caring for Climate companies should annually report by means of a Communication on Progress-Climate (COPClimate), which is available via the initiative's website27.

CSI is an alliance of 25 leading companies in the global cement industry created under the auspices of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Participants commit to developing a climate change mitigation strategy, setting reduction targets for CO2 and reporting annually on their progress.
WWF Climate Savers is for companies seeking to substantially reduce their carbon footprints. Each participant sets a reduction target in absolute terms and within a defined timeframe.
ULCOS is a consortium of 48 European companies and organisations from 15 European countries. The aim of the ULCOS programme is to reduce the CO2 emissions of today's leading steel production routes by at least 50%.
Caring for Climate is an initiative aimed at advancing the role of business in addressing climate change. Participants commit to set voluntary targets to improve energy efficiency and to reduce their carbon footprint.
A joint initiative by CDP, the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and WWF launched in 2014, aiming to increase corporate ambition on climate action consistent with limiting global warming to less than 2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures.
Aim of the initiative is for at least 100 companies to make a global 100% renewable commitment with a clear timeframe for reaching their goal. RE100 considers as `renewable' the electricity generated from biomass (including biogas), geothermal, solar, water and wind energy sources (see RE100 criteria).
5.4.3 Sector initiatives
Sector initiatives are grouped around renewable energy, energy efficiency, industrial processes, low carbon transport, land restoration and reforestation, and marine energy. There is a clear likelihood of overlap between the sector initiatives and the other categories (cities and regions, and companies), but recent estimates indicate this overlap to be relatively small ­ less than 10 per cent ­ in the region of 0.21 GtCO2e/yr by 2020 on a total impact range of 2.5-3.3 GtCO2e/yr by 2020 (UNEP, 2015). Table 5.4 identifies principal sector-led initiatives.
5.5 The private sector and innovation in mitigation
Looking beyond ICIs, the private sector is engaged in a wide range of climate activities that have the potential to reduce carbon intensity in many economies (Vergara et al., 2015). Acknowledging the critical role of favourable policy and regulatory frameworks, the private sector is instrumental for

innovation, as innovation stems from technology advances, often through new economic and financial opportunities, and market-based risk-taking undertaken by the private sector. Selected examples include:
· Renewable energy, which has seen annual investments grow between 2004-2014 by 500 per cent from US$45 billion to US$270 billion (FS UNEP Centre, 2015) partially as a result of significant reductions in capital and operation and maintenance costs. For example, PV utility-size costs have been consistently falling at 22 per cent per year since 1976 (Seba, 2014). Capital costs for wind energy have also seen substantial decreases (IRENA, 2015). This pace of change is already affecting how new capacity is being planned and has the potential to bring substantive additional changes in the power generation market in the near future
· Deployment of distributed power, which has the ability to shift modes of generation and transmission from

Mitigation potential from forest-related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries
6.1 Introduction
Forest-related mitigation activities in both developing and developed countries represent important opportunities for climate change mitigation, and enhanced action on these activities could contribute significantly to narrowing the emissions gap. The IPCC AR5 (Smith et al., 2014) highlights that 12 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (in the period 2000-2009) come from forests and other land use change. Forests hold large carbon stores within their living biomass (above and below ground), in dead organic matter (litter/dead wood) and in soil. Enhanced mitigation action could involve enhancing carbon stocks in new or existing forests, changes to forest management, and increased reforestation and afforestation.

forest-related activities in developing countries to bridging the emissions gap in 2030; and the role REDD+ can play as a key instrument to realize these reductions.
6.2 Global overview of forest-related mitigation engagement
Countries are already committing to substantial efforts towards forest-related mitigation. To date a total of 109 countries (counting the EU as one), including 94 developing countries1, have made statements regarding their willingness to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or to enhance forest carbon stocks. Figure 6.1 provides a global overview of these national statements2 that are made in a range of different texts and fora including:

This chapter starts by providing a global overview of existing statements regarding intended forest-related mitigation actions by countries, including in their INDCs. This is followed by a review of the range of available forest-related mitigation options. International multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the New York Declaration on Forests and the Bonn Challenge on forest landscape restoration have focused on ambitious global objectives for the sector. Over the last ten years, there has also been considerable effort and progress under the UNFCCC in negotiating the set of policy approaches and interventions known as REDD+ (reducing GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, `plus' conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks), which is considered a key option under the UNFCCC for facilitating specific cost-effective contribution to climate change mitigation in developing countries (Eliasch, 2008; UNFCCC, 2009).
Reflecting the political interest in REDD+, the chapter has a special focus on assessing the potential contribution of carbon dioxide emissions reductions and sequestration from

Box 6.1: Forest-related mitigation in INDCs
Countries that have submitted INDCs describe their forest-related activities in a variety of different ways (see also Chapter 3). Some countries mention that the forest sector is relevant, but do not provide any quantification. Some specify conditional and unconditional contributions without indicating how these are attributed to forests. Some examples of the types of statements in the INDCs are:
· Democratic Republic of Congo: the INDC presents a 17 per cent emissions reduction contribution entirely conditional on finance, and achieved through agriculture, forestry and energy sectors. Forestry activities will focus mainly on afforestation and reforestation
· Ethiopia: the INDC presents a quantified target for mitigation in the forestry sector of 130 MtCO2 through protecting and re-establishing forests and increasing carbon stocks, fully conditional on international support
· Brazil: the INDC presents an unconditional economy-wide emissions reduction for 2025. Specifically in the forest sector, implementation and permanence of REDD+ activities require the provision, on a continuous basis, of adequate and predictable results-based payments in accordance with the relevant COP decisions.

INDCs. The forest-related mitigation potential under the INDCs will be less than this, as forestry comprises a subset of LULUCF activities described in the INDCs. The following sections put these numbers into a broader context of forest-related mitigation opportunities and potentials.
6.3 Forest-related mitigation opportunities
Forest-related mitigation opportunities include maintaining or increasing forest areas and carbon density through reducing deforestation and degradation, afforestation or reforestation, or forest management to increase stand- and landscape-level carbon density (Nabuurs et al., 2007).
Best practice policies to curb deforestation were reviewed in the 2012 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2012). This report highlighted four distinct policy categories, including:
· Establishing new protected areas · Using command-and-control measures (enacting,
enforcing and monitoring of regulations on conversion of forest, may include investment in existing protected areas to prevent incursion (Scharlemann et al., 2010)) · Using economic instruments (taxes, subsidies, payments for ecosystem services), and · Creating policies affecting drivers and contexts that currently promote deforestation (sectoral policies, institutional frameworks, governance structures and agricultural subsidy reform).
Addressing the drivers of deforestation is critical. On-the-ground measures to reduce pressure on forests include sustainable intensification of agriculture to improve yields on existing land, and alternative livelihoods development for communities dependent on deforestation. Designating new protected areas, indigenous lands and community-managed forests can be effective in preventing deforestation in situ3 and avoiding its displacement to other areas. However, forest-related mitigation approaches are generally found to be more effective if they also address the direct and indirect drivers of land-use change (Ewers and Rodrigues, 2008). Combinations of policies and measures that work at the landscape scale to reduce the drivers of deforestation, whilst identifying and protecting the most valued forests, are most likely to yield multiple benefits (New Climate Economy, 2015).
Reducing degradation and promoting enhancement of forest carbon stocks can also benefit from policies ranging from incentives for best practice to actions to address drivers (for example, fire and unsustainable harvesting). Sustainable forest management can reduce emissions from forest degradation through specific policies and measures, including adoption of reduced-impact logging in areas designated as production forest; prevention of illegal logging; planting of woodlots for poles or charcoal; promotion of more sustainable extraction and efficient use of fuelwood and charcoal; and support to community forestry and development of systems to limit the spread of anthropogenic fires such as those used in agriculture.

Enhancing carbon stocks may involve afforestation or reforestation, with approaches ranging from assisted natural regeneration to tree planting. In areas of disturbed forest, carbon stocks may be enhanced by controlling the degradation drivers covered above and by direct interventions, for example, through enrichment planting (Paquette et al., 2009) or rewetting of drained peatland forest (Jaenicke et al., 2010). Enhancing carbon stocks is one goal among many in the process known as forest landscape restoration, which aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes to meet present and future needs, whilst accommodating multiple uses over time (Maginnis et al., 2012). Forest landscape restoration may involve planting trees on farms, woodlots or agroforestry systems, or establishing new areas of forests to restore and recreate the structure, function and composition of an original forest ecosystem, or both (Lamb and Gilmour, 2003).
Conserving, restoring and sustainably managing forests offers numerous benefits other than carbon storage, strengthening the case for prioritizing forest-related mitigation options. Forests provide essential ecosystem goods and services, such as water quality and regulation (providing more consistent flows of clean water for drinking and agriculture), erosion control (preventing sedimentation of hydropower dams, and protecting other lands downstream), forest products (directly supporting livelihoods, for example through timber, fuelwood, foods, medicine and fibre) and cultural services (supporting cultural traditions and tourism) (Shvidenko et al., 2005). Hence, well-chosen and implemented forest-related mitigation activities can contribute to many other domestic and international policy objectives, including those defined in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets (CBD, 2010), the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 13 on urgent climate action and Goal 15 including to halt deforestation by 2020) (UNGA, 2015), the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN, 2008), the UNCCD 10-year strategic plan and framework (UNCCD, 2007) and the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests (UNGA, 2007). Synergies between adaptation and mitigation also exist in many cases and can, for example, be achieved through ecosystem-based adaptation (Rizvi et al., 2015). Furthermore, forest-related mitigation opportunities are integral to landscape-level mitigation approaches, and complement actions to reduce emissions from agricultural land4 and from non-forested peatlands (Smith et al., 2014).
The variety of forest-related mitigation opportunities presented here demonstrates the potential for broad participation by countries in forest-related mitigation according to their national circumstances. Drivers of lan-duse change, potential for restoration, and climate impacts on forest ecology among many other factors will differ between countries and regions, and determine the appropriate forest-related mitigation activities.

6.4 Emission reduction potential of forest-related mitigation activities
The previous sections provided a global overview of countries' intentions regarding forest-related mitigation activities and illustrated the wide range of areas in which such activities can be undertaken. In addition, the estimated LULUCF mitigation contribution in the INDCs was highlighted. While acknowledging the importance of reducing forest-related emissions in all countries, the political interest and emphasis given to REDD+ as a key instrument to realizing forest-based emission reductions reflects the critical role of developing countries in reducing emissions from deforestation.
This section assesses the total potential contribution to bridging the emissions gap in 2030 that could be brought about by forest-related emission reductions in developing countries. More specifically, the section assesses the technical potential for reducing emissions through forest-related activities in developing countries based on a review of the published literature. The technical potential represents the full biophysical potential of a mitigation option without accounting for economic or other constraints (as defined in Smith et al., 2014, p. 847). It represents a halt of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation including on peatland, and universal `wide-scale' forest restoration on available and suitable areas. This represents an upper technical maximum and is estimated to be around 9 GtCO2 in 2030 (range: 6.7-11.9) (Table 6.1).
Achieving the technical mitigation potential of the forest sector is limited by operational and socio-economic factors. Factors that can place increased demands on forest land include limited capacity to increase production in agriculture, national objectives for food self-sufficiency, infrastructure development, and wood product requirements. Demands can be reduced by factors such as restoring degraded lands to agricultural production, changing dietary preferences or reducing waste. Hence, country goals for forest-related emission reductions and enhancement of carbon stocks need to take into account potential competition with other land uses.
6.4.1 Technical mitigation potential of reducing carbon dioxide emissions
A wide range of estimates of global CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation exist (Ciais et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014). The range reflects uncertainty in data sources, use of different methodologies to estimate emissions, and differences in the land use change processes included, the range of emission sources included and the land-cover definitions adopted (Houghton et al., 2012). For example, the forest definitions used in international analyses are frequently based on those used by FAO's Global Forest Resources Assessment (forest area >0.5 ha, tree height >5 m and canopy cover >10 per cent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ, not predominantly under agricultural or urban use) (IPCC, 2006; FAO, 2010a). However, national forest definitions vary widely in terms of thresholds for canopy cover and tree height, and land uses included (Sasaki and Putz, 2009), meaning that vegetation types such as savannas, agroforestry systems, and mangroves may or

may not be addressed by forest policies, depending on the country. Differences in definition, not only of land cover types but also land-use change processes, influence both the overall estimated mitigation potential and whether certain emissions result from deforestation or from forest degradation (Romijn et al., 2013).
To estimate the technical mitigation potential of reducing deforestation and degradation and enhancing forest management in 2030 (second and third columns of Table 6.1), recent emissions given by published studies (referenced below the table) are used to approximate future emissions, assuming no further forest-related mitigation action. The business-as-usual scenarios in Clarke et al. (2014) suggest that total emissions from AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land use) may remain stable or decline, as they assume a slowing of population growth and increased efficiencies of food production that will contribute to reducing deforestation. Emissions from forest degradation in non-Annex I countries have declined marginally from 1.1 GtCO2/yr in 2001-2010 to 1 GtCO2/yr in 2011-2015, but the relative emissions from degradation compared to deforestation have increased from a quarter to a third (Federici et al., 2015). Indeed, in scenarios that consider increased reliance on biofuels for energy generation and climate mitigation, demand for agricultural land continues to grow. Bottom-up assessments of drivers also suggest that pressures will increase (Kissinger et al., 2012). For example, emissions from deforestation in the Congo basin are expected to increase in the future, with average annual deforested area between 2020 and 2030 varying amongst policy scenarios from 0.4 to 1.3 million ha (Megevand, 2013). Hence, the technical mitigation potential from reduced deforestation and forest degradation and enhanced forest management are estimated at 5.2 GtCO2/yr (range: 2.1-6.3), and may be a relatively conservative approximation of total potential, assuming that emissions from these sources are likely to continue at present levels or increase.
In the two decades up to 2010, tropical deforestation emissions have been found to represent around 98 per cent of reported deforestation emissions from non-Annex I countries5. Therefore tropical deforestation derived from published studies (Harris et al., 2012; Achard et al., 2014) has been used to approximate the technical potential for reduced deforestation in developing countries, which amounts to between 1.7-4.7 GtCO2/yr, with a mean of 3.4 GtCO2/yr (Table 6.1).
Forest degradation in non-Annex I countries, including the effects of selective logging, fire or drought, and fuelwood harvest, accounts for around 1 GtCO2/yr (between 2011-2015 (Federici et al., 2015)), which is very similar to the results found by Grace et al. (2014) for 2000-2012 of a mean of 1 GtCO2/yr (range: 0.3-1.7). In addition, emissions from drainage and fire in forested or deforested peatlands in Southeast Asia were estimated at a mean of 0.8 GtCO2/yr (drainage in 2006, fire 1998-2009 (Smith et al., 2014, Box 11.1)). Therefore the total
technical potential of reducing degradation and enhancing forest management would equal 1.8 GtCO2/yr.
6.4.2 Technical mitigation potential of enhanced carbon sequestration
As noted, increased sequestration, or enhanced removals, of carbon can result from increasing forest area, or through enhancing sequestration in existing forest (for example, rehabilitating degraded forest). When tree density increases, carbon is removed from the atmosphere by the increasing plant biomass, and soil carbon stocks are protected from erosion and may also increase.
Reforestation can take place at a variety of scales, from increasing tree cover in small areas within a mosaic of other land uses (so called `mosaic restoration') to restoring larger areas (`wide-scale' restoration, see Glossary). The estimated global potential for `wide-scale' restoration of closed-canopy forest is up to half a billion ha, excluding areas in intensive use (WRI, 2011)6. An additional 1.5 billion ha globally may have the potential for mosaic restoration (WRI, 2011). Mosaic restoration may be easier to undertake as it allows a greater range of land uses, whilst restoring areas to closed-canopy forest is likely to remove more CO2 per unit of area. Depending on ecosystem type, and whether the result is a natural forest or a plantation, areas converted to forest are estimated to remove between about 1 and 35 tCO2 per ha per year in above- and below-ground biomass (from default data in IPCC (2006)7). If natural forest were simultaneously restored over the 351 million ha with potential for wide-scale

restoration in non-Annex I countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean regions, calculated from WRI (2011), this could equate to 3.8 GtCO2/yr while the forest was re-growing.
Standing, secondary and planted forests also contribute to the global `terrestrial carbon sink', absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. The forest carbon sink is estimated to be large and vary widely, from a global value of 3.4 ± 1 GtCO2/yr (for the period 2001-2010 (Federici et al., 2015)), to estimates for tropical sinks alone of 6.8 GtCO2/yr (for the period 2005-2010 (Grace et al., 2014)). The IPCC states with high confidence that increased atmospheric CO2 will lead to increased terrestrial carbon uptake (Ciais et al., 2013), and a recent review suggests that the largest increase has been in woody biomass within savanna (included in some national forest definitions) and non-forest ecosystems (Liu et al., 2015). Carbon sink figures for existing forests are not included in the technical potential for reduced deforestation given here, as a result of the uncertainty surrounding how carbon sinks and their capacity to absorb CO2 will change in the changing climate (Bellassen and Luyssaert, 2014).
6.4.3 Economic mitigation potential of forest-related mitigation
A number of recent studies estimate the global economic mitigation potential in 2030 of various forest-related activities given economic and land-use constraints, at different levels of costs and for different regions of the world.

Notes to Table 6.1: a Achard et al. (2014), Table 2: annual carbon losses from gross loss of tropical forest cover (>30% cover) and other wooded land (<30% cover) for 2000-2010. Three
estimates from Achard study (Ecozone/IPCC, max and min Saatchi). Tropical regions: Central and South America, Africa, Southeast Asia. b Harris et al. (2012), Table 1: WHRC and Winrock team's estimates of gross carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, 2000-2005. Tropical regions: Sub-saharan Africa,
Latin America, South and Southeast Asia. Only forest biomass carbon stocks. c Grace et al. (2014), Table 5: estimated annual degradation flux from tropical degradation, 2000-2012. Tropical regions: Africa, America, Asia. d Total technical potential for degradation includes peatland degradation. Emissions from drainage (in 2006 according to Hooijer et al., 2010 in Smith et al., 2014) and fire
in forested or deforested peatlands in Southeast Asia (lower estimate for 1998-2009, Box 11.1 in Smith et al., 2014). e Afforestation and reforestation, including any expansion of forest area (see section 6.3). f Calculated for this chapter as: area of wide-scale restoration potential WRI (2011) in different FAO ecological zones (FAO, 2012) for non-Annex I countries in UNEP region
codes (excluding Europe and West Asia), multiplied by net annual CO2 uptake based on IPCC (2006) [annual net above + below-ground biomass growth, for natural forest in each ecological zone]/ [biomass to carbon conversion factor = 0.47] * [carbon to CO2 conversion factor = 3.67]. This figure is greater than the maximum estimate of 3.4 GtCO2 for the similar area of 350 million hectares at 2030 by Wolosin (2014); however that analysis was not restricted to non-Annex I countries and averages over restoration scenarios that include a large proportion of mosaic restoration and improved secondary and naturally regenerated forest, of which will result in a lower
average biomass growth per hectare. Use of the IPCC biomass growth figures for plantation forest would yield a still higher estimate. Single source, no range.

They offer a very large range of estimates of global mitigation potential at different cost levels, ranging from 0-1.5 GtCO2e for costs <US$20/tCO2e, to mitigation potentials of 0.1-9.5 GtCO2e for costs <US$50/tCO2e, and ranging from 0-13.8 GtCO2e for costs <US$100/tCO2e (Smith et al., 2014). Differences among models reviewed include the cost levels used, the economic assumptions, model approach (bottomup or top-down), and the mitigation options considered. The economic mitigation potential for developing countries is not provided separately. However, it is highlighted that for developing countries the most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are reducing deforestation, sustainable forest management and afforestation (Nabuurs et al., 2007). Regional breakdowns show that reduced deforestation dominates as the most cost-effective forestry option for Latin America and Middle East and Africa regions, whereas forest management dominates the Asia region (Smith et al., 2014).
In general, the economic mitigation potential will be smaller than the technical potential. Furthermore, estimates of economic mitigation potential do not consider policy incentives and socio-cultural and institutional barriers to implementation of forest-related mitigation activities (Smith et al., 2014), which further affect in either direction the extent to which emission reduction potentials are realized.
Real-world examples of how the results of full-scale realisation of forest mitigation policies might compare to these economic mitigation potentials are limited. Nevertheless, Brazil's success in reducing deforestation by 82 per cent in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2014 (INPE, 2015) results from a mix of policies that included expansion of protected areas, supply chain interventions, and positive incentives for landholders (Nepstad et al., 2014) as well as exogenous economic factors such as falling commodity prices (Assunção et al., 2015). This emphasizes the role of socio-cultural, institutional and policy-related contexts for realising forest-related emission reductions.

Nonetheless, the previous sections have indicated that there is significant potential to further reduce forest-related emissions, both compared to current practices and to the contributions indicated in the submitted INDCs. The last section of this chapter focuses on REDD+ as a key option under the UNFCCC for further enhancing forest-related mitigation in developing countries.
6.5 REDD+ as a key instrument to realize forest-related emission reductions in developing countries
The immediate and relatively large impact of preserving carbon through reducing deforestation and degradation, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this land use option compared to other mitigation measures (Golub et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014) has driven the momentum behind development of the REDD+ mechanism. Originally recognizing the contribution of ""reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries"" (`RED') (UNFCCC, 2005), the scope was expanded in 2007 to include emissions from degradation and became a component of enhanced action on mitigation (`REDD') (UNFCCC, 2007). In 2009 REDD+ was further expanded to include ""conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks"" (`REDD+') (UNFCCC, 2009) and now represents a specific suite of forest-related mitigation activities in the developing world (see Box 6.2) that countries can implement voluntarily to contribute to the global mitigation effort. Since 2005, the REDD+ framework has evolved under the UNFCCC, adapting to improved understanding of issues regarding potential impacts, methodological accounting, safeguards, and financing (Smith et al., 2014).
At COP 16 in Cancun in 2010, a phased approach to REDD+ was decided ""[...] beginning with the development of national strategies or action plans, policies and measures, and capacity-building, followed by the implementation of

national policies and measures and national strategies or action plans that could involve further capacity-building, technology development and transfer and results-based demonstration activities, and evolving into results-based actions that should be fully measured, reported and verified"" (UNFCCC, 20108). This was to provide a progressive pathway to full-scale REDD+ implementation, taking into account the differing capacities of countries.
Moreover, interventions at the national level are needed to overcome internal displacement of pressures from one area to the next. For this to happen, nationally coordinated cross-sectoral strategies are required, and should be based on an analysis of the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and barriers to the sustainable management of forest and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. National, and often, subnational institutions need to be mandated, resourced and have the capacity to implement these strategies. Safeguards need to be promoted and supported - to protect or enhance the many social and environmental values of forest, to respect the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and member of local communities, and to enable the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities. A robust and transparent national forest monitoring system is also required, enabling consistency in data and information to support the implementation of REDD+ activities (UN-REDD Programme, 2013).
Each of these pre-requisites to successful implementation is reflected in a series of decisions made under the 2013 Warsaw Framework on REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2013), which made significant progress on deciding on the coordination of financing, transparency and safeguards, development of national forest monitoring systems, verification at the international level, institutional arrangements to receive results-based finance, and action on drivers of deforestation (UNFCCC, 20139). To access results-based payments for REDD+ activities, actions need to be fully measured, reported and verified. To this end, countries need to have in place:
· A national strategy or action plan, · A national forest monitoring system (or interim
subnational system), · A safeguards information system and a summary of
information on how the REDD+ safeguards have been addressed and respected, and · A forest reference emission level or forest reference level (or interim subnational reference level).
The contribution of REDD+ to meeting the potential for forest-related mitigation is partly contingent on available resources, first to put these requirements in place and to develop enabling policy frameworks and institutional capacity to implement them (sometimes referred to as `REDD+ readiness'), and later to supply the financing that

creates positive incentives for enhanced results-based action on mitigation by developing countries10.
The series of decisions made under the 2013 Warsaw Framework on REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2013) has been accompanied by an ongoing and diverse set of early action REDD+ activities and other multilateral, bilateral or country driven initiatives being implemented that contribute to REDD+ readiness or complement the goals of REDD+ (for example, conservation and sustainable forest management).
Despite the complexities that have slowed REDD+ implementation on the ground (Sills et al., 2014), REDD+ is seen as a unique approach to better integrate the forest sector in the broader climate change and sustainable development plans of developing countries. Indeed, support to REDD+ readiness actions offers national benefits to many countries, including the development of national forest monitoring systems, understanding of drivers of deforestation, the strengthening of policies, laws and regulations relevant to the UNFCCC's REDD+ safeguards, the adoption of wider stakeholder engagement in decision-making, and development of better data and information on the distribution of forest carbon stocks, biodiversity and ecosystem services (Lee and Pistorius, 2015). It involves implementing policies and measures that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, are based on positive incentives for action, and can deliver additional co-benefits. Hence, REDD+ continues to receive political support from many developed and developing countries.
Some major constraints on the potential for REDD+ implementation include the speed at which policies can be put in place and governance improvements can be implemented, as well as competition with other land uses (food security with a growing global population). In principle, national strategies and action plans should take account of these constraints when determining the scale of ambition for REDD+. The availability of finance to cover the readiness and upfront costs of REDD+, whether domestic or international, will also be a determining factor (Streck, 2012).
Many countries have included forest-related mitigation contributions within their INDCs, which can contribute to setting the stage for large-scale implementation of REDD+ in the coming years. Together with an awareness of the challenges facing implementation and building on the existing momentum in this sector, forest-related mitigation activities represent significant opportunities to narrow the emissions gap and facilitate the transition to a low-emission pathway consistent with limiting global average temperature increase to below 20C in 2100 with >66 per cent chance.

Glossary of Keywords and Phrases

CLIMATE-SMART DEVELOPMENT

Anthropogenic: Human-caused.
Black Carbon (BC): A small, dark particle that warms the earth’s climate. Although black carbon is a particle rather than a greenhouse gas, it is the second-largest climate warmer after carbon dioxide. Unlike carbon dioxide, black carbon is quickly washed out and can be eliminated from the atmosphere if emissions stop. Reductions would also improve human health.
Carbon Dioxide (CO2): The greenhouse gas that contributes the most to global warming. While more than half of the CO2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century, some fraction (about 20 percent) of emitted CO2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.
Global Burdens of Disease: A study to estimate the number of worldwide deaths annually from different diseases or environ- mental causes; can also be divided into different regions and groups. See http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/gbd.
Global Public Goods Benefits: Benefits such as protection of ecosystem services, reduced acid deposition and infrastructure loss, and reduced climate change impacts that are realized beyond the jurisdiction where a policy is implemented or a project carried out.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): Chemical replacements for ozone- depleting substances being phased out by the Montreal Protocol. These substances are used in heating and cooling systems and as aerosols. Although less damaging to the ozone layer than what they replace, they can have very large global warming potentials.
Local Socioeconomic Benefits: Benefits such as GDP growth, employment gains, reduced energy and fuel costs, time savings, improved water and air quality, higher crop yields, improved public health, and reduced mortality that are realized in the jurisdiction that enacts the policy or project.
Methane (CH4): A greenhouse gas that only lasts an average of 12 years in the atmosphere; it is an extremely powerful warmer during that period. One molecule of methane warms about 25 times more than CO2 over 100 years (and 72 times as much over 20 years).
Mitigation: Actions to address climate change by decreasing greenhouse gases and other climate-forcing agents.
Ozone (O3): A harmful pollutant and greenhouse gas that only forms though complex chemical reactions with other substances in the atmosphere (e.g., methane); it can harm human health and crops.
Radiative Forcing: A measure of the net change in the energy balance of the earth with space; that is, the incoming solar radiation minus outgoing terrestrial radiation. At the global scale, the annual average radiative forcing is measured at the top of the atmosphere, or tropopause. Expressed in units of warming rate (watts, W) per unit of area (meters squared, m2).
Short-lived Forcers or Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs):
Substances such as methane, black carbon, tropospheric ozone, and some hydrofluorocarbons that have a significant impact on near-term climate change and a relatively short lifespan in the atmosphere compared to carbon dioxide and other longer-lived gases.
Synergistic Economic Benefits: Macroeconomic benefits from multiplier effects, forward linkage of investment, and potential cross-sector interactions; for example, indirect health and agriculture benefits that would result from the electrification of the transport sector if the power sector simultaneously reduced its carbon intensity and co-pollutant emissions due to a performance standard or a renewable energy mandate.
Systems Approach: An approach capturing the direct and indirect benefits of policies and projects and quantifying their macroeconomic impacts; it is meant to capture the interconnectedness between identified benefits.
Tropospheric Ozone: Sometimes called ground-level ozone, this refers to ozone that is formed or resides in the portion of the atmosphere from the earth’s surface up to the tropopause (the lowest 10–20 km of the atmosphere).


Foreword



The evidence is clear that climate change is already hurting the poor. It is damaging infrastructure, threatening coastal cities, and depressing crop yields, as well as changing our oceans, jeopardizing fish stocks, and endangering sped es.
    The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has shown more clearly than ever before that climate change is real, and that it has impacted every continent and all oceans. Consecutive IPCC reports make dear that we are ill-prepared to manage the risks of climate change and the impact it brings, and that global emissions of greenhouse gases are rising faster than ever before, despite reduction efforts.
    No one will escape the impact. Climate change poses a severe risk to global economic stability. Without urgent mitigation action, ending extreme poverty by 2030 will not be possible
    Al the World Bank Group, we know it doesn’t have to be like this. We believe it is possible to reduce emissions and deliver jobs and economic opportunity, while also cutting health care and energy costs. This report provides powerful evidence in support of that view This publication,  highlights scalable development solutions and builds on research to quantify the social benefits of climate action. The report simulates case studies of policies that could lead to emission reductions in three sectors: transportation, industry, and the energy efficiency of buildings.
    It also describes the national-level impact that scaling-up development solutions could have in five large countries and the European Union. If enacted together, these policies could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the same amount as taking two billion cars off the streets.
    The report also looks at four country-specific projects and the impact they would have if scaled-up nationwide For example, if India built 1,000 kilometers of new bus rapid transit lanes in about twenty large cities, the benefits over 20 years would include more than 27,000 lives saved from reduced accidents and air pollution, and 128,000 long-term jobs created. It would also have large, positive effects on India’s GDP, its agriculture, and the global climate.
   Climate-Smart Development is a collaboration with the Climate- Works Foundation, and provides a framework to better understand the climate risks and benefits in everything we do. The report’s findings show clearly that development done well can deliver significant climate benefits.
    I recommend this publication to policy makers and development practitioners alike

Executive Summary



Officials responsible for a nation’s economy have been primarily concerned with delivering jobs, stimulating growth, and promoting competitiveness. They are also becoming worried about the effects climate change will inflict on their country’s economic future. Increasingly, these officials want to know if there are investments and efforts that can advance urgent development priorities and, at the same time address the challenges of our rapidly warming world.
    Thanks to a growing body of research, it is now clear that climate-smart development can boost employment and can save millions of lives. Smart development policies and projects can also slow the pace of adverse climate changes. Based on this new scientific understanding, and with the development of new economic modeling tools to quantify these benefits, it is clear that the objectives of economic development and climate protection can be complementary.
    This report uses new modeling tools to examine the full range of benefits ambitious climate mitigation policies can produce across the transportation, industry and building sectors in the United States, China, the European Union, India, Mexico and Brazil. This report also describes the multiple benefits of four development project simulations scaled up to the national level.
    The report builds on recent efforts to estimate the development benefits1 that come with a reduction in climate pollutants. These include economic growth, new jobs, improved crop yields, enhanced energy security, healthier people, and millions of lives saved. In many cases these benefits accrue quickly, and they accrue locally, primarily in the nation where action is taken.
Why emissions matter
Climate change impacts impose undeniable burdens on economic development by causing significant damage to agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, infrastructure, and human health. These impacts are proving to be devastating for the world’s most vulnerable populations.
    Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases must be substantially reduced to keep the world from exceeding the 2° Celsius threshold of global warming.2 While efforts to reduce these climate pollutants, despite some progress, have been slow, recent scientific evidence suggests that cutting so-called “short-lived climate pollutants,” which are responsible for up to 40 percent of the current warming, can have immediate climate impacts.3 Complementary actions on greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants can slow the rate of near-term warming, push back dangerous tipping points4 and provide time to allow the world’s poorest people to adapt to the changing climate.
    Among the short-lived climate pollutants, black carbon and methane are climate forcers but they are also air pollutants that injure human health and diminish agriculture production. By reducing them, it is possible to prevent the deaths of 2.4 million people and boost crop production by 32 million tons of crops that would have been lost each year.5 In rural areas, millions of people can be saved from premature death by switching to clean cooking solutions. In cities, commuters can save time, and many thousands of asthma and heart attacks can be alleviated, through improved transit systems. Limiting these pollutants through smart development enhances economies, stimulates production, leaves populations healthier and slows the rate of climate change.
Achieving development and climate goals simultaneously
Policies that reduce GHG emissions and other short-lived climate pollutants can have clear economic, health, and other social benefits. For example, a policy that encourages more efficient transportation—including fuel efficient vehicles, and effective public transit—will save fuel and time which improves energy security and labor productivity. These policies can also reduce smog-related respiratory problems, thus saving lives, and improve visibility, benefiting local investment in sectors such as tourism and recreation. Similarly, a project to improve solid waste management may initially be pursued for its sanitation and health benefits; it can also reduce methane emissions that may boost crop yields and save energy. All these gains directly contribute to economic growth.
    At the project level, these benefits have often been left out of economic analyses because many health and environmental benefits were not easily quantifiable. This has left decision makers with analyses that are incomplete. Recent efforts to better estimate the full impacts of proposed development projects have produced several new analytical tools and models. With these new tools, economists can more fully assess the multiple impacts of pollutants and estimate the value of emission reductions. Today’s tools can also model the synergistic impacts of harms and benefits as they flow through the economy.
A framework to assess benefits
This report attempts to quantify investments that represent a true economic gain in terms of increased economic productivity.6 It does so by applying new modeling tools that give a fuller accounting of the benefits of near-term and long-term climate and development interventions. The report:
• Introduces a holistic, adaptable framework to capture and measure the multiple benefits of reducing emissions of several pollutants
• Demonstrates how local and national policymakers, members of the international development community, and others can use this framework to design and analyze policies and projects
• Contributes a compelling rationale for effectively combining climate action with sustainable development and green growth worldwide
    The report responds to demand from countries that are striving to advance local development priorities and needs for resilient, low carbon growth. By looking at policies and projects more holistically, one can better assess the overall value of actions that reduce emissions of GHGs and short-lived climate pollutants, and provide a more compelling case for coordinated development and climate action.
    The report proposes the following framework to analyze policies and projects:
1. Identify the full range of benefits that result from a project or policy, including improved health, crop yields, energy savings, job growth, labor productivity, and economic growth
2. Select appropriate assessment tools that provide insight on each measurable benefit
3. Choose the appropriate macroeconomic tool to analyze direct and synergistic economic benefits
4. Estimate the full range of benefits and present results using metrics relevant to the audience
    Several simulated case studies are used in this study to demonstrate how to apply this analytical framework. The case studies cover multiple pollutants (particulate matter, primarily black carbon; and GHGs, including methane, a precursor to ozone, and C02) and multiple sectors (transportation, industry, buildings, waste, and agriculture). They demonstrate the frameworks’ benefits from two perspectives: sector policies applied at the national or regional level, and projects implemented at the sub-national level. By applying the framework to analyze both types of interventions, the report demonstrates the value of this approach for national and local policymakers, international finance organizations, and others.
    The report focuses on assessing the multiple benefits of simulated policy and project case studies. These analyses should be viewed as “full implementation simulations”7 relative to a business-as-usual scenario. The benefits quantified have an optimistic bias because they do not necessarily include transaction costs, risks, market distortions, and other factors that would be included in a policy implementation evaluation. Nonetheless, they offer an important building block to refine the approaches, methods, and tools for multiple-benefit analysis. The results also highlight the need to fine-tune the modeling tools to represent real-world conditions more accurately.
Case studies demonstrate sizeable benefits
Three simulated case studies analyzed the effects of key sector policies to determine the benefits realized in six regions® (the United States, China, the European Union, India, Mexico, and Brazil) and the impact on global GDP. The sector policies include regulations, taxes, and incentives to stimulate a shift to clean transport, improved industrial energy efficiency, and more energy efficient buildings and appliances.
    The annual benefits3 of just these policies in 203 0 include an estimated GDP growth of between $1.8 trillion and $2.6 trillion. Approximately 04,000 premature pollution-related deaths could be avoided. Additionally, the policies would avoid production of 8.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CCX.e)10 emissions and almost 16 billion kilowatt-hours of energy saved, a savings roughly equivalent to taking 2 billion cars off the road. These policies alone would account for 30 percent of the total reduction needed in 2030 to limit global warming to 2°C.U Figure E.l illustrates annual benefits for three case studies in 2030 for key sectors.
    This report also presents results of four simulated case studies that analyzed several sub-national development projects, scaled up to the national level, to determine the additional benefits (beyond the economic net present value typically calculated in project financial analysis) over the life of each project, generally 20 years. Four project simulations were studied: expanded bus rapid transit in India, integrated solid waste management in Brazil, cleaner cook stoves in rural China, and táo gas digestion and solar photovoltaics in Mexican agriculture.
    The aggregate benefits over the life of the projects are estimated to include more than 1 million lives saved, about 1 million-1.5 million tons of a op losses avoided, and some 200,000 jobs created. These projects could reduce C02e emissions by 355 million-520 million metric tons, roughly equivalent to shutting down 100-150 coal-fired power plants. This equates to about $100 billion-$134 billion in additional value for just three of these projects in India, Brazil, and Mexico when accounting for health benefits, avoided crop losses, GDP benefits, and the social benefits of carbon mitigation (beyond direct project benefits such as the value of carbon finance assets, reduced operating costs and other project-related economic benefits). In China, the estimated value of avoided premature death alone would come to more than $1 trillion. Figure E.2 illustrates potential benefits for four project simulations scaled to the national level. 8 9 10 11

    Many development efforts—across a range of sectors—hold the promise of economic growth as borne out by economic analysis. Activities that also reduce emissions—across a range of pollutants—deliver health, agriculture and other socioeconomic benefits that are integral to a broader development agenda. Quantifying and including these benefits, where possible, can reveal the broader socioeconomic value of projects while enhancing the case for climate mitigation. Given the rising cost of inaction on climate change, it is imperative that the broad benefits of smart development be included in economic analyses.
    As a result of limitations in the framework and available modeling tools, this report does not provide project-level evaluation for decision making nor does it focus on policy implementation issues or costs, which are required for comprehensive policy evaluation.12 The report does however highlight areas where additional research could improve limitations with the framework. For example, improved tools are needed to account for behavioral changes such as shifting to public transit and advanced cookstoves, and to explicitly account for the full climate change costs of emissions.13 The framework also needs additional work to tailor its application at the individual project level. Areas for research include:
• Further benefits assessments based on more comprehensive emissions data
• Multi-sector macroeconomic analysis that better illustrates the synergistic benefits (for example, using cleaner energy sources to supply the increased power demand for electric cars could yield greater benefits than clean transport or clean power in isolation)
• Additional macroeconomic analysis to reflect the additional benefits of green versus non-green investment options
    As scientists continue to clarify the many ways that local air pollution, short-lived climate pollutants, and greenhouse gases harm health, welfare, and the environment, the framework presented in this report can be honed to better account for these costs by providing more complete economic analyses.
    Ultimately, climate change is an issue for the whole economy and all facets of development. All policy makers, whether in government cabinets or corporate boardrooms, need to understand where they can get development and climate benefits from the decisions they make. Similarly, those charged with informing decisions from a climate perspective need to able to present more complete analysis and evidence of the broad impacts of their projects and policies.

Introduction




Background
Climate change is a fundamental threat to sustainable economic development, with devastating impacts on agriculture, water resources, ecosystems, and human health. Immediate, substantial reductions in C02 and other long-lived GHGs are needed to avoid a 4°C warmer world (UNEP 2011a). While every region will be affected, those least able to adapt—the poor and most vulnerable-will be hit hardest.
    The large and dominant role of C02 emissions in raising global average temperature remains unchanged; understanding of the effects of greenhouse gases and other pollutants on the climate system, however, is improving. Other pollutants—namely methane (CH4), ozone (03), black carbon (BC), and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), collectively referred to as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs)—are now recognized for their potency and as a significant cause of global warming (Methane and HFCs are included in the Kyoto protocol). Although these pollutants have a much shorter lifetime14 in the atmosphere than C02, recent estimates indicate that SLCPs may be responsible for 30-40 percent of overall present-day global warming (Molina et al. 2009; Bond et al. 2013). Reducing emissions of SLCPs now could reduce warming by up to 0.6°C by 2050 (Hu et al. 2013; UNEP 2011a and b; Shindell et al. 2012) and avoid or delay potentially dangerous “tipping points” in important climatic systems (Molina et al. 2009).
    To avoid the long-term threat of climate change, the world must still reduce C02 emissions. But reducing SLCP emissions could slow the rate of warming over the next two to four decades, providing time for the poor and vulnerable to adapt to a changing climate.

SLCPs Damage Health and Crops
The opportunity to mitigate near-term warming is only one reason to reduce SLCP emissions. In addition, air pollution15 imposes an undeniable burden on development and threatens many emerging economies (World Bank 2013d). The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that fast action to reduce emissions of SLCPs could avoid an estimated 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution annually by 2030 and about 32 million tons of crop losses per year.16
    A growing body of scientific literature analyzing the effects of air pollution on health and agricultural activities is rapidly emerging. Observational and modeling studies indicate that outdoor air pollution results in more than 3 million deaths annually, with another 3.5 million or more deaths attributed to household-related air pollution (Lim et al. 2012; Silva et al. 2013; Fang et al. 2013; Avnery et al. 2013). In addition, these and other studies have documented that hundreds of millions of metric tons of crop losses could be avoided each year by reducing emissions. Reducing emissions of BC and methane (which aids in the formation of tropospheric ozone) can provide significant development benefits, including improved health and increased agricultural yields (UNEP/WMO 2011). Annex A explores this literature more fully.

    Crucially, the health benefits of reducing black carbon emissions (especially from biomass cookstoves and transport in Asia and Africa) would be realized immediately and almost entirely in the regions that reduce their emissions. China and India especially will reap the benefits of some reductions, such as reduced background ozone, because of their large populations and agricultural sectors.
Emissions: Sources, Impacts, and Reduction Methods
Emissions are often categorized by how long they persist in the atmosphere.
    Long-lived greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and some HFCs. C02is naturally present in the atmosphere; it is also emitted from burning fossil fuels and biomass, and by certain chemical reactions (e.g., cement manufacturing). Nitrous oxide (N20) is emitted from agricultural, transportation, and industrial sources; its impact on health and agriculture is limited in the examples in this report. Hydrofluorocarbons are used in heating and cooling systems and aerosols; because HFCs do not contribute to health or crop damage, their emissions are not covered in this report.17
    SLCPs include methane, black carbon, and some other HFCs. Methane is released as a fugitive emission from oil and gas production and distribution, agriculture (including livestock and rice farming), decomposition of municipal solid waste, and other sources. In addition to its warming effect, methane leads to the formation of ground-level ozone, a component of smog, which can cause significant crop damage, respiratory illnesses, and other harmful impacts. BC comes from incomplete combustion of carbon-rich fuel; it is a component of particulate matter and is a risk factor for cardiopulmonary disease and can trigger asthma, heart attacks, and strokes.
    Greenhouse gas emissions are usually measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (C02e).
Win-win Opportunities
Many projects and policies offer the opportunity to control C02 and SLCP emissions simultaneously; doing so can deliver both local socioeconomic benefits and global climate benefits, and reduce the net cost of action to mitigate climate change.18
    Several studies indicate the multiple possible synergies that can be achieved by combining measures that address climate change with efforts to improve air quality or energy security (West et al. 2013; Bollen et al. 2009; Shindell et al. 2012). These studies conclude that the multiple benefits of a package of controls are often greater than the individual benefits considered separately; these benefits can reduce the marginal cost when controls are implemented together. They also demonstrate that efforts to reduce SLCP emissions can improve public health, reduce crop losses, and slow the rate of near-term climate change, thereby aiding sustainable development. Recent studies indicate that reducing emissions of BC and methane may also help reduce sea-level rise (Hu et al. 2013).
    Recent work by the World Bank (2013b) in India finds that the combined cost of outdoor and indoor air pollution is more than $40 billion annually, or more than three percent of India’s 2009 GDP. When other environmental degradation is factored in, including crop, water, pasture, and forest damage, the total is closer to 5.7 percent of India’s GDP. This mostly affects the poorest members of society.
    The growing recognition of SLCPs’ deleterious effects on climate, health, agriculture, and the environment suggests that capturing many of these “externalities” can strengthen the economic rationale for projects or policies that reduce SLCPs.
New Modeling Tools Enable More Holistic Planning
New methods and tools for capturing multi-pollutant health, agricultural, and environmental benefits allow for expanded economic analysis that more fully accounts for their monetary value. These tools translate the estimated emissions reductions from interventions in various energy systems (using engineering systems models) into changes in atmospheric concentrations (using chemical transport models) and estimate health and agricultural benefits (via concentration-response models and valuation tools).
    Two innovative programs helped usher in these modern, synergistic, multi-pollutant air quality and energy planning tools: the European Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the U.S. market-based approach to controlling acid rain under the Clean Air Act, where advanced economic efficiency is a major driver of the design of air quality management programs (see Box B-l in Annex B).
    The continued integration of energy, economic, and air quality planning has resulted in a new breed of tools19 that, when linked together, provide comprehensive benefits calculations, often with monetized value as an output. The advent of these tools enables broader economic analysis of émissions-réduction programs, including improved internalization of externalities than was previously feasible. This report explicitly focuses on expanding benefits analysis, as others (for example, Paltsev and Capros 2013) have already explored the subject from the cost perspective.
Objectives of this Report
This report describes efforts by the ClimateWorks Foundation and the World Bank to quantify the multiple economic, social, and environmental benefits associated with policies and projects to reduce emissions in select sectors and regions. The report has three objectives:
• To develop a holistic, adaptable framework to capture and measure the multiple benefits of reducing emissions of several pollutants.
• To demonstrate how local and national policymakers, members of the international development community, and others can use this framework to design and analyze policies and projects.
• To contribute a compelling rationale for effectively combining climate action with sustainable development and green growth worldwide.
    By using a systems approach20 to analyze policies and projects, this work illustrates ways to capitalize on synergies between efforts to reduce emissions and spur development, minimize costs, and maximize societal benefits.
    This report uses several case studies to demonstrate how to apply the analytical framework. The case studies approach this analysis from two perspectives: sector policies applied at the national or regional level and development projects implemented at the sub-national level. The sector policy case studies are based on ClimateWorks’ portfolio analysis. The development project case studies are based on World Bank-financed projects, scaled up to the national level. By applying the framework to analyze both types of interventions, this report demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for national and local policymakers, international finance organizations, and others.
    These case studies show that climate change mitigation and air quality protection can be integral to effective development efforts and can provide a net economic benefit. Quantifying the benefits of climate action can facilitate support from constituencies interested in public health and food and energy security; it can also advance the international discussion of effective ways to address climate change while pursuing green growth.
Report Structure
The current chapter provides background information on the pollutants covered in this report and identifies opportunities to achieve both (local) socioeconomic and (global) climate objectives by reducing emissions. It also introduces new modeling tools that enable broader economic analysis of émissions-réduction programs. Chapter 2 explains how these tools can be combined to develop an effective framework to analyze policies and projects. Chapter 3 demonstrates the framework, using several policy- and project- based case studies to estimate the multiple benefits of emissions reductions from a regional or national level. Finally, Chapter 4 explores the challenges to operationalizing the framework and presents conclusions from the study.


New Framework to Estimate Benefits






The analysis presented in this report uses recently developed emissions modeling and assessment tools and an integrated macroeconomic model. Prior analyses added some environmental externalities into cost-benefit analyses by quantifying and monetizing specific benefits and adding them individually to the benefits side of the ledger. The framework proposed here advances this work by taking a systems approach, integrating multiple benefits into a macroeconomic model to demonstrate the additional benefits that can accrue—in terms of GDP and employment—as the benefits flow through the economy. All of these benefits are not routinely captured in cost-benefit approaches; new tools make it possible, however, to include many of them in project and policy analyses where emissions can be quantified.
Benefits Framework
The framework to assess the multiple benefits of projects and policies to reduce emissions of GHGs and SLCPs follows these steps:
1. Identify the full range of benefits: These should include all potential benefits that result from a project or policy, including:
a. Local socioeconomic benefits—such as GDP growth, employment gains, reduced energy and fuel costs, time savings, improved water and air quality, higher crop yields, improved public health, and reduced mortality—that are realized in the jurisdiction that enacts the policy or undertakes the project.
b. 
Global public goods benefits—such as protection of ecosystem services, reduced acid deposition and infrastructure loss, and reduced climate change impacts—that are realized beyond the jurisdiction that carries out the policy or project. For example, reduced sulfate and methane emissions can have large downwind benefits (i.e., beyond the locality that reduced the emissions).
c. Combined benefits that can be realized both locally and globally. While it is important for nations to realize the local benefits of emissions control, it is equally important for them to recognize the shared benefits that accrue to them when their neighbors and other global actors reduce their emissions.
2. Identify appropriate benefits assessment tools: These should include available tools that provide insight on each measurable benefit at the scale or resolution appropriate to the analysis. Selection (or development) of suitable analytical tools is critical. For example, several slightly different tools are used in this report for individual case studies, but entirely different tools may be used as long as they adequately assess the relevant benefits. Those benefits that cannot be quantitatively assessed should be qualitatively described and included in economic analysis.
3. Identify an appropriate macroeconomic tool: This model should enable analysis of economic benefits across sectors and types of benefits. For example, health or agricultural benefits may have a positive effect on other areas of the economy (e.g. labor productivity, household disposable income); energy savings in one sector might benefit another sector (e.g. by reducing energy costs and the investment needed to supply energy).

4. Estimate significant benefits: Appropriate metrics should be used to measure significant benefits, and the results should be presented so that they are meaningful to the audience they affect. For example, while economic effects might best be presented in monetary terms for policymakers, talking about the impact on cardiovascular health might be more relevant to health officials. Similarly, presenting benefits in terms of crop yields is likely to resonate more with farmers.
    This framework is consistent with the World Bank’s paradigm of “inclusive green growth” (World Bank 2012b) in that it recognizes the limitations of traditional cost-benefit analysis and attempts to supplement it by quantifying additional benefits to more completely demonstrate the value of green growth strategies. Because different benefits resonate with different audiences at the regional, national, and sub-national levels, it is worthwhile to acknowledge all the benefits in economic analysis, even if not all can be monetized.
Step 1: Identify the Full Range of Benefits
The first step in applying the framework requires consideration of all potential economic, social, and environmental benefits that a project or policy may yield at the local and global levels. Many common interventions in the energy, transportation, and building sectors are likely to have similar benefits.
    For World Bank-financed development projects, socioeconomic benefits are likely to be among the primary motivations, and they should be assessed as part of routine project appraisal. All indirect economic impacts should be considered, such as multiplier and flow-through effects that result from linkages in the economy (for example, whether project investment results in greater manufacturing or construction services) or the effects of complementary economic policies (such as changes in structural relationships due to incentives for local purchases). Studies have shown that reduced traffic congestion enhances economic development (UNEP 2011c; ESCAP 2007) and improved health leads to greater labor force productivity (Sanderson et al. 2013). These economic benefits should be included in analyses; this involves reviewing potentially significant effects and ensuring they are represented appropriately in available modeling tools.
    Some socioeconomic benefits are difficult to include in an economic analysis because they are not easily quantified or their assessment relies on contingent valuation methodologies (such as willingness to pay for various benefits). For emissions reduction activities, these benefits can include improved public health and higher crop yields; reduced infrastructure losses from acid rain; improved visibility (which has its own intrinsic value and reduces economic losses in the tourism, aviation. and recreation industries) ; and time savings due to new public transit. These less tangible benefits can have spillover effects on the macro-economy; for example, good urban environmental quality is important to attract and retain the talented professionals who drive wealth creation in knowledge-based economies (Florida 2000).
    Environmental benefits are similarly treated as an externality in most economic analyses. As the WAVES partnership21 for Natural Capital Accounting demonstrates, however, many countries are beginning to reflect the costs of reduced ecosystems services on their national ledgers. Environmental benefits include biodiversity, ecosystem services, and reduced climate change impacts.
Step 2: Identify Appropriate Benefits Assessment Tools
Many types of integrated assessment models are widely used to estimate the benefits or impacts associated with emissions reductions. For example, the partial-equilibrium Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) models the impacts of climate change policies and technologies on GHG emissions, energy consumption, production, and the economy linked to the energy sector (Clarke et al. 2008). The Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model is used in co-benefits studies to assess the health and ecosystem impacts of particulate pollution, acidification, eutrophication, and tropospheric ozone (Amman et al. 2008). Several other technology models also simulate anthropogenic systems and their linkage to the atmosphere, quantifying several benefits. These include top-down and bottom-up approaches, and they have evolved significantly as a result of regulatory programs that have emphasized economic efficiency (See Box B-l in Annex B).
    Key features of these models include their ability to estimate the regional costs and a range of benefits of alternative emissions control strategies, and to identify cost-effective measures to achieve specified emissions reduction targets. This study used a variety of models to determine changes in emissions, in costs, and in health, agricultural, and other economic benefits.
    The particular tools chosen for this study should be viewed as examples only. The World Bank’s low-carbon growth studies (ESMAP 2012) provide many other examples of methods to assess long-term mitigation potential and benefits even though the overarching goal of those studies was to reduce the emissions trajectory of growth at the country level.






Tools Used for Sector Policy Benefits Assessment
This report relied on two models to analyze the benefits of the policy-based case studies (See Figure 2.1 and Annex B):
    
Two development project case studies, on biogas digesters and improved cookstoves, relied on project experience and expert judgment to estimate emissions reductions and benefits. The focus of the analysis in all cases is to demonstrate an adaptable framework to assess benefits.



♦ Marginal abatement cost curve model (MACC). Developed by McKinsey <& Co. (Enkvist et al. 2009) with ClimateWorks support, this model estimates potential emissions reductions and associated costs. Although not as detailed as sector-specific models, it represents a unified view of the available technical measures to reduce GHG emissions or SLCPs, their emissions reduction potential (MtC02e), and the associated cost($/tCO;.e) in a specific year for different regions and countries. The abatement potential and corresponding costs are calculated relative to a business-as-usual scenario (BAU) in a given year.22 23 24 In this study, impacts in 2C80 are considered.
* Fast Scenario Screening Tool (TM5-EASST). Developed by the European Commission Joint Research Centre (VanDingenen et al. 2009), this model estimates health and agricultural impacts. This model links emissions of pollutants in a given source region to downwind pollutant levels (at the national level and globally) using meteorology and atmospheric chemistry. Pollutant levels are then used to calculate impacts by applying specific dose-response functions from scientific literature. The outputs include lives saved per year from avoided cardiopulmonary, respiratory, and lung-cancer-related causes, as well as changes in agricultural yields for maize, rice, wheat, and soybean.
Tools Used for Development Project Benefits Assessment
The four development project case studies used several sector-specific tools and bottom-up analyses to estimate the benefits of the interventions, including TM5-FASST and:
• Transportation Emissions Evaluation Models for Projects (TEEMP) (GEF 2010). Developed by Clean Air Asia (ADB 2013), this model quantifies emissions and multiple benefits (such as reduced accidents and travel time), and uses simplified analysis to determine the economic feasibility of a project. As a technology-oriented model, it relies on projected demand as an input rather than independently assessing the future demand for new technologies.25
• Environmental .Assessment of Solid Waste Systems and Technologies (EASEWASTE). Developed by the Technical University of Denmark (Kirkeby et al. 2008), this life-cycle assessment model follows waste management from generation through collection, transportation, and treatment, and calculates the environmental emissions and impacts of alternative treatment scenarios.

Step 3: Identify an Appropriate Macroeconomic Tool
 For all of the case studies in this report, the outputs from the MACC, FAS ST, and other tools are fed into the Global Energy Industry Model (GEIM) from Oxford Economics, which calculates the macroeconomic implications of climate and air quality interventions. Macroeconomic models are quantitative tools routinely used to evaluate the impact of economic and policy shocks—particularly policy reforms—on the economy as a whole. These models reproduce (in a stylized manner) the structure of the whole economy, including the economic transactions among diverse agents (productive sectors, households, the government, and others). This approach is especially useful when the expected effects of policy implementation are complex and materialize through different transmission channels, as is the case with climate and energy policies. Details about the GEIM can be found in Annex B.
Limitations of Bottom-up and Macroeconomic Modeling
Combining bottom-up (MACC) and top-down (macroeconomic modeling) approaches has advantages and disadvantages. Bottom- up models disaggregate energy consumption across sectors and consider specific energy technologies with technical and economic parameters, but they often neglect to account for feedbacks in the economy and the effects of international energy markets. Top-down models are good at identifying complex and dynamic interactions among macroeconomic variables, but they are very aggregated and lack the level of resolution necessary to inform policymaking. Additionally, top-down macroeconomic models show only how real resources are reallocated among economic activities after the economy has “equilibrated” following a shock to the system (e.g., an oil price change) ; they generally cannot easily model the gradual uptake of new technologies. Both kinds of models depend crucially on some simplifying assumptions that do not reflect real-world conditions. This can be remedied to a certain extent by tailoring the scenarios to specific needs, but uncertainties remain that must be recognized and highlighted when presenting the results.26
    Another concern with respect to economic analysis of capital investment relates to the Keynesian effects of some projects. For example, disaster reconstruction aid might generate significant economic activity with GDP benefits, but it does not improve productivity; rather it simply replaces productive capacity that was lost in a disaster. Assuming some slack in the economy, all spending will produce multiplier effects on GDP, or “Keynesian benefits.” Thus analysis must carefully distinguish any productivity benefits that result from green investment.
    In this analysis, the GEIM model deals with Keynesian effects to some extent by recognizing the long-term drag on the economy caused by capital investment. Any additional investment that does not improve efficiency or expand productive capacity puts a drag on the economy in the long term. The transmission channel for this is essentially crowding out: the additional investment increases demand and, as a result, GDP and the rate of inflation; in response, the central bank raises interest rates, which causes demand (in particular investment) to fall and GDP to move back toward baseline levels. If the additional investment is large enough, it will crowd out a significant portion of capacity-expanding investment, which will in turn result in lower potential and actual output in the long run.27
    To the extent that GDP rises above baseline levels in the case studies in this report, it reflects an increase in productivity or energy efficiency that results in sustainable economic development. In future analyses, it may be appropriate to compare GDP growth for a proposed intervention with the Keynesian effects associated with a default alternative project, such as the average distribution of historic public investment. The net effect would represent the benefit or cost of the proposed intervention.
Step 4: Estimate and Present Significant Benefits
The fourth step in the framework requires that the benefits are measured and presented appropriately for various audiences. This involves selecting metrics that are meaningful to the audience, and not all benefits can or should be monetized and aggregated. Economic effects should be presented in monetary terms, such as net present value or change in GDP. Specific health benefits may be more relevant to public health officials than the statistical monetized value of avoided mortalities. Tons of avoided crop losses will likely resonate most with farmers and agricultural policymakers.
    The next chapter shows how this framework can be applied, and the benefits of a variety of case studies are estimated using a range of metrics. For policymakers, information on mitigation costs and benefits help identify policies that can optimize development or welfare benefits while also attaining environmental goals. For international finance and development organizations, the results of different scenarios indicate which sectors and regions stand to benefit most from financial interventions. For non-climate philanthropists and analysts, the economic, social, and environmental benefits provide insights on how emissions mitigation measures can also improve public health and food and energy security.


Multiple Benefits Assessment—Case Studies


The framework described in the preceding chapter was applied to two types of case studies to demonstrate the estimation of benefits from two perspectives: (1) sector policies applied at the national or regional level, and (2) development projects implemented at the sub-national level. By applying the framework to analyze both types of interventions, this report demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for national and local policymakers, international finance organizations, and others. A summary of the case studies is presented in this chapter, and more detailed descriptions are contained in Annex C (for sector policies) and Annex D (for development projects).
Valuation Methods Used in this Report
This report uses the following methods to monetize the benefits of climate and development action:
• Value of statistical life (VSL): Adjusting for differences in income and purchasing power, the following values of statistical lives saved were established (all reported in 2010 purchasing power parity in U.S. dollars).Using methods recommended by the OECD (2011), values for OECD member countries were based on a U.S. value of $7,887,511 (U.S. EPA Guidance 2000) ;28 EU, $5,713,388 and Mexico, $3,055,289. Values for non-OECD countries were derived by averaging available estimates of locally determined VSLs:29 Brazil, $1,555,802; China, $700,635; and India, $967,998.
• Crop values: For agricultural sectors, this report uses the 2010 World Bank average grain crop price of $171.8030 per ton for the crops considered (maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans) and further estimates that each metric ton of cereal contains three million kilocalories (kcal) of energy. Assuming a daily calorie need of 3,000 kilocalories of energy (kcal), this translates into about one million kcal per person per year. Hence one metric ton of cereal can feed three people for one year (Cassidy et al. 2013; Nellemann et al. 2009).
• Social cost of carbon: C02 emissions reductions are valued in this report based on U.S. government estimates of the social cost of carbon, which project changes in agricultural productivity, human health, and property damage from increased flood risks.31 Due to limited data availability and uncertainty, however, this social cost of carbon does not account for all the damage caused by increased C02, and it does not explicitly account for the health and agriculture benefits of reduced SLCP emissions. This report uses the average values ($34 per ton in 2010, rising due to increased damages over time to approximately $55 per ton in 2030) obtained using discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent in 2010 dollars (U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon 2013). Benefits derived using the 3 percent discount rate are presented in the main text for illustration, but sensitivity to other social discount rates is presented in the annexes.

• Carbon finance value: GHG reductions can help finance certain projects through the sale of certified emissions reductions in various carbon markets, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and the EU Emissions Trading System. The value of the emissions reduction is determined by individual market conditions and does not reflect the full value to society.
• C02 mitigation cost: The cost per ton of avoided C02 emissions is determined by the MACC model.
• Effect on GDP: The macroeconomic impacts of the multiple benefits as they flow through the economy are calculated using the GEIM model. A discount rate of 10 percent is used (consistent with Belli et al. 1998) within the GEIM macroeconomic calculations. However, social discount rates of 2.5, 3, and 5 percent were used to calculate the net present value of GDP and other socioeconomic benefits. Again, the central value of 3 percent was used for illustrative purposes in the main text, but sensitivity to the other social discount rates is presented in the annexes.
• Project benefits: The stated benefits of World Bank-financed development projects are calculated as the net present value of the stream of annual benefits less costs over the life of a project (scaled to the national level for the case studies presented). These stated benefits might include new revenue streams (such as fees collected) and cost savings (such as reduced energy or transit costs).
• Energy savings: The monetized values for energy savings are obtained by assuming a price of oil of $80/barrel in 2010 dollars, in accordance with the scenario assumptions of MACC 3.0 (see Annex C) and applying the following equivalences: 1 GWh = 8.6e~5 Mtoe and 1 Mtoe = 7.33 Mboe (IEA, BP). This is a rather crude, imprecise estimate, but it is nonetheless useful in providing an order of magnitude of the monetary savings associated with the emission reductions in each case study.
Sector Policy Case Studies
The case studies presented below analyze three key sector policy interventions needed to address the mitigation gap identified by UNEP (2013). They describe policy changes, including regulations, incentives, and taxes, to stimulate specific measures30 to cut emissions from three sectors: transportation, industry, and buildings relative to a “no new policy” baseline scenario.31 The analysis includes impacts in five countries and one region—China, India, the EU, the U.S., Mexico, and Brazil (subsequently, for simplicity, referred to in this report as “six regions”)—plus the impact on global GDP. This analysis refers to the U.S. and the E.U. as developed countries and to China, India, Mexico, and Brazil as emerging economies. The case studies use the MACC model to identify all quantified opportunities to reduce emissions of C02 with a mitigation cost below $80/tCO2e32 33 34 35 (Spiegel and Bresch 2013; Dinkel et al. 2011).
    These mitigation costs are defined as the incremental cost of a low-emission technology compared with the reference case, measured in $/tC02e. These costs include two key components: (1) the annualized repayments for capital expenditure (CapEx), or the additional investments in new technology or replacement infrastructure necessary to achieve the GHG emission reductions, and (2) the operational costs or savings (OpEx), fuel- and nonfuel-related, associated with each abatement opportunity. The abatement costs can therefore be interpreted as pure project costs incurred to install and operate each low-emitting technology. Other key elements—transaction costs, communication/information costs, subsidies or explicit C02 costs, taxes, and the economic impacts of investing significantly in low-emitting technology (such as advantages from technology leadership)—are deliberately excluded from the cost calculations.
    Since data is only available for black carbon and methane, the health and agricultural benefits estimated here are conservative.36 They therefore have a negligible impact on the economy relative to the size of the economy and the labor force. A future study (see footnote 52 in Annex C) will examine similar benefits for mitigating a larger suite of pollutants.
    As described in the prior chapter, the quantified SLCP emission reductions from the MACC model are fed into the TM5-FASST tool to model the resulting health and agricultural impacts in 2030 (see Annex C for the 2020 values). Although the impacts are mostly seen in the regions where emissions are reduced, downwind impacts in other regions are also observed. These emissions reductions and impacts, including reduced mortality and decreased crop damage, are fed into the GEIM. The resulting outputs include changes in GDP and employment. The “transmission channels”37 and results are summarized below.
    Each sector policy case study analyzes the macroeconomic results of two scenarios in order to estimate the lower and upper bounds of possible effects of the policy interventions.
Scenario 1 makes two key assumptions:
a. Self-financed transition: Each country pays for the full costs of the transformations required to reduce GHG emissions.
b. No technology transfer: Developed countries produce all the new (cleaner, more efficient) technology needed to transform each sector, which boosts their exports and emerging markets import the necessary technology.
Scenario 2 is similar to Scenario 1 but makes different assumptions:
a. International climate finance: Developed countries pay for 60 percent of the capital expenditures incurred by emerging economies to reduce GHG emissions on a prorata basis depending on their GDP.
b. Accelerated technology transfer: Emerging economies produce 80-100 percent of the new (cleaner, more efficient) technology needed to transform each sector, while developed countries produce 100 percent of their own technology.
    Results are categorized as global or local benefits. As explained in Chapter 2, global public goods benefits include reduced climate change impacts and the transboundary benefits of reduced emissions; local socioeconomic benefits include health and other benefits realized within the five focus countries and one region that reduce emissions. Changes to GDP are presented on a global basis. The social value of carbon is based on the social cost of carbon explained above, using a 3 percent discount rate. Values for different discount rates are shown in Annex C. For monetizing global value of lives saved, the VSL for India is used as most of the global total is found in the South Asian region.
Sector Policy Case Study 1 : Shift to Clean Transport
GHG emissions from the transportation sector account for about 13 percent of global total; of that, emissions from road transport account for about 80 percent of total transport emissions. These numbers highlight the opportunity for governments and the private sector to work together to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation.

Case Study Interventions
This case study includes the following changes:
• Improving the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles.
  • Shifting to hybrid and electric vehicles.
• Transitioning to low-carbon fuels such as bio-ethanol for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
• Increasing government investment in transport infrastructure to support the new vehicle types.
  • Shifting from cars to public transit (rail, bus, and BRT).
• Shifting freight from trucks to trains (rubber to rail) and ships (rubber to sea).
    This case study places greater emphasis on technology change and less on mode shift, in part because it is based on a MACC model that does not fully account for behavior changes such as a shift to mass transit. Thus this model may unfairly compare marginal changes to a carbon-intensive transport mode with the major infrastructure changes needed for an innovative, low-emissions mode. For instance, because recharging networks for electric cars require high fixed investment, the cheapest option would appear to be smaller changes to conventional vehicles. However, climate change uncertainty and inertia argue for early mitigation that requires system-level changes. Despite this drawback of the MACC model, this case study illustrates the economic benefits of such a transition.
Case Study Benefits
The benefits of a shift to cleaner transportation include substantial fuel savings and reduced air-quality-related complications and deaths resulting from respiratory illnesses. Since households and firms would have to buy less fuel, they would have more money to spend on other goods and services; in addition, the reduced demand for oil would lower oil prices, providing a boost to the economy.38 The power sector would, however, need to make investments to meet the increased electricity demand from electric vehicles; the costs of this investment would ultimately be paid by consumers. Other benefits, such as time savings and reduced fatalities from improved public transportation systems, are not quantified here.
    Global GDP would be about 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent higher than baseline levels in 2030 for Scenarios 1 and 2 (equivalent to $600 billion and $1 trillion in 2010 dollars, respectively). The impact across countries is, however, heterogeneous. Developed economies would perform best, even in the scenario least favorable to them. For emerging markets, the combination of higher electricity prices and the long-run drag from paying for capital investments (See description of Keynesian effects on Pg. 8), even in the scenario that assumes a significant role for international climate finance, would result in GDP growth being dampened relative to baseline levels in 2030.
    By 2030, the mitigation measures undertaken in the five countries and one region are estimated to save more than 21,000 lives globally each year from avoided premature deaths. Within the focus countries and region, the emissions reductions would reduce air-quality-related mortality by about 20,000 lives per year; in monetary terms, the reduced deaths would be equivalent to $87 billion (2010 dollars). India and China account for over 90 percent of the total (see Figure 3.1).
    Results of the case study are summarized in Box 3.1.

Summary and Conclusions
As shown in Figure 3.2, a transformation of the transport sector toward more-efficient vehicles and freight and greater use of advanced biofuels and public transit, would have significant economic and health benefits in the six focus regions. These changes would save about $170 per ton of avoided C02 emissions. At the global level, GDP would be about 0.5-0.8 percent higher than baseline levels in 2030, but the impact across countries would be mixed. Developed economies would perform best, even in the scenario least favorable to them. However, emerging economies, particularly India and China, would reap the greatest benefits in lives saved from reduced air pollution. As noted above, because of limited emissions data, the mortality savings and resulting economic impacts are conservative.
Sector Policy Case Study 2: Energy-efficient Industry
Direct and indirect39 C02e emissions from the industrial sector are the single biggest contributor to global emissions. Direct emissions alone account for about 20 percent of global emissions. The cement, chemicals, and iron and steel sectors are the three largest emitters; government policies to reduce their emissions would have a significant impact on the global fight to contain climate change.
Case Study Interventions
This case study considers the impact of a government-led transformation of industry, including a shift to clean fuels and reduced energy consumption. Specific changes include a switch from coal to natural gas, biomass, and electricity; more-efficient motors, kilns, and coke ovens; and carbon capture and storage.
Case Study Benefits
The shift to a more energy-efficient industrial sector would have significant impacts on the economy, health, and agricultural productivity. The TM5-FASST model shows that the fuel switch would reduce emissions-related mortalities by about 52,000 lives per year for the six focus regions; the majority of these are in India (see Figure 3.2). In monetary terms, the mortality savings are equivalent to about $240 billion (2010 dollars). In addition, because of reduced crop damage from ozone emissions, yields for four crops (maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans) would increase by about 1.3 million metric tons in the six regions. The EU and China would reap the most agricultural benefits. The global impact of these mitigation measures (including benefits that accrue outside the six focus regions) would result in a total of about 58,000 lives saved per year in 2030, and in an increase in crop yields of 1.72 million tons per year in 2030.
    Based on the GEIM model, global GDP would be about 1-1.2 percent above baseline levels in 2030 in Scenarios 1 and 2 (equivalent to $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion respectively), with heterogeneous impacts across countries. Because developed countries have already made substantial improvements to their industrial energy efficiency, the average gains available from lower energy consumption are limited. In Scenario 1 (which assumes that developed countries produce most of the high-tech infrastructure needed to transform the sector), however, developed countries do gain from an increase in exports of capital goods to emerging economies. For the emerging economies, the potential gains from lower energy use are more significant and, as a result, these countries improve their global competitiveness in both scenarios. While the impact on GDP and jobs is positive everywhere, in Scenario 1 developed countries experience slower growth in GDP and employment than in Scenario 2. In both scenarios, emerging economies see significant employment gains. The results of the case study are summarized in Box 3.2.

Summary and Conclusions
A more energy-efficient industrial sector would be a key step in the global effort to contain climate change. As shown in Figure 3.4, such a transition would also have significant global economic, health, and agricultural benefits. Global GDP would be about 1–1.2% above baseline levels in 2030, with uneven impacts across countries. Potential gains from lower energy use are limited for developed countries, because they have already greatly improved their industrial energy efficiency. They could benefit, however, by increasing their exports of high-tech, low-emission capital goods.
Emerging economies could reap significant gains from lower energy consumption. These countries have the most to gain from new capital investments; by reducing their production costs more on average than developed countries, they improve their competitive- ness and gain market share and jobs in both scenarios.
The vast majority of health benefits from reduced air pollution are estimated to occur in emerging economies, particularly in India, Brazil, and China. Crop yields would also rise significantly, especially in the EU, China, and the U.S. As noted above, the health and agriculture benefits are likely understated because of limited emissions data (see Annex C).
Sector Policy Case Study 3: Energy-efficient Buildings
Although residential and commercial buildings account for a relatively small proportion of global emissions (just under 10 percent), relatively simple and cost-effective improvements in energy efficiency could significantly reduce energy consumption—and therefore energy-related emissions—worldwide.
Case Study Interventions
This case study presents the impacts of government policies to reduce energy use in residential and commercial buildings through more efficient appliances, electronics, and equipment; better insulation, including retrofits and new construction; and improved heating, cooling, and refrigeration systems.
Case Study Benefits
Reducing the energy used by buildings would have significant impacts on the economy and human health. The TM5-FASST model estimates that the accompanying reductions in emissions of air pollutants would reduce mortality by about 22,000 lives per year in the focus regions. The vast majority of the avoided deaths are in India (as shown in Figure 3.6), primarily due to the large reduction in black carbon emissions when traditional residential cookstoves are replaced with more fuel-efficient ones (see Table C.l in Annex C) and dirty fuels are replaced with liquid petroleum gas and other cleaner fuels (Dinkel et al. 2011). In monetary terms, the lives saved would be equivalent to $102 billion (2010 dollars) for the six regions considered. The global impact of mitigation measures undertaken in the six focus regions is estimated to result in a total of about 24,000 lives saved per year in 2030 from avoided premature mortality. Because of limited data availability, however, this analysis includes only a small subset of pollutants (primarily BC) and an underestimate of emissions mitigated in the buildings sector (Wagner et al. 2013); the estimated health benefits, therefore, are conservative.
    From a macroeconomic perspective, the efficiency improvements raise global GDP by 0-0.2 percent in Scenario 1 and 2, respectively (up to $240 billion, in 2010 dollars) from the baseline scenario in 2030. As in other sectors, the key transmission channels are the effects of the changes in capital investment and energy consumption; the impacts are heterogeneous across countries. In Mexico, for example, households can achieve greater energy savings, at lower cost, than households in the other countries.40 Because the cost of household efficiency improvements is more than recouped through lower energy bills, household incomes in Mexico would rise, boosting consumption and GDP. (In contrast, households in Brazil would make the smallest gains in Scenario 1, where efficiency improvements are relatively limited but carry a significant investment cost.)
    The heterogeneous impact on GDP is also reflected in employment. Most countries see some growth in jobs; China and India gain the most in absolute numbers, but the increase in Mexico’s GDP means it gains the most jobs relative to its labor force (a
1.3 percent rise in employment above the 2030 baseline). The results of the case study are summarized in Box 3.3 below.
Summary and Conclusions
Improving the energy efficiency of commercial and residential buildings—including appliances, small equipment, and heating and cooling systems—would support climate change mitigation efforts and benefit human health and the global economy. Global GDP would be about 0-0.2 percent above baseline levels in 2030, but the impact across countries is uneven and largely independent of their income levels. Mexico performs relatively strongly, as its households are able to save significant energy at relatively little cost, which in turn boosts real incomes, consumption, and GDP.
    As in other sectors, the vast majority of health benefits from reduced air pollution would occur in emerging economies, particularly India and China. Although not quantified here, impacts on agricultural productivity would also be significant if data were available for a fuller set of emissions (see Annex C).
Development Project Case Studies
The case studies below are based on World Bank-financed, subnational development projects, scaled up to estimate their impacts at the national level. Using the analytical framework described above, these projects are analyzed relative to a “no project” baseline to determine the additional benefits (beyond the net present economic value typically calculated in project financial analysis) that would accrue over the life of each project (generally 20 years).
    This presentation differs from the results shown in the sector policy case studies. It is intended to present an aggregated view of each project’s value over the planning horizon in deciding whether to proceed with a project. While these case studies focus on demonstrating a broader range of benefits during the implementation and analysis phases of development initiatives, it is important to consider these issues during the planning stages so that project designers can adjust plans to optimize a comprehensive range of benefits.
    All these case studies should be viewed as simulations that, while based on realistic projects and data, require assumptions for scaling that may or may not be feasible to implement. These simulations are meant to demonstrate the potential for additional benefits beyond what is derived from current project-level economic

analysis.41 (The analytical tools used for these simulations are described in Steps 2 and 3 of the framework (see Chapter 2); the valuation methods are explained at the beginning of this chapter. Finally, see Annex D for more details on these case studies.)
Development Project Case Study 1 : Sustainable Transportation in India
Affordable, low-emissions transport is crucial for development. People need effective transit options for access to jobs, education, and health services; economic activity requires the transport of goods. Well-designed and -enforced bus rapid transit (BRT) is a relatively inexpensive way to get people out of high-emitting vehicles and to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. In 2009, the World Bank approved a sustainable urban transport project for India that included BRT in three pilot cities. The Pimpri-Chinchwad BRT may serve as a model for replication across India; it was analyzed in depth in this case study to establish realistic benefits that can be expected under real-world conditions.
Case Study Interventions
The results of the Pimpri-Chinchwad BRT analysis and a Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) study of more than 87 cities across India were used to estimate the length of viable BRT routes that could realistically be developed across India, as well as the per-kilometer costs and benefits of such development. For this case study, the length was estimated at approximately 1,000 km, including more than 422 km that is already included in government plans. This was contrasted against a “no BRT” scenario. The analysis estimates that investment of $3-4 billion would be needed to develop 1,000 km of BRT corridors in about 20 cities across India within 6-12 years.
Case Study Benefits
Analysis using the TEEMP model shows that large reductions in time, emissions, fuel use, and traffic fatalities can be achieved by shifting passenger traffic away from current transportation patterns to a modern BRT system. The emissions reduction benefits were further analyzed using the TM5-FASST tool, which shows that reductions in black carbon and co-pollutant emissions from the expanded BRT would reduce crop losses and deaths from respiratory illnesses. Capital investments, operation and maintenance costs, fuel savings, and productivity benefits were fed into the Oxford Economics GEIM, which shows further benefits: Investment in India’s infrastructure will boost its economy and create jobs, and the switch to mass transit will reduce the overall cost of transport, raising firms’ profit margins and households’ real incomes.
    Results are summarized in Figure 3.7; in Box 3.4 they are compared with the net present value of the project as estimated by current project analysis methods. Here the reduced cost of transport per passenger kilometer was scaled up (less project costs). Annual financial flows of all benefits are aggregated through 2033 and discounted at three percent. (See Annex D for a sensitivity analysis to alternative values of the social discount rate.

Summary and Conclusions
A comprehensive value of the project was established by exploring the multiple benefits of expanded BRT systems. As shown above, the benefits include time and fuel savings, reduced environmental impact, and fewer deaths from traffic accidents and air-quality-related respiratory illnesses. There would also be significant macroeconomic benefits. In addition to the $9.7 billion in NPV that might typically be used to justify such a project, this study has identified more than $62 billion in added value, including the social cost of carbon and the welfare benefits of lives saved, crops protected, and GDP growth. In addition, more than 5,000 tons of black carbon emissions would be eliminated, with potentially strong climate benefits. While not all of these benefits can be directly included in the project’s financial analysis, they could be part of the discussion of broader economic benefits that accrue to a country as a result of such a transportation program.
Development Project Case Study 2: Integrated Solid Waste Management in Brazil
Effective management of municipal solid waste poses “one of the biggest challenges [to] the urban world” (UN-Habitat 2010). In lo win come countries, most cities collect less than half of the waste generated, and only half of the collected waste is processed to minimum acceptable environmental and health standards. Properly managing waste to minimize methane emissions offers a variety of local and global benefits. Locally, improper waste management, especially open dumping and open burning, contaminates water, air, and land; attracts disease vectors; and dogs drains, contributing to flooding. At the global scale, burning waste without proper air pollution controls creates toxic pollutants; improper disposal also pollutes the oceans, threatening ecosystems, fisheries, and tourism. Waste is an emerging contributor to climate change, emitting 5 percent of global GHGs and 12 percent of methane (Bogner et al. 2007). Waste has the potential, however, to be a net sink of GHGs when used as a resource, through recycling and reuse (Bogner etal. 2007).

Case Study Interventions

This case study estimates the emissions reductions from integrated solid waste management in Brazil by a simulated scale-up of one project to the national level. The model project selected is an inte- grated solid waste management project with an innovative carbon finance platform. The registered carbon finance methodology inte- grates a seamless payment structure within solid waste management investments, greatly facilitating the sale of credits and the additional benefits that can be captured from those resources. It is a $50 million financial intermediary loan for on-lending to borrowers with solid waste subprojects. The project aims to improve the treatment and disposal of municipal solid waste; its success is measured by the number of open dumps closed and the increased volume of waste disposed in sanitary landfills, composted, or recycled. Brazil was selected for scale-up due to the existing strong regulatory structure and finance instruments available in this sector.
Four different policy scenarios for managing Brazil’s waste were compared with a reference baseline:
• Baseline: The current state of solid waste management in Brazil, with 58 percent of waste going to sanitary landfills, most of which flare the methane produced; the remainder of the waste is going to open dumps, which simply vent the methane produced.






• All landfill scale-up: All generated waste ends up in a sanitary landfill (no more open dumping), and 50 percent of landfill gas is collected and flared.
• All landfill with electricity generation: Similar to the previous scenario, but 50 percent of landfill gas is flared and 50 percent is used to generate electricity, displacing natural gas on the electricity grid.
• Anaerobic digestion of organic waste with electricity generation: Seventy-five percent of organic waste is sorted and routed to anaerobic digesters to produce electricity, displacing natural gas on the grid; the resulting compost is used as fertilizer (but no market value is assessed for fertilizer substitutions).
• Composting for organic waste: Seventy-five percent of organic waste is sorted and composted. Again, this compost is not assumed to displace any fertilizer; this underestimates the environmental benefits.
    For all of the Brazilian waste scenarios explored, the most relevant result is the difference between the policy scenario at the baseline and at “full implementation.” The required investment is estimated at $1-2 billion per year through 2030.
Case Study Benefits
The project will result in reduced methane emissions as well as a variety of other benefits, including improved water quality, improved soil quality, improved public health, and decreased mining of natural resources. The methane reductions were estimated using the EASEWASTE solid waste lifecycle assessment model, using data specific to Brazil for generation rates, composition, electricity grid, and landfill behavior. Generic data was used to model the composting facilities and the anaerobic digesters.
    Improved organic waste treatment, through anaerobic digestion and composting, with electricity production offers the greatest potential for methane reduction from solid waste for Brazil (on the order of 15-30 million metric tons of C02e per year). These emissions reductions were input into the FASST tool to estimate additional health and crop benefits from reduced ground-level ozone formation. Each year, these could result in 246 to 468 avoided deaths from respiratory illnesses and 53,000-101,000 tons of avoided crop losses (with a value of $9.1-17.4 million globally).
    These scenarios also yield significant macroeconomic benefits over the 20-year analysis period, including increased GDP in Brazil of $13.3-$35.2 billion (net present value in 2010 dollars, using a 3 percent discount rate), with a corresponding growth in jobs of 44,000-110,000 depending on the scenario. In addition, 0.5-1.1 percent of national power demand is satisfied as an additional benefit in two of the scenarios. Summaries of the results are shown in Box 3.5 and Figure 3.8.
    
The net present value of the project is based on the estimated fees generated if all of Brazil’s solid waste is treated in sanitary landfills, less costs drawn from the recent report What a Waste (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012)—including purchasing, operations, maintenance, and debt service for each of the options explored. Potential program costs have not been considered here.
Summary and Conclusions
This case study shows that greater emissions reductions can be achieved using an integrated solid waste approach, which considers every step in the waste value chain, than by targeting only one technology (e.g., sanitary landfills). Although methane is emitted only at the point of waste treatment and disposal, efforts to reduce these emissions and manage waste as a resource can occur at every stage: planning, waste generation, collection, treatment, and disposal. Upstream efforts are especially valuable. For example, incentive schemes to reduce waste generation and increase source separation yield two types of SLCP reductions.

First, they directly reduce landfill methane (and other downstream GHG) emissions; second, they displace other sources of SLCP (and GHG) emissions (i.e., fertilizers and natural gas).
    Large-scale use of these waste-to-resource technologies requires major investments of $l-$2 billion per year in upstream waste reduction and source separation. Without separation of waste at the household diesel, neither composting nor anaerobic digestion is economically feasible Making these investments, however, would lead to significant economic returns. The NPV of such a project is estimated at approximately $100 billion. In addition, between $22-$52 billion in additional value stems from increased GDP, the social value of carbon (beyond carbon finance), reduced mortality, and improved crop yields. All these benefits should be considered in the economic analysis of such a project.
Development Project Case Study 3: Cleaner Cookstoves in Rural China
China has made great strides in expanding energy access and providing cleaner cooking fuels and improved stoves throughout the country However, about half of China’s population still relies on solid fuels (coal and biomass) for cooking and heating, and the International Energy Agency estimates 241 million people in China will continue to do so by 2030 (WorldEnergy Outlook 2013). Household air pollution from solid fuel use is estimated to cause more than one million premature deaths each year in China (Lirn et al. 2012). Switching to modem fuels would be the most effective way to reduce this pollution and health damage; these fuels are more expensive, however, and require more costly stoves and delivery infrastructure As a result, poorer rural households without access to affordable modem fuels such as liquid petroleum gas and natural gas are unlikely to transition on a large scale Effective interventions to scale up the dissemination of clean-burning, fuel- efficient stoves for household cooking and heating can mitigate the health hazards of burning solid fuels (World Bank 2013c).
Case Study Interventions
While heating systems and combined cooking and heating stoves also represent important sources of indoor and outdoor air pollution, in order to simplify the analysis, the focus here is only on cleaner cookstoves.
    This case study, based on a universal access to clean cooking scenario developed under the China Clean Stove Initiative (World Bank 2013 c), assumes® a publicly supported plan to encourage rural households to switch to more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly cookstoves starting in 2015. For the first five years, the public sector would support a 20 percent subsidy to rural households for the cost of the dean cookstoves in addition to substantial technical assistance funding. This temporary support is assumed to encourage a robust private market that would propel further deployment of cleaner stoves through 2C80, with households bearing the full cost. The 20 percent subsidy and program and technical assistance will cost $400 million over the program timeframe (2015-2020), supplemented by $1.2 billion in private sector investment, which takes into account reduced household spending in other areas in response to increases spending on cookstoves.
    This case study assumes that 40 percent of rural poor households relying primarily on solid fuels for cooking will have switched to cleaner stoves by 2020, and all households will have switched by 2030. This is against a backdrop of increasing urbanization and rising household incomes, which have already established a trend toward modern fuels and cleaner stoves.
    Based on these assumptions, more than 20 million subsidized stoves (improved biomass and clean-fuel cookstoves and solar cookers) would be deployed between 2015 and 2020, and more than 50 million unsubsidized stoves would be sold between 2020 and 2C60, significantly speeding up the naturally occurring transition to cleaner stoves.
Case Study Benefits
Deploying clean cooking solutions in China would reap many benefits, including improved health, energy savings, and private sector development opportunities. As estimated by the FASST tool, emissions reductions by the year 2(B0 of more than 480,000 tons of PM25 s would have very significant public health benefits. These in dude avoiding an estimated 87,900 premature deaths in that year from lung cancer and heart attacks, the majority (more than 85,000) in China. By 2030, $250 billion (85,000 lives times the estimated $3 million VSL) in avoided mortality could be realized in that year. These benefits are underestimated, however, because they only account for improvements in outdoor air quality; greater health benefits are expected due to improved household air quality, but tools to quantify these benefits are not available.®
    The large energy savings, especially from reduced coal use, would add more than $10 billion to the Chinese economy over the 20-year analysis period ending in 2033. The combined energy savings from biomass and coal builds by 2(BO to nearly 490 million gigajoules (GJ) annually, or about three percent of residential energy use. The increased consumer spending also yields j ob gains. A summary of the benefits is presented in Box3.6 and Figure 3.9.
Summary and Conclusions
A* plan to encourage rural households to switch to more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly cookstoves, by subsidizing and supporting deployment of more than 20 million cookstoves between 2015 and 2020, would have large health and energy benefits. It is estimated that more than 85,000 premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided annually in 2030 (more than one million lives over 20 years) in China alone. The net present value of these health benefits is more than $1.5 trillion in 2010 dollars. Recent studies suggest that more than one million premature deaths are attributed to household air pollution each year (Lim et al. 2012); thus the potential health benefits could be higher if household exposure were included. Large energy savings could also reduce energy costs nationwide, resulting in broad economic benefits of more than $10 billion over the analysis period. Finally, more than 20,000 new jobs could be created.
Development Project Case Study 4: Biogas Digesters and Photovoltaic Systems in Mexican Agriculture
According to Mexico’s Fifth National Communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, agriculture continues to be an important source of the country’s emissions (12% of its GHG emissions in 2010 including both methane and nitrous oxide), primarily from land-use changes, tillage, synthetic fertilizers, and anaerobic decomposition of organic materials. To reduce these emissions and improve the agricultural sector’s contribution to the overall economy, the government of Mexico has prioritized improvements in the sector’s energy efficiency, renewable energy, and biomass practices.
Case Study Interventions
This case study builds on the successful Mexico Sustainable Rural Development Project, a $100 million World Bank loan blended with a $10.5 million Global Environment Facility grant, with additional contributions from the Government of Mexico and project beneficiaries. The project supported a number of technologies, including biodigesters at pig and dairy farms. As of May 2013, 303 biodigesters had been installed, half at pig farms and half at dairy farms. These installations are driven by farmer demand, which is expected to grow as biodigester technology becomes more cost-effective and better adapted to different production scales.
    While the original project supports a range of energy-efficiency technologies, this case study focuses exclusively on continued deployment of biodigesters at pig and dairy farms, plus motogenerators and photovoltaic systems on dairy farms, where milk-cooling systems favor the added expense of electrical generation add-ons. The case study assumes that public funding is available to continue leveraging private sector investment in these technologies through 2031, when 90 percent of pig and dairy herds (estimated at 15 million head of pig and 3.2 million head of dairy cattle) would have added manure biodigestion capacity, with generators and PV systems included on the dairy farms.
Case Study Benefits
The project benefits include reduced methane emissions, which lower global background ground-level ozone and related health and agricultural damage. By recovering methane from biodigesters and flaring it or using it to generate electricity, C02e emissions are reduced by 9.4 million tons per year in 2030. Estimated annual benefits include 180 avoided premature deaths from air pollution (but relatively few within Mexico) and 39,000 tons of avoided crop losses worth more than $6 million (mostly outside Mexico). Other benefits include new job creation and improved sanitary conditions due to manure treatment.
    The net present value of the project is based on the carbon finance value of the reduced methane emissions, equivalent to nine million tons of annual C02e reductions by 2030 (103 MtC02e cumulatively) and worth more than $1 billion over the 20-year program (less costs of about $600 million). Based on the social cost of carbon, however, this project’s emissions reductions are worth $3.2 billion ($2.2 billion higher than the carbon finance value). The results are summarized in Box 3.7 and shown in Figure 3.10.
Summary and Conclusions
Sustained investment that achieves 90 percent penetration of manure biodigesters across all the pig and dairy farms and 90 percent penetration of photovoltaic systems across all dairy farms in Mexico would derive significant economic, public health, agricultural, and environmental benefits. In addition, policy reforms to allow farmers to sell excess electricity generated to the power company could produce even larger benefits.
    While the project economic analysis assumes a carbon finance value of more than $1 billion, these emissions reductions are more completely represented by the social cost of carbon, which values the reductions at $3.2 billion—in other words, an extra $2.2 billion in welfare value above the finance value. Increased productivity from energy savings adds an additional $1.1 billion in economic benefit; global health and agricultural benefits are monetized at about $4.2 billion. This suggests that more than 17 times the stated project value is not recognized through current practices.
Lessons and Conclusions from the Case Studies
This chapter demonstrates the use of an integrated framework to analyze the multiple development benefits of efforts to mitigate climate change and protect air quality. Both regional policy changes and national development projects are analyzed using the framework; the aim is to demonstrate its efficacy as a tool for local and national policymakers, development organizations, philanthropies, analysts, and others.
    
Since the policy-based case studies and the project-based case studies cover different regions and use slightly different metrics, direct comparisons and a summation of benefits are not possible. For instance, the policy interventions are presented in terms of their annual impact in 2C8 0; the project interventions are presented as the aggregate impact over a 20-year assumed life of the project. Either way, a snapshot summary of each case study shows that significant benefits can be realized.
    The first three case studies demonstrate the effects of key sector policy interventions and determine the benefits® realized in six regions (the U.S., China, the EU, India, Mexico, and Brazil) and the impact on global GDP. A useful way to view these benefits is to compare them against a similar metric, in this case a metric ton of CO.,e abated in 2030 (seeTable3.1). For example, the transport sector would realize a net return on mitigation of $169 per ton of C02e, even without accounting for the health or GDP benefits. In the buildings sector, where the interventions have the highest costs among the three sectors, the health and GDP benefits are substantial enough to cover the costs. The industrial sector is the most promising in terms of benefits compared with abatement costs. Although crop benefits are not included for transportation or buildings, these benefits would be substantial if a wider suite of emissions data were available (see footnote 52 in Annex C).
    Translating the aggregated health, agriculture, and energy benefits for all sector policies into monetary values yields the results shown in Table 3.2.
    The project-based case studies examine several sub-national development projects, scaled up to the national level. A sampling of the benefits of these projects is shown in Table 3.3. A striking result of this analysis is that these projects have significant additional value well beyond the already significant stated project benefits.



    Added value provides a useful rationale for improving economic analysis, but it may not be the most important way to view the multiple benefits derived by the project-based case studies. Table 3.4 provides an alternative view of the same benefits, categorized as global public goods or local socioeconomic benefits. As the table shows, interventions that reduce methane lead to large global public goods with respect to C02e reductions, health, and agriculture, whereas measures that reduce particulate matter and black carbon have larger local health benefits. All lead to positive economic benefits over the 20-year investment period examined in this analysis.
    Grouping the multiple benefits this way makes it easier to recognize the contributions countries can make to greening their own growth in addition to benefits that accrue to the rest of the World.
    None of the case studies includes the value of reduced climate change impacts, such as damage caused by more-intense storms, higher storm surges and sea levels, and damaged ecosystems.
    While these results may indicate significant costs or benefits in one sector or region versus another, they do not show the integrated impact of all the emissions reduction measures available across sectors and the corresponding inter-sectoral interactions. A more integrated analysis would allow a better understanding of how savings in one sector can be reinvested to cover costs in other sectors to yield overall economic growth. Such synergistic benefits could be greater than the sum of the individual benefits.42
    In addition, the full benefits of reduced emissions are not captured in this study due to the limited data in the MACC model (see Annex C for a discussion of the significantly underestimated benefits, based on recent research). As a result, the labor and agricultural productivity benefits (from greater longevity, fewer work days lost to illness, and reduced crop damage) were not included in the macroeconomic analyses because of their small size relative to the impact across the overall workforce. A recent analysis by Sanderson et al. (2013) demonstrates that such effects can be large enough to recoup the entire cost of mitigation. These types of integrated scenarios using a systems approach with additional macroeconomic linkages should be investigated in future work.



Conclusions and Next Steps






The growing cost of environmental degradation in many developing countries is impeding progress toward achieving the World Bank's twin goals of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity. According to a recent study, 5.7 percent of India’s GDP in 2009 was lost to environmental degradation, with almost 3.3 percent attributed to air pollution emissions (World Bank 2013b). In China, serious air pollution has become a restricting bottleneck for regional socioeconomic development (CAAC 2013). Developing countries like India and China recognize the concurrent need to reduce air pollution, improve access to affordable energy and convenient transportation, address climate change, and grow their economies. China’s “12th Five-Year Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions” places economic development at the center of its air quality management plans; India’s 12th Five-Year Plan (Planning Commission, Government of India, 2013) acknowledges a need to establish “green national accounts” to measure the true costs of environmental degradation and to acknowledge the full benefits of reduced emissions.
    As international development organizations, philanthropies, and others support developing countries in prioritizing climate project and policy interventions to close the greenhouse gas “emissions gap,” improved analysis is needed to identify ways to leverage synergies among interventions, reduce costs, and maximize local socioeconomic benefits.
    This report puts forth a holistic framework to estimate the multiple benefits of reduced emissions of several pollutants. Including the value of these benefits in economic analysis provides a fuller accounting of the true value of policies and programs and makes a stronger case for coordinated climate and development action. Further, it demonstrates the application of the framework using sectoral case studies at the policy and project level and at national

and regional scales. By doing so, the report shows that national and international policymakers, finance organizations, and others can strengthen their estimation of the multiple benefits of such policies and projects. Furthermore, quantifying the benefits can facilitate support from different constituencies, including those interested in public health and food and energy security. Such improved analyses can also advance international discussions on the most effective ways to avoid the risks of a 4°C warmer world.
    The framework presented in this report, like most first time efforts, has some limitations: the framework uses a patchwork of tools that were not designed to seamlessly integrate with one another; it does not account for behavioral issues, such as modal choice in public transit; and it does not explicitly account for the costs of the climate change impacts of these emissions. In addition to addressing these limitations, the framework could be strengthened through additional work:
• Further benefits assessments based on more comprehensive emissions data.
• Macroeconomic analysis to reflect the benefits of green versus non-green investment options.
• Better assessment of tradeoffs, such as between higher costs and productivity gains.
• Better assessment of risks to avoid locking-in development on the wrong path.
• Inclusion of welfare gains and other non-quantifiable benefits (such as equity and inclusion) in macroeconomic analysis.
    Making the framework functional at the sub-national project level faces additional challenges. For example, integrating health

and agriculture benefits into the economic analysis of individual projects (rather than using the global macroeconomic model as has been done in this report) may require a more tailored approach. Local benefits—such as time savings, gender equality, and social inclusion—may also need to be incorporated. Because not all these benefits are quantifiable, a hybrid approach may be needed. These challenges can be overcome if sub-national project teams start testing this framework in partnership with local counterparts to refine it.
    
Finally, the preparation of this report included consultative workshops in China and India where the demand for such a framework was strongly articulated by local policy makers and other stakeholders. The consultations identified the need for decision makers at the national and sub-national level to be sensitized to the idea of a framework that can help quantify multiple benefits so that they can consider using it as part of their economic rationale for policies and projects.

Climate Change and Migration
Evidence from the Middle East and North Africa

Overview
Quentin Wodon and Andrea Liverani

Climate change and migration are major concerns in the MENA region, yet the empirical evidence on the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on migration remains limited. Information is broadly lacking on how households in vulnerable areas perceive changes in the climate, how they are affected by extreme weather events, whether they benefit from community and government programs to help them cope with and adapt to a changing climate, and how these conditions influence the decision of household members to migrate, either temporarily or permanently. This introductory chapter summarizes briefly the main results of the study which relied on existing data as well as focus groups and new household surveys collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. The results suggest that households do perceive important changes in the climate, and that many households are being affected by extreme weather events resulting in losses in income, crops, and livestock. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with weather shocks are diverse, but also limited, with most households not able to recover from the negative impact of weather shocks. The ability of community-level responses and government programs to support households is also very limited. Finally, while climate change is not today the main driver of migration flows, it does appear to contribute to these flows, and worsening climatic conditions are likely to exacerbate future migration flows.
Introduction
Do households living in climate-affected areas in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region believe that changes in climate patterns and their environment are taking place? Have households been affected by extreme weather events, and in that case to what extent and which events have had the largest impact? What are the coping strategies that households declare having used, or could be using to cope with climate change and weather shocks? To what extent are perceived and actual changes in weather patterns and the environment driving temporary and permanent migration flows in MENA countries? Finally, to what extent do remittances reach households living in climate poor areas, and what is the impact of such remittances on poverty and human development indicators?

It is widely acknowledged that the MENA region will be strongly affected by climate change, and yet the current evidence on the relationship between climate change and migration in the MENA region is weaker than in most other regions (see Foresight 2011). This study is not meant to review the limited evidence on climate change in the MENA region, nor does it provide specific policy recommendations (for a recent study doing just that, see Verner 2012; on the evidence and policies related to climate change worldwide, see World Bank 2010; and on migration, see Foresight 2011). The aim of the study is more modest: it is to provide new empirical evidence on the relationship between weather patterns, perceptions of climate change, and migration so that at least partial answers can be provided to the questions asked above.
This introductory overview chapter summarizes the main results of the study. A more detailed synthesis is provided in chapter 1 (Wodon et al. 2013). The study is based in part on new household surveys collected in 2011 in climate-affected areas in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen. On purpose, in order to achieve variability in the data collected, the selection of the countries and areas sampled within countries included some countries and areas highly vulnerable to droughts, as is the case in Syria, and others much less vulnerable, as is the case in Egypt (given that Egypt's agriculture is mostly irrigated). The sample of countries also included low income countries such as the Republic of Yemen, and higher-income countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Moroco, and Syria. Finally, the sample included countries and areas affected by diverse types of extreme weather events, including both droughts and floods (for example in some areas of Morocco).
Beyond survey data collection generating quantitative data, the study also relies in part on qualitative focus groups implemented in both urban and rural areas in the five countries in 2011. In addition, some of the analysis is based on previously existing survey data for Morocco, as well as survey and census data for the Republic of Yemen. The context that led to the study and the literature to which it contributes, as well as the approach used for both quantitative and qualitative data collection are discussed in chapters 2 and 3. This introduction focuses on the main empirical results which are provided in a series of technical papers in chapters 4 through 12.
One important caveat is required before presenting the main results. It is sometimes said that ""Climate is what we expect. Weather is what we get."" Simply put, climate relates to the distribution of variables such as temperature and rainfall over a period of time, often 30 years at least. This distribution is characterized by its moments, including the mean and the variance of key climatic variables. Climate change is then used to refer to the change in the distribution of rainfall and temperature. However, it is difficult to tell if the weather experienced at any point in time is due to a change in climate (the overall mean and variance of rainfall and temperature) or is simply part of an existing distribution. The implication for this study is that our results do not provide clear new evidence on the direct relationship between climate change and migration per se, but the results do contribute to the evidence on three specific related issues: (1) the impact of weather shocks on migration; (2) the impact of perceptions of recent climate
change on migration; and (3) the impact of climate patterns (but not directly climate change) on migration.

Perceptions and Impacts of Weather Shocks on Households
Do households living in rural areas susceptible of being affected by climate change believe that changes in climate patterns are taking place? Questions on perceptions of climate change and migration were asked with a focus on events and changes that took place in the last five years, bur the analysis of migration is done both for the last five years and for longer periods.
Table O.1 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a) suggests that indeed households do believe that the climate has been changing in recent years. In the combined sample for the five countries where new household surveys were implemented, more than three fourths of households declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters say that temperatures are higher. Between half and two thirds declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent. The changes in climate in turn appear to lead to more diseases in animals and livestock, more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion. Some of the extreme weather events associated with climate change such as rainstorms and floods are not perceived as more frequent by a majority of households, and in some cases, households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler, and that there is more rain, but this is a minority of households. But overall, while there are differences between households and areas or countries, there is a clear perception that the climate is worsening.
In focus groups as well the majority of respondents mentioned long-term shifts in climate and they attributed declining agriculture fortunes to deteriorating environmental conditions caused by changing weather patterns (Grant et al. 2014). For crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results may be devastating: ""Rice is burnt in some seasons, because we cannot find enough water to irrigate it"" (Male,

36­45 years old, Egypt1). The inability to earn a stable income for crops makes it difficult to rely solely on agriculture as a source of revenue. ""The conditions [for] farming are very poor. There's drought on the one hand and the unavailability of the new equipment and poor methods we use on the other hand. ... All farmers in this region have been affected by the drought and lost their yields"" (Male, 35­45 years old, Algeria). In the Republic of Yemen, residents from Hudaydah emphasized the problems of warm weather and increasing heat waves. Furthermore, unfavorable crop prices have led some growers to shift from cultivating food crops to qat which is more profitable but requires a great deal of water: ""People there [in villages] work shoulder to shoulder, but the problem lies in agriculture. They have stopped cultivating crops ... and replaced them with qat"" (Male, 30­39 years old, the Republic of Yemen). Importantly, as shown in table O.2, many households are affected by weather shocks, especially in terms of crop and income losses, but also in terms of losses in livestock and less fish caught.
Additional information on perceptions about the climate, weather shocks, and their impact on households is available for Morocco through special modules on climate change and shocks incorporated in a national survey implemented in 2009/10 (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a). In the survey, as shown in table O.3, 28.1 percent of households were involved in agriculture, and among those 92.1 percent declared having been affected by deteriorating climatic conditions in the last five years. The most likely shock was a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall, mentioned by 62.2 percent of agricultural households. In a separate part of the survey, more than one in five households declared having been affected by a recent weather shock such as a drought or flood. Most of the households that were affected declared that they had not been able to recover from the shock, and this was especially the case among poorer households. According to regression analysis, households in the top quintile of wealth were 20 percentage points more likely to recover from weather shocks than households in the bottom quintile.

Coping and Adaptation Strategies
What are the coping strategies that households declare having used, or could be using to cope with climate change and weather shocks? In the five country sample, 60.6 percent of households declare that they have used or would use their savings, 46.8 have sold or would sell their assets, 46.2 percent have asked
for a loan or would do so, 40.6 percent have sold or would sell their livestock, and 36.4 percent have withdrawn or would withdraw their children from school (Adoho and Wodon 2014b). The proportions of households resorting to these coping strategies are higher among lower quintiles which have fewer other means to cope. There are differences between countries, especially regarding the possibility of withdrawing children from school--in Egypt this is not being considered by most households. Also, households receiving international remittances, which tend to be better off, are less likely to resort to these various coping strategies, except using their savings. The qualitative focus groups also reveal different coping strategies, including selling assets, shifting food consumption habits, and removing children from school to have them support the household (Grant et al. 2014).
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes. As shown in table O.4 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b), between one in four and one in five households have relied or would rely more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought or would seek off-farm work, have used or would use more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made or would make a change in their farm production technology. Undertaking training for non-farmwork or changing crop mixes and varieties is mentioned by about 15 percent of households, versus only 9 percent for changing the crops versus livestock mix. Thus most households do not implement many adaptation strategies. However more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of the community due to climate pressures, and 14 percent say that some people have moved in, which may generate conflict over water, land, or livestock.

The qualitative work suggests that residents often rely on each other to cope and adapt: ""Rural residents are willing to pay [give] half of what we have to help others. If I have 10 pounds, I will pay 5. If I have 100 pounds, I will pay 50. This is how the social norms work here. We are all one family"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Egypt). Yet solidarity does not always work, and conflicts over natural resources do occur due to changes in climate, as the estimates in table O.3 show. In the Republic of Yemen in particular, rural residents worried in the focus groups that water scarcity has led to conflict over access to wells. One woman described a water distribution scheme where water is distributed to certain communities on certain days of the week. For farmers in all five countries, living in impoverished rural areas is not only difficult financially, but it also has negative impacts for health, a concern mentioned in Egyptian focus groups. Farmers may be increasingly exposed to contaminated water because waste leaks into irrigation canals. Others mention being sick. With only limited income at their disposal, many households cannot afford quality health care and they also often cannot access health facilities (Grant et al. 2013).
What about community-level responses? Households were asked whether to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which they live did any of the following: planting trees or installing soil protection measures; building banks on rivers, streams, or small check banks to reduce flooding; developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation, or roads; gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income, or livestock; taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts; and taking action to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment. In most cases community action is limited. As shown by Adoho and Wodon (2014b), only one in five households declare that the community has planted trees or taken soil erosion measures, and one in seven mentioned measures to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment. The other actions are mentioned by only one in ten households or less.
Similar questions were asked about governments, albeit with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the
provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low. Except for the provision of drinking water which is probably less related to climate change and shocks, government involvement in adaptation strategies and safety nets is also limited. For most programs, only about one in ten households declared that the government has been active.
The fact that community and government programs to help households cope with weather shocks and adapt to climate change are the exception rather than the rule was also a conclusion of the qualitative work. When asked about such programs, respondents said that they were aware of few programs and organizations geared toward assisting the rural poor affected by climate change. Participants suggested areas where government initiatives could help, such as the provision of agricultural inputs or loans to purchase machinery. Job training and improved employment opportunities were also mentioned. Yet some respondents, especially in the Republic of Yemen, were doubtful that government program would bear fruit, due to corruption and distrust.

Migration
Migration is also a widespread strategy to cope with and adapt to changes in climatic and environmental conditions. In the five country sample, the data suggest that three in every 10 households (29.9 percent) have migrants, whether residents (current members of the households) or nonresidents (former members of the household). Lower rates are obtained when restricting migration to the last five years. At the individual level, 7.6 percent of individuals in the sample as a whole have migrated temporarily, and the proportion over the last five years is 6.2 percent. For permanent migration, the rates are 8.0 percent in the sample as a whole, and 5.7 percent in the last five years (Adoho and Wodon 2014c). Most migration is internal, but the likelihood of migration abroad is high in Egypt and also in general higher for individuals from higher quintiles, as expected due to the cost of international migration. For both residents and nonresidents, migration to urban areas, and especially to large cities, is much more likely than migration to rural areas.
To what extent are households migrating away from climate-affected areas, and is climate itself a key push factor in such migration? This is a complex question. Regression results suggest that poor climate and extreme weather events lead to a higher probability of migration, but the role of climate is smaller than that of socioeconomic characteristics and job prospects in cities. More precisely, data from the five country sample are used by Adoho and Wodon (2014c) to construct two indices or factors that summarize household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment. The first factor captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts. The second factor captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods. Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one.
In the regression analysis with the five country sample, higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of resident or temporary migration, with the coefficients being statistically significant and the effects of each of the two factors of a similar order of magnitude. The effects for nonresident or permanent migration are similar, although statistically significant only for the whole period, as opposed to the last five years. Thus overall higher values for both factors result in higher rates of both temporary and permanent migration, but with weaker evidence for permanent migration. The regression estimates suggest that a significant deterioration of climatic conditions would lead to an increase of about 1.5 percentage point for both types of migration. Given the overall migration rate, this increase would represent between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed, and its magnitude is of an order of magnitude similar to that obtained when considering the reasons stated by households for the migration of some of their members.
Additional evidence for Morocco from Nguyen and Wodon (2014b) using the national survey for 2009/10 mentioned earlier suggest that weather shocks increase the likelihood of temporary migration by slightly more than one percentage point, an order of magnitude again similar to that observed in the five country sample. While in the Morocco national survey, the impact of weather shocks on permanent migration is not statistically significant, the impact of changing structural conditions such as reduced agricultural yields due to lack of water is, and it does contribute to higher permanent migration away from the affected areas. Finally, using a different approach based on combining census and weather station data from the Republic of Yemen, Joseph and Wodon (2014a) find that climate variables do affect migration from some districts to other districts, but in a somewhat limited way, with socioeconomic and cost factors playing a much more prominent role. This analysis, which is based on past data, suggest that migration flows are unlikely to increase sharply in the near term, but if conditions were to change drastically, the effect of weather variables on migration could become much larger (Joseph, Wodon, and Blankespoor 2014).
The focus groups data reported in Grant et al. (2013) also suggest a link between climate and migration, although again the role of socioeconomic factors is probably at least as important as that of climatic conditions. Respondents linked migration to chronic droughts which lead to declining agricultural productivity: ""The lack of water has resulted in a failure to be able to cultivate rice and it is an important crop"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). On the other hand, few mentioned flooding or being displaced as a result of natural disasters as a reason for relocation. Respondents appear to choose migration after other strategies have proven unsuccessful. The qualitative work also suggests that remittances are important, especially in the Republic of Yemen where there is a long-standing tradition of migration to Saudi Arabia. But conversely consequences can be severed in the absence of remittances: ""My brother is in Saudi Arabia. He used to send me money all of the time and we were well off, even when I wasn't working. [But] we lost the house and everything we [owned] because of the discontinuity of these aids. We live at God's mercy"" (Male, 30­45 years old, Hudaydah, the
Republic of Yemen). Participants in focus groups from Morocco and Algeria did not depend on remittances as much. Though urban residents in Algeria, Morocco, Syria, and Egypt overwhelmingly report sending remittances back home, the Republic of Yemeni urban respondents by contrast were more likely to receive remittances from family members working abroad, especially again from Saudi Arabia.
What happens to the migrants once they leave? Many migrants hope to work and save enough to own their own business (a small store or shop). Finding jobs, however, is not an easy feat amid widespread joblessness found throughout the region, given that unemployment levels hover around 15 percent, and a much higher 20­40 percent among youth 15­30 years old. While some migrants find urban communities receptive, others say they were met with hostility: ""They look at us and call us `Berber countrymen.' They think we are invaders"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco). Some rural migrants said that they felt disadvantaged vis-à-vis urban dwellers because they lacked what is needed to secure proper employment, especially a degree and French- and Arabic-speaking capability, both of which tend to be needed even for jobs requiring minimal skills. For the Republic of Yemenis, the main obstacle to finding a job may be corruption, which appears to be deep and pervasive: ""You need to bribe your way into a position"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa). Finding adequate housing was also a challenge: ""I'm 39, married, with five kids and I don't have a flat of my own. I pay 300 Egyptian pounds per month and cannot have a flat. Why don't they grant me one? They say you have to rent for just one year, and then it all depends on the owner"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). ""We live on top of each other. There's no privacy. Sometimes you get your money stolen"" (Male, 18­25 Casablanca, Morocco).
Established communities that share potential migrants' lineage, tribe, or ethnic background ease the transition. Many focus group respondents spoke of relying on relatives or family friends as an intermediary for finding a job and a place to live. Networks also ease feelings of isolation. Participants mentioned that they now have only limited interactions with their neighbors, if they are fortunate to know them at all. In the words of one Egyptian woman: ""Neighbors are close in the villages. Here [in Cairo], I don't know my neighbors, what their job is or how they live"" (Female, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). They also lamented the shift of emphasis away from family and traditions. Crime and harassment were also mentioned. Yet while life in the city is more ""chaotic,"" it is also exciting and full of opportunity. In Morocco, for example, migration appeared to widen the options available to young immigrants as young respondents expressed a greater sense of independence, belonging, and self-actualization.
Table O.5 summarizes in a very stylized way the main results from the analysis. The evidence suggests that worsening climatic conditions, or the perceptions thereof, are clearly a push factor leading to temporary migration away from the affected (mostly rural), but the evidence is a bit weaker for permanent migration. It must be noted that in an analysis such as that of Joseph and Wodon (2014a), which is at the level of a country as a whole, the impact of the climate on the
overall patterns of migration tends to be diluted. By contrast, in the analysis based on the five countries sample, as well as when looking at weather shocks with the national Morocco survey, the effects are estimated mostly on those affected by these shocks, which also explains why the impacts are larger in affected areas. In those areas, it seems fair to suggest that climatic conditions account for at least 10­20 percent of the current migration flows, and this could increase in the future.

Remittances
The last part of the study includes two chapters looking at remittances in the case of the Republic of Yemen. There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms. It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks. The first chapter in the last part of the study by Joseph, Wodon, and Blankespoor (2014) use a national household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received. The question is whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances. The results suggest that this is not the case in the Republic of Yemen.
In the last chapter of the study, Joseph and Wodon (2014b) use matching techniques and the same household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition). The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate. Four main results are obtained. First, remittances--which are substantial in the Republic of Yemen--tend to have
positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition. Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances. Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable. Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment. Thus, in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances may be used more for investments, including in the education of children.

Conclusion and Policy Implications
A solid foundation for decision making related to climate change adaptation involves four iterative steps: (1) Assessing climate risks, impacts, and opportunities for action; (2) Prioritizing policy and project options; (3) Implementing responses in sectors and regions; and (4) Monitoring and evaluating implementation, then reassessing the climate risks, impacts, and opportunities (Verner 2012). Our work falls squarely within the first of these four steps. As mentioned in the introduction, the aim of this study was to contribute to a better understanding of perceptions of climate change, environmental degradation, and extreme weather events and their relationship to migration and other coping strategies in the MENA region. Quantitative and qualitative data collection activities were implemented in climate-affected areas in five countries, and existing census and survey data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen were used as well. The analysis suggests that a majority of households do perceive important changes in the climate, such as more erratic rain, higher temperatures, less rain, dryer and less fertile land, and more frequent droughts.
These changes have led to a range of negative consequences for agriculture and livestock production, and extreme weather events have been associated with losses in incomes, crops, and livestock. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse, including migration, selling various assets and taking other emergency measures to get by, as well as changing the household's sources of livelihoods in terms of crops, livestock production, and off-farm work among others. Yet many households do not appear to use these strategies, and in addition the extent to which they benefit from community and government programs and initiatives to help them cope with weather or environmental changes is limited.
In terms of migration, the study suggests that the impact of weather shocks and deteriorating conditions on migration is positive, leading to higher temporary and
permanent migration. In the areas most affected by climate change, the analysis suggests that climate factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climatic conditions continue to deteriorate. Furthermore, while many migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and their ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed, especially given intense competition for relatively few good job opportunities.
Beyond addressing an existing research gap though, the findings provide much ground for policy development. Five broad areas of implications for policy are highlighted below.
First, affected communities call for more government action to help with adaptation. In line with the conclusions reached in the recent study led by Verner (2012) on adaptation in the MENA region, we have shown the extent to which households in vulnerable rural areas are affected by climate change and weather shocks, and how their ability to cope and adapt to these shocks is limited. The cost of climate change and weather shocks is already felt today by many rural households, which are essentially left on their own in the absence of strong community responses and government programs in the geographic areas studied. While we have not conducted any cost-benefit analysis to assess which types of programs might help households the most in rural sending areas--such analysis would need to take local conditions into account, we have demonstrated the need for more assistance in order to help households cope and adapt, given the substantial damage already caused to livelihoods by changing weather patterns. The populations sampled in this study perceive a lack of effective government interventions to address the impacts of climate change and the migration it generates, and collective action solutions do not seem to work. The gap in the public provision and financing of adaption interventions leaves individuals and communities alone in making choices and decisions, including through migration. Although this leaves space for private initiatives, it also leaves the space vulnerable to forms of uncoordinated action that may lead to conflict and maladaptation.
The role of safety nets and broader social protection programs is especially important in this context, both for migrants and their families in sending areas. MENA governments should be encouraged to adopt and expand the coverage of their social protection and safety net programs. The coverage of those programs appears very thin in the areas surveyed for this study. Investments in safety net systems could have immediate pay-offs in the short run as well as in the long run when the consequences of climatic change may become more obvious. In addition, it would be important to highlight the fact that the design, coverage, and placement of safety net programs would not be just for the purpose of minimizing the future impacts of climate change; instead safety nets should be seen as an integral part of the governments' broader strategy toward poverty reduction and urbanization and they should provide portable skills and human capital to the segments of the population that need it the most (we come back to this below).
Second, migration policy needs to understand and address climate-induced migration in the context of other push and pull factors. The study has shown that while environmental and climatic factors do play a role in driving migration, a range of other socioeconomic factors are at play. Although uncertainties remain as to the magnitude of future climate change and its effects on migration, focusing on environmental degradation alone as the dominant driver of migration would be misleading. Similarly, characterizing environmental degradation as key driver of transborder migration is also potentially misleading: in the countries studies, when environmental factors play a role, migration is mostly internal. These findings run somewhat against the received wisdom behind much of the recent global hype around climate migration, but they are in line with the results of other assessments, including the recently released Foresight report on environmental change and migration (Foresight 2011). Identifying climate migration more squarely as a domestic policy issue will lead to a different type of attention to the problem for both domestic policy makers in MENA countries and donors alike.
Third, migration can be conceived of as a form of adaptation, but it is often seen as a solution of last resort by households, especially in the qualitative work presented in this study. One reason for this is that migration may be perceived as more costly than other strategies such as using savings, selling assets, getting into debt, or withdrawing children from school. In addition to material costs (travelling and relodging), migration implies substantial risks due to unknown outcomes (finding other forms of livelihood) in addition to immaterial costs such those as stemming from the uprooting of individuals, households, and sometimes even communities. In some cases, those left behind, whether at the level of the household or the community may be precluded from reaping the benefits from migration, especially when remittances are hampered by the high cost of remitting or by the fact that migrants have a hard time finding jobs.
At the same time policy responses and development interventions need to recognize that migration represents a viable and legitimate mechanism through which people can address risks to their livelihoods and wider well-being, and a means of adapting to climate change and its impacts. A key question for migration policy is therefore where migration should be treated as a risk to be managed and mitigated, and where it should be treated as an opportunity to be facilitated or even encouraged. Enabling communities in sending areas to better leverage the potential benefits of migration and increase their adaptive capacity is often a better alternative than their progressive displacement. The effective economic insertion of migrants in urban areas leads to opportunities for the sending communities, particularly thanks to the transfer of remittances. For example, the evidence from the surveys and the qualitative work suggests a positive impact of remittances in areas affected by climate shocks, especially in terms of human development outcomes. Without a facilitating environment though, remittances are too often turned into pure consumption and the accumulation of nonproductive assets. This type of assets can be of little value both in terms of preventive and ex-post adaptation, as their investment contribution is limited and they are not liquid enough to be used when climate impacts strike, at which point their value
can drop. Policy should focus on leveraging the impacts of remittances by encouraging their productive use, for instance by subsidizing forms of defiscalization for remittance-funded investments and community saving schemes which also facilitate financial integration and increase liquidity.
Fourth, urban development policy is a fundamental component of the policy package to address climate induced migration. Most of the study focuses on sending areas, but the qualitative work conducted in urban areas suggests that the integration of migrants into major destination cities is not working as well as it should. The study shows that climate-induced migration tends to be toward cities, mostly large ones. The policy responses to climate shocks and migration are therefore to be found in cities as much as in sending areas. Concerns about employment and housing abound among migrants, with migration simply adding to existing pressures that can be dealt with only through broad-based economic development not necessarily focused on migration per se. The climate induced migration problem should be part of a broader policy debate about urbanization. Most MENA countries are rapidly urbanizing. While the share of the urban population in the region was at 48 percent in 1980, it almost reached 60 percent in 2000 and is expected to reach 70 percent by 2015. The way MENA policy makers will address the challenges posed by climate-induced migration is related to how they will manage to promote an urbanization model that welcomes the contribution of migrants to the development of cities.
Fifth, policy should focus on providing migrants with the portable skills and capabilities they need to fully exploit the adaptation potential of migration. All too often the policy debate focuses on whether migration should be encouraged or not. The study has shown that climate-induced migration is already taking place. It must therefore be accompanied. The provision of education and training can help potential migrants better grasp labor market opportunities both in sending and receiving areas, adapt to new living conditions, and shift more easily among jobs in different sectors. An emphasis on basic and portable skills would be effective regardless of the causes, timing, and destination of the migration decisions involved. And it would benefit not only those that leave, but also those that decide to stay or eventually return.
Sixth, while dealing with climate-induced migration will require some interventions specifically aimed at migrants, the policy package needed to deal with both climate change and migration is much broader. This is both a challenge and an opportunity. This is an opportunity because several levers can be applied to better leverage migration's potential for adaptation and development. But this is also a challenge because an integrated policy response will require a level of coordination and commitment that is likely to arise only through broader governance reforms and strong political leadership in MENA countries.
Finally, it is worth investigating how safeguards could play a role in reducing the risk that development initiatives result in negative impacts. For example, could inadvertent increases in the vulnerability of certain groups take place as a by-product of policies and projects that may or may not address climate change directly, such as adaptation initiatives involving resettlement and relocation? Is
there a risk of maladaptation associated with interventions that are founded on unjustified assumptions about future climatic conditions and may thereby increase dependence or pressure on resources threatened by climate change? How to design safeguard mechanisms is a complex issue, if only because policy responses related to migration differ depending on whether one considers sudden-onset climate-related disasters or long-term climate-related environmental changes. But the fact that such safeguard mechanisms are needed is not itself in question.

CHAPTER 1
Quentin Wodon, Nicholas Burger, Audra Grant, and Andrea Liverani

Climate change is a major source of concern in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and migration is often understood as one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions, including extreme weather events. Other coping and adaptation strategies include changing the household's sources of livelihood, and selling assets or taking other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events. Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide, the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of survey and other data. This chapter is based in large part on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. Household surveys were implemented in two climate-affected areas in each country. In addition, qualitative focus groups were also implemented in both urban and rural areas. Finally, complementary work was completed using existing data sources for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen. The chapter provides a summary of some of the main findings from these various sources of data, focusing on household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events, migration, other household coping and adaptation strategies, and government and community responses. Overall, households do perceive important changes in the climate, and many have been affected by extreme weather events with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse but limited, as are the community and government programs which could help households better cope with and adapt to climate change. In terms of migration, in the areas affected by climate change and weather shocks, the analysis suggests that climate factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climatic conditions continue to deteriorate. While migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed.

Introduction
By the next century, global mean annual temperatures may increase by 3°C to 5°C. In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region this may manifest itself through reduced rainfall, greater seasonal temperature variability, and a rise in the Mediterranean sea level, all of which constitute threats to agricultural production and economic security (Verner 2012). Agriculture employs about half of the active population in many countries, especially among the poor. Declining precipitation is likely to affect availability and usage of water, causing agricultural productivity to decrease (UNDP 2009; World Bank 2010). Climate change is also associated with a higher likelihood of extreme temperatures, floods, and droughts, and thereby with health risks as well as risks of substantial displacement (for example, Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009).1
Estimates of the number of people likely to be affected by climate change and the extent to which they are likely to be affected are notoriously difficult to provide (Foresight 2011). But in the MENA region as a whole, some 80­100 million people may be expected to experience water stress by 2025 (Warren et al. 2006). By 2050 water availability per capita is expected to decline by 50 percent. Furthermore, while the literature is mixed on this issue, aside from the economic impacts climate change may be associated with local conflict as groups compete for access to scarce natural resources (Nordas and Gleditsch 2007; Reuveny 2007). Some of the evidence in this chapter does point in that direction. Climate change also presents unique gender challenges. MENA migrants, whether internal or external, are overwhelmingly male, so that women are left to assume the burden of increased workload at the place of origin. And for those women who do migrate, job opportunities tend to be less attractive than those for their male counterparts.
This study focuses on the link between climate change and migration. Migration is considered as one of several coping and adaptation mechanisms used by households. It responds to both push and pull factors. Changes in the climate (for example, warming temperatures, heat waves, declining rain fall, and rising water levels) are part of push factors because they lead to a deterioration of the environment. Extreme climactic conditions, such as weather shocks like severe floods or droughts, can lead to temporary migration and displacement. Climate and subsequent environmental degradation decreases agricultural crop production, livestock, or water availability, which adversely affects economic activity. By contrast pull factors are those conditions that attract migrants or potential migrants, mainly to urban areas. They also shape and guide human choice. Thus the existence of economic opportunities such as employment, well-established community networks that help reduce uncertainty and risk, and available housing may all be variables that pull migrants to a particular area. Schools, health care, electricity, clean water, functioning sewage systems, and other infrastructural features inform decisions as well.
While the environment generates push factors because of threats to household livelihood (Kniveton et al. 2009), the decision to migrate is filtered through

household characteristics such as socioeconomic status, political context, and migrant networks (Black et al. 2011; Carr 2005). Migration can be permanent or temporary. It can be undertaken by a single individual or by an entire household, over a long or short distance. Similarly, environmental impacts can take an acute form, such as flooding or sand storms, or occur gradually via deforestation or changes in temperature and precipitation. These various dimensions render the analysis of migration complex (Kniveton et al. 2009).
The complex temporal and spatial dimensions of migration are a challenge for data collection aiming to better understand the causes and consequences of migration. Adaptation assessment requires pre- and post-treatment data, but collecting panel survey data on migration is difficult because migration implies that respondents change their place of residence, making respondent tracking difficult. Only a handful of authors have used panel data in their analysis (Gray and Mueller 2012; Pereira and Caravajal 2008). One alternative involves surveying households about family members who moved to another location (Dillon, Mueller, and Salau 2011). The caveat with this approach, however, is that the results on migration decisions by some members of the household may not generalize to the migration by the entire household. Households that decide to send only one person to a different location may be different from households that migrate together. Furthermore, migration by one or more household members is distinct from migration by the entire household as the latter harder to reverse and requires higher risk tolerance by household members (see Piguet 2010, on alternative methodological approaches). While some studies use macro-level data on international migration (Beine and Parsons 2012; Reuveny and Moore 2009), this is not a panacea since international migration statistics document only cross-border migration and fail to capture movements of people within country.
Despite these challenges, the empirical literature seeking to estimate the effect of changing environment has been growing rapidly. This literature suggests that the relationship between migration and environmental change is nuanced, so that careful attention should be paid to the type of climate or weather event and the type of migration. For example, using a gravity model and census data for the Republic of Yemen, Joseph and Wodon (2013, 2014) find that while climate factors do play a role in migration flows between districts, that role is much smaller than the effect of socioeconomic variables. There is also a growing consensus that migration requires a minimum level of resources, and liquidity constraints impede internal migration by the poorest households leading to an ""immobility paradox"" (Foresight 2011; Gray 2009; Halliday 2006; Hammer 2004; Meze-Hausken 2000) which has gender implications.2
Most micro-level studies measure climate change either by the incidences of extreme weather events or by variation in temperature or rainfall. The evidence is weaker on household responses to incremental environmental degradation such as pollution, soil degradation, or deforestation. Since these factors are incremental, it is harder to isolate their effects on migration from other drivers. Studies by Rappaport and Sachs (2003) and Rappaport (2007) indirectly address the issue of migration as a response to the quality of living by looking at the


weather-related moves in the United States. They suggest that in countries with higher per capita income weather becomes a location amenity that affects choice of residence. Further research, however, is needed on how households in developing countries respond to the quality of environment (Findlay 2011; Findlay and Geddes 2011). Some studies that focus on international migration have also identified environment as a driver. Changes in temperature and rainfall have been found to induce out-migration from rural communities in Mexico to the United States (Andersen, Lund, and Verner 2011; Feng, Kruegera, and Oppenheimer 2010; Munshi 2003). Consistent with the liquidity constraint hypothesis, international migration declines immediately after extreme weather events but internal migration increases because affected households cannot afford long-distance relocation (Beine and Parsons 2012; Findley 1994; Henry and Schoumaker 2004).
A few studies have found that formal and informal institutions as well as policies also affect migration. Institutions that make government more responsive to households (for example through public spending) discourage both international and domestic migration in the aftermath of extreme weather events (Andersen, Lund, and Verner 2011; Paul 2005; Reuveny and Moore 2009). Qualitative studies underscore the importance of informal institutions such as social networks (McLeman and Smit 2006) and intra-household distribution of power (Carr 2005). But migration is often an option of last resort after vulnerable rural populations attempting to cope with new and challenging circumstances have exhausted other options such as eating less, selling assets, or removing children from school. As to remittances, they can be essential for meeting basic food and other needs, especially for households affected by extreme weather events.
Finally, in terms of a broader conceptual framework that can be used for policy discussions, the Foresight (2011) report makes several important conclusions which are worth reiterating here. First, while environmental change will affect migration, the complexity of the interactions at work in decisions made by individuals and households to migrate are such that it is typically not be feasible to identify ""pure"" environmental migrants. Second, even in the absence of climate change and further environmental degradation, migration away from areas that are environmentally vulnerable today will continue. Third, at the same time, the impact of environmental change on migration will tend to increase in the future. Fourth, planning ahead and managing migration flows to the extent that this can be done will help reduce the risk of humanitarian crises. Fifth, and this is often overlooked, environmental change may make it more difficult for some groups to migrate, because of the cost of migration and the fact that weather shocks often reduce the resources available to people in order to migrate. Sixth, as a result of a lack of migration, some population groups may be trapped in vulnerable areas and these groups deserve attention as well. Finally, attempts to prevent or constrain migration are likely to also have their own substantial negative consequences in terms of impoverishment.
Therefore, the policy challenge consists in finding ways to reduce the negative impact of environmental change on communities while also planning
for migration so that it can be ""transformational"" by providing benefits for populations in both sending and receiving areas. In other words, the Foresight report suggests that climate-induced migration may not be just part of the ""problem"" but can also be part of the solution to various development challenges.
There is some emphasis in parts of the Foresight report on the risks faced by cities in low-income countries given that while being already vulnerable, these cities continue to attract migrants. The risks faced by vulnerable cities are very serious indeed. In this study however, the focus is on how vulnerable rural areas are affected today by climate change and weather shocks, on the impact that these changes and shocks have on households, and on the extent to which they are inducing migration away from these areas. Also, while the Foresight report focuses on the big picture at a global level as it emerges from a wide range of studies, some global and some local, some based on household surveys and other based on climatic and geophysical data, the focus in this study is on somewhat narrow and detailed work using household surveys in a few specific areas affected by climate change and weather shocks.
While there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration, the evidence for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of access to survey data. This study is based in large part on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen (Burger et al. 2014a, 2014b). The same household survey was implemented in two climateaffected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context. The survey took approximately two hours to administer and it was designed to elicit household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, self-assessed economic loss, coping strategies such as migration, and awareness of community and government assistance. The surveys were administered by in-country partners to a randomly selected set of 800 households per country. In addition, focus groups and semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted in the five countries among both rural residents and urban migrants. Finally, existing survey and census data from Morocco and the Republic of Yemen were also used.
It is important to highlight some of the limits of the study. It is sometimes said that ""Climate is what we expect. Weather is what we get."" Simply put, climate relates to the distribution of variables such as temperature and rainfall over a period of time, often 30 years at least. This distribution is characterized by its moments, including the mean and the variance of key climatic variables. Climate change is then used to refer to the change in the distribution of rainfall and temperature. However, it is more difficult to tell if the weather experienced at any point in time is due to the change in the climate (the overall mean and variance of rainfall and temperature) or is simply part of an existing distribution. As a result, it should be emphasized that this study does not provide new evidence on the direct relationship between climate change and migration, but it does contribute to the evidence on three specific issues: (1) the impact of weather shocks on migration; (2) the impact of perceptions of recent climate change on migration; and (3) the impact of climate patterns (but not directly climate change) on migration.

Another difficulty relates to the question of whether the observed behavior of households relates to ex-ante or ex-post coping and adaptation. Much of the data obtained through the surveys relate to migration following weather shocks, but this migration may result from an ex post adaptation, or an ex ante adaptation of changes in the climate to come, and this cannot be distinguished easily with the data at hand. In some cases, proactive adaptation may be hurting welfare or productivity as households may for example trade-off lower earnings for less risk. Understanding such behaviors requires a deeper understanding of the impacts of climate change and clarity on the nature and effectiveness of the practices that have been developed historically by households and communities as a result of repeated exposures to weather shocks in the past. Assuming there is agreement that the climate is changing one may then analyze whether the old coping strategies continue to be equally or less effective as in the past. Such an analysis is however beyond the scope of the present report, in part because past data is not available.
Finally, it must be emphasized that the synthesis provided in this chapter is mostly descriptive and meant to highlight stylized facts. More detailed work relying among others on regression analysis is provided in subsequent chapters. It is also important to emphasize that neither the household survey results nor the findings from the qualitative focus groups are meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country. The exception to this rule is for the additional work carried using existing data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen, given that these sources of data were nationally representative (and exhaustive as well in the case of the the Republic of Yemen census). It must also be recognized again that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses. This is especially the case when working with cross-sectional household surveys, given that shorter-term events may be consistent with, but need not necessarily be reflective of longer-term climate change. These caveats being clear, the rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section two discusses household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events. Section three focuses on migration as a coping mechanisms and income diversification strategy. Section four examines other coping and adaptation strategies. Section five discusses perceptions about government and community programs. A brief conclusion follows.

Perceptions about Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events
Do households believe that changes in climate patterns are taking place in the five countries? While perceptions of climate change need not mean that climate change is actually occurring, they are an important entry point in trying to understand how climate events affect household livelihoods and how households respond to such events. As shown in table 1.1 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a), where perceptions about changes in climate have been ranked according to the
share of households sharing these perceptions in the five-country sample, this seems to indeed be the case in the five-country sample based on the new household surveys conducted in 2011. More than three fourths of households in the combined sample declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters say that temperatures are higher. Between half and two thirds of households declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent. The changes in climate in turn appear to lead to more diseases in animal and livestock, more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion.
Some of the extreme weather events often associated with climate change, such as rainstorms and floods, are not perceived as more frequent by a majority
Climate Change and Migration · http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-0-8213-9971-2
of households. In some cases, households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler, and that there is actually more rain, but this is often the case only for a minority of households. Thus, while there are differences between households as well as between countries (for example, households in Egypt are less likely to perceive a reduction in rainfall), overall the patterns are clear. Furthermore, although this is not shown in table 1.1, differences between quintiles of well-being in perceptions of climate change tend to be minor--most households share the same perceptions.
Additional information on perceptions about the climate, weather shocks, and their impact on households is available for Morocco through special modules on climate change and shocks incorporated in a national survey implemented in 2009/10 (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a). In the survey, as shown in table 1.2, 28.1 percent of households were involved in agriculture, and among those 92.1 percent declared having been affected by deteriorating climatic conditions in the last five years. The most likely shock was a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall, mentioned by 62.2 percent of agricultural households. In a separate part of the Morocco survey, more than one in five households declared having been affected by a recent weather shock such as a drought or flood, a proportion similar to the product of the share of households in agriculture and the share of those households affected by changing climatic conditions.
Have households been affected by extreme weather events, and in that case which events had the largest impact? Returning to the five-country sample, when asked if they have been affected by a weather-related disaster in the last five years, almost all households say that this is the case, as shown in table 1.3 from Adoho and Wodon (2014a). When asked which adverse event had the largest negative consequences for them, households cited drought first (30.9 percent of the overall sample), followed by excessive heat and floods, both affecting about 8 percent of households. There are differences between

Among household in agriculture, share affected by climate-related shock Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions Reduction in stock of livestock due to lower availability of grazing land At least one problem in the last five years

countries though. In Syria, all households declare having been affected by droughts, this being the adverse event considered the most damaging. In Morocco by contrast, floods were the main adverse event affecting households. There are also some differences between households according to their quintile of well-being, but these are less pronounced. The quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of data on consumption. What the data suggest is that households in the poorer quintile are more likely to identify adverse events that affected them the most,
probably because they are more vulnerable to such shocks, as discussed in more detailed below.
What has been the effect of climate change on households? Households were asked whether in the last five years they suffered from lost income, lost crops, lost livestock or cattle, or less fish caught as a result of weather and environment patterns. Table 1.4 summarizes the responses. More than half of all respondents said that environmental changes led to a loss of crops, and more than a third reported a loss of income. About a fourth reported a loss of livestock or cattle, and 8.6 percent said that they caught less fish. The results differ again between the countries, with especially high frequencies of losses of crops in Syria (remember that virtually all households in the areas surveyed reported suffering from a drought), and lower frequencies in Egypt. As expected, households belonging to lower quintiles of well-being were more likely than better off households to suffer from the various types of losses.
Again, additional information on the extent to which households are able to cope with weather shocks is available for Morocco through the 2009/10 survey (Nguyen and Wodon 2014a). It turns out that most of the households that were affected declared that they had not been able to recover from the shock, and this was especially the case among poorer households. According to regression analysis, households in the top quintile of wealth were 20 percentage points more likely to recover from weather shocks than households in the bottom quintile.
The substantial impact of climate change and extreme weather events on the livelihood of households also emerged from the qualitative focus groups (Grant et al. 2013). The majority of respondents were aware of long-term shifts in climate and they attributed declining agriculture fortunes to deteriorating environmental conditions that are caused by changing weather patterns. Conditions in rural or ""sending areas"" have become very difficult according to the vast majority

of respondents. In Egypt for example, participants complained of fewer days of rainfall and lower irrigation levels. For key crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results may be devastating: ""Rice is burnt in some seasons, because we cannot find enough water to irrigate it"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia). They also cited government expropriation of agricultural land as an obstacle to profitable and sustainable agriculture (this problem was not mentioned in other countries). Many former rural residents also mentioned the rising costs of seeds and other agricultural inputs, which may be related in part to climatic conditions.
For some farmers, the poor quality and quantity of crops means lower prices for their agricultural products, which reduces income. The inability to earn a stable and adequate income for crops makes it difficult to rely solely on agriculture as a source of revenue. As a focus group participant from the town of Djelfa in Algeria explained: ""The conditions [for] farming are very poor. There's drought on the one hand and the unavailability of the new equipment and poor methods we use on the other hand. Of course, this is the main problem in our life. Our life here depends on the rain, and if there is no rain, how could we survive? ... The impact of poor weather conditions was disastrous to my farm's yields. My income from cereals and vegetables is not enough to feed my household. As I mentioned, the income [has] decreased to its minimum, and I cannot regain the cost of farming over the last two years. All farmers in this region have been affected by the drought and lost their yields"" (Male, 35­45 years old).
In the Republic of Yemen, almost every rural resident from the area of Hudaydah emphasized the problem of warm weather and increasing heat waves. Electricity that allows for cooling functions only two to three hours per day, causing residents to lose sleep during the evening due to excessive heat. Residents therefore sleep during the day because of exhaustion, but with fewer daytime hours dedicated to work and income generation. Agricultural productivity is further weakened by lack of governance and neglect of the sector, ineffective government policies, and corruption. Unfavorable crop prices have led growers to shift from cultivating food crops to qat which is more profitable but requires a great deal of water: ""People there [in villages] work shoulder to shoulder, but the problem lies in agriculture. They have stopped cultivating crops and coffee beans and replaced them with qat, which now [dominates] agricultural lands. ... Tomatoes, now, ... we import them from Syria"" (Male, 30-39 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen).

Migration
Migration is both a coping mechanism to deal with changes in climate or environmental conditions and an income diversification strategy. Migration helps improve the employment and earnings prospects of migrants, and it may also help the family at home through remittances. What is the extent of migration in the sample? Questions are asked as to whether current members of the households (residents) and past members (nonresident) have migrated. For residents, migration can thus be considered as temporary, since the migrant came back,
while for nonresidents, migration is more likely to be permanent, although it may not be.
Data on both types of migration are provided at the level of households in table 1.5 from Adoho and Wodon (2014c). Three in every 10 households (29.9 percent) have migrants, whether residents or nonresidents. Having nonresident migrants is more likely than resident migrants, but this may be because nonresident migrants may include girls who may have left the household to marry. Much of the migration has been observed in the last five years. There are large differences between countries in the likelihood of migration, especially among resident members. Migration rates are highest in Syria and the Republic of Yemen, and lowest in Algeria. While there are differences between quintiles, these do not appear to be systematic, although when looking at the characteristics of individual migrants and especially their places of destinations, some differences emerge (see table 1.5).
Lower migration rates are obtained when restricting migration to the last five years. At the individual level, 7.6 percent of individuals in the sample as a whole have migrated temporarily, and the proportion over the last five years is 6.2 percent. For permanent migration, the rates are 8.0 percent in the sample as a whole and 5.7 percent in the last five years. Looking at the areas of destination of the individuals who migrate, much of the migration is observed over the last five years. Most migration is internal, but the likelihood of migration abroad is high in Egypt, and also in general higher for individuals from higher quintiles, as expected due to the cost of international migration. For both residents and nonresidents, migration to urban areas, and especially to large cities, is more likely than migration to rural areas.


To what extent are households migrating away from climate-affected areas, and is climate itself a key push factor in such migration? This is a complex question for which detailed regression analysis is required. Using the combined five countries survey data set, Adoho and Wodon (2014c) suggest that changing climatic conditions and extreme weather events lead to higher out-migration. The authors estimate first through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) two indices of how households perceive climatic changes and extreme weather events. The first factor captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts. The second factor captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods. Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one. Next, the authors estimate regression models at the level of individuals for the correlates of migration by both household residents (temporary migrants) and nonresidents (permanent migrants). After controlling for other household and individual characteristics, the authors find that worsening climatic conditions, or the perceptions thereof, do lead to a higher probability of migration, both temporary and permanent.
That is, higher values for both MCA factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of resident migration, with the coefficients being statistically significant and the effects of each of the two factors of a similar order of magnitude. The effects for nonresident migration are similar, although statistically significant only for the whole period, as opposed to the last five years. The estimates suggest that a significant deterioration of climatic conditions would lead to an increase of about 1.5 percentage point for both types of migration. Given the overall migration rate, this would represent between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed, and this magnitude is of an order of magnitude similar to that obtained when considering the reasons stated by households for the migration of some of their members.
Additional evidence for Morocco from Nguyen and Wodon (2014b) using the national survey for 2009/10 mentioned earlier suggest that weather shocks increase the likelihood of temporary migration by slightly more than one percentage point, an order of magnitude again similar to that observed in the five country sample. While in the Morocco national survey, the impact of weather shocks on permanent migration is not statistically significant, the impact of structural changes as reduced agricultural yields due to lack of water is. Finally, using a different approach based on combining census and weather station data from the Republic of Yemen, Joseph and Wodon (2014) and Joseph et al. (2014) find that climate variables do affect migration from some districts to other districts, but in a somewhat limited way, with socioeconomic and cost factors playing a much more prominent role. This analysis, which is based on past data, suggests that migration flows are unlikely to increase sharply in the near term, but if conditions were to change drastically, the effect of weather variables on migration could of course become larger.
The focus groups also suggest a link between climate and migration, although again the role of socioeconomic factors in determining migration is probably at
least as important (Grant et al. 2014). On the climate specifically, many respondents said that they migrated from their rural homes in the countryside because of chronic droughts which lead to declining agricultural productivity: ""There is lack of water has resulted in a failure to be able to cultivate rice and it is an important crop"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). On the other hand, few mentioned flooding or being displaced as a result of natural disasters as a reason for relocation. Married urban female migrants recall having to increase their workload prior to migrating to cities. One woman who resettled in Cairo explained that women in her village have to help their husbands because it has become too expensive to hire cheap agricultural workers: ""We used to help our husbands during harvest collection instead of getting people to do this against a sum of money. Life was difficult there [in the village], so we decided to come here to Cairo as it is more comfortable"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt). Yet the factors leading to a difficulty to make ends meet in rural areas tend to be broader than climate itself, although it is difficult with the qualitative data to assess exactly what part of migration may be related directly to the changes in the climate.
Respondents appear to choose migration only after other strategies have proven unsuccessful. Most migrants describe a precarious life and hardship in the countryside, such as lacking food, water, and income for basic needs, education, and perhaps most importantly, jobs. In many households, male family members had to leave school in order to work, and families had to eat less and forego at least one meal per day. Selling assets to secure income was also a common strategy: ""My father sold mattresses, furniture, and our bed covers. We even sold our last cow during sacrifice. We had nothing"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco); ""My father was a farmer and he could not work anymore. There was no rain, only drought and labor was soon replaced by machines. For example, my mother used to earn income milking cows. She was replaced by machines"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
For older Algerian migrants however, the decision to migrate was driven primarily by violence wrought by the civil war which ravaged Algeria from 1992 to 1999. ""I left my village for two reasons. First, because of the aggravation of terrorism in Djedjel, and second, the weather conditions. The terrorists used to threaten our lives, unless we gave them food and assistance. The drought also gave us poor crops and therefore we had no income, so I decided to leave. In fact, I was working in Libya and when I came back home I found the security situation in my village was very dangerous. The terrorists [were] threatening our lives if we do not accept their ideologies, therefore I decided to relocate in Algiers and did not try to do anything there just removed my family from there"" (Male, 35­50 years old, Algiers, Algeria).
What happens to the migrants once they leave? While the information available in the five surveys is very limited in this area, focus groups were implemented in urban areas to get a feel for the conditions of migrants at their place of destination. A critical step in the integration process for migrants is finding employment. Most rural migrants say they came to urban areas in search of
better job opportunities, either to support their parents' household or to improve future prospects for themselves and their own family. Many men hope to work and save enough to own their own business (a small store or shop). Finding jobs, however, is not an easy feat amid widespread joblessness found throughout the region given that unemployment levels hover around 15 percent, and a much higher 20­40 percent among youth 15­30 years old.
The types of jobs found among migrants in cities are diverse. They include housecleaning (women only), seamstress (women only), waiter, mason, doorman, gardener, baker, selling vegetables, fruits, crafts, factory worker, small shopkeeper, janitor, car parker/attendant, and driver among others. The integration process for rural migrants is also diverse. While some migrants find that urban communities are receptive to their arrival from the countryside, others say they were met with hostility. This sentiment was especially prevalent among Moroccan and Syrian focus group participants who complained of negative stereotyping and discrimination, particularly when trying to find viable employment. ""They look at us and call us `Berber countrymen'. They think we are invaders"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
Some rural migrants said that they felt disadvantaged vis-à-vis urban dwellers because they lacked what is needed to secure proper employment, especially a degree and French-and Arabic-speaking capability, both of which tend to be needed even for jobs requiring minimal skills. ""When I go look for a job, they ask for a degree and French--this is for hairdressing, sewing or couture"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca). Syrian rural migrants, likewise, said that they feel inferior and unwelcome in large cities like Damascus. Wherever they go, they are treated like strangers and ""different."" This perception makes finding a good job difficult. For the Republic of Yemenis, the main obstacle to finding a job may be corruption, which is deep and pervasive. Corruption was also mentioned by the Republic of Yemenis as a major problem in general, and more so than in other countries. Put simply: ""You need to bribe your way into a position. That is your easy way towards a good job position--and we all love the easy way"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa).
For virtually all focus group participants, finding adequate housing was also a challenge. Urbanization has caused a shortage of housing in many cities, with resulting housing conditions for immigrants being suboptimal. Overcrowded dwellings in poor conditions tend to be the norm for new migrants. ""I'm 39, married, with five kids and I don't have a flat of my own. I pay 300 Egyptian pounds per month and cannot have a flat. Why don't they grant me one? They say you have to rent for just one year, and then it all depends on the owner"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). ""We live on top of each other. There's no privacy. Sometimes you get your money stolen"" (Male, 18­25 Casablanca, Morocco). Algerian rural migrants often live in slums. ""The condition of my house or slum is very bad. In winter the rain comes through the ceiling, and it is very cold, (no central heating) and in the summer it is very hot because I have no air conditioning. To be honest my slum is not even suitable to house animals"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Algiers, Algeria). For the Republic of Yemenis, corruption is a problem
for housing as well. As a resident of Sanaa building a house explained it: ""The house is owned but the problem is that you either build or take a random permit. Permits cost up to 60 thousand riyals of which 20­30 thousand are bribes. And paper-work takes two to three weeks, and if we don't pay the bribe they would complicate and even create problems because the Yemeni people have become accustomed to bribery. One loses the sense of this duty due to the fact that his job is underpaid and he does not consider taking another one since he allots his afternoons to qat consumption"" (Males, 35­45).
Preexisting migrant communities make certain areas more attractive than others for migrants. Established communities that share potential migrants' lineage, tribe, or ethnic background ease the transition. Many focus group respondents spoke of relying on relatives or family friends as an intermediary for finding a job and a place to live. These individuals have resided in cities for a long time and have established networks that are critical for information gathering, and thus for reducing the risks and uncertainty associated with migration. A young Egyptian migrant attributed his success in finding a job quickly to a cousin with connections in the medical community. Another who did not enjoy the same advantage said: ""I had no family relations--and it took me a whole year to get a job"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt).
Networks also ease feelings of isolation that are common among migrants. Participants mentioned that they now have only limited interactions with their neighbors, if they are fortunate to know them at all. In the words of one Egyptian woman: ""Neighbors are close in the villages. Here [in Cairo], I don't know my neighbors, what their job is or how they live"" (Female, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). They also lamented the shift of emphasis away from family and traditions. Crime and harassment were also mentioned, with Moroccan focus groups suggesting that female migrants are more at risk than men. ""We are always subject to problems in the street. Men harass us and they say bad words. We fell like strangers here. When they know we are strangers, they treat us worst"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
Yet while life in the city is more ""chaotic,"" it is also exciting and full of opportunity. In Morocco migration appeared to widen the options available to young immigrants. First, some young respondents expressed a greater sense of independence, belonging, and self-actualization. A married man celebrated his new life, which no longer includes working with eight brothers in the countryside. Another said that a friend returned to their village dressed in a suit and he immediately wanted to be like him. While relocating to urban areas is a challenge, it is also a chance to realize one's potential. ""I want to have a secure job, to be able travel, be able to see other places, other people. ...to live my life!"" (Male, 20­25, Casablanca, Morocco). This view was however unique in Morocco, and was not found in Algeria, the Republic of Yemen, Syria or Egypt.
Among young Moroccan women, moving to the city is emancipating. Some noticed that since they migrated, they have little desire to get married and have children right away. At least one said that she escaped a life of near-servitude. Another young woman explained that she left her rural home in Azilal to escape
an arranged marriage. Compared to rural life, work in the city offers more autonomy for women. ""I could work, get married, have babies and have a husband who will beat me up. Marriage age in my [rural] area is 18 to 19 years old. I've worked like a slave in others' homes. No more. I wanted to come to Casablanca to live, work and maybe get married"" (Female, 20­25 years old Casablanca, Morocco). Older male participants were more likely to seek marriage and a home for a future family as marriage is seen as a source of stability. However, due to lack of steady income, marriage for most young male respondents is elusive.
Returning home once in a while is important. About a fifth of male respondents said that they do return to their village during holidays and specials occasions, about two to three times per year. But few return to help cultivate the land still held by their family or to live part time with their families. This is in part because it costs money to travel and also maintain housing in the city. ""I worked for a month or two and kept going back to my village in between. But I wasn't able to save money this way. So, I searched for a place so I could have my family with me and it took me a whole year until I found a suitable room"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt).
To conclude this review of the qualitative findings on migration at the place of destination, acquiring sustainable employment is often more difficult than respondents thought it would be, particularly for women. Some expected to find a job much sooner than they had. Others, more broadly, expected a more stable and social lifestyle. Many have had a difficult time making friends in the city and overcoming stereotypes. Long work schedules also are obstacles to making friends. Importantly, all would like in the future to have a better education.
Table 1.6 summarizes in a very stylized way the main results from the analysis of migration. The evidence suggests that worsening climatic conditions, or the perceptions thereof, are clearly a push factor leading to migration away from the affected (mostly rural) areas toward urban centers. It must be noted that in an analysis such as that of Joseph and Wodon (2013a) or Joseph et al. (2013a) which is at the level of a country as a whole, the impact of the climate on the
overall patterns of migration tends to be diluted, which helps explain why the effect is qualified as smaller in table 1.6. By contrast, in the analysis based on the five countries sample, as well as when looking at weather shocks with the national Morocco survey, the effects are estimated mostly on those affected by these shocks, which also explains why the impacts are larger in affected areas. In those areas, it seems fair to suggest that climatic conditions account for at least 10­20 percent of the current migration flows, and this could increase in the future.

Remittances
Although remittances are not the focus of this study, the last part of the study includes two chapters looking at remittances in the case of the Republic of Yemen. There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms. It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks. The first chapter in the last part of the study by Joseph et al. (2014a) use a national household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received. The question is whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances. The results suggest that this is not the case in the Republic of Yemen.
In the last chapter of the study, Joseph and Wodon (2014b) use matching techniques and the same household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition). The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate. Four main results are obtained. First, remittances--which are substantial in the Republic of Yemen-- tend to have positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition. Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances. Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable. Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment. Thus, in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and
malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances may be used more for investments, including in the education of children.
The qualitative work (Grant et al. 2014) also suggests that remittances are important to rural households, especially in rural the Republic of Yemen where there is a long-standing tradition of migration to Saudi Arabia. They allow households to enjoy a reasonably high standard of living, but conversely consequences can be severed in their absence: ""My brother is in Saudi Arabia. He used to send me money all of the time and we were well off, even when I wasn't working. [But] we lost the house and everything we [owned] because of the discontinuity of these aids. We live at God's mercy"" (Male, 30­45 years old, Hudaydah, the Republic of Yemen). By contrast, participants in focus groups from Morocco and Algeria did not depend on remittances as much, with only a few saying that they receive remittances from relatives. Similarly some Algerian rural residents received remittances from relatives who have migrated to France. In Egypt, items such as ghee, oil, bread, flour, and sugar are purchased for families in addition to funds being sent directly to homes. The amounts of the transfers sent by migrants back home vary. In Morocco remittances ranged from 500 to 1,000 Moroccan dirham per month, depending on the migrant's income. Male respondents tended to remit more than females. For most, providing remittances for their family was a moral obligation. ""They [our families] are in a terrible situation. Sometimes they call us to send money each month. Sometimes, I go without dinner or not spend much needed money on myself so I can send money to my family. Without money, they cannot eat. They would have no money for the souk to get food to eat"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
Though urban residents in Algeria, Morocco, Syria, and Egypt overwhelmingly report sending remittances back home, the Republic of Yemeni urban respondents by contrast were more likely to receive remittances from family members working abroad, especially from Saudi Arabia. These remittances were critical to household survival. ""We do not rely on jobs. My mother is a government employee she gets paid 60 thousand riyals which does not cover expenses for seven days, but we rely on the income that comes from the my father who works abroad in Saudi Arabia"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen). ""My brothers work in Saudi Arabia to provide good living for themselves and their families here in Yemen. They send me money when I need it because my work is not enough for me and my family. ...wages in Saudi Arabia are good and he works one job which is sufficient for him and his family living in Yemen. We rely upon them a great deal. Employment outside Yemen is available in addition to the currency difference. If the surplus is sent to us, it is better than a month's salary here. If it weren't for them we would have nothing to eat"" (Male, 25­30 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen).

Other Coping and Adaptation Strategies Apart from migration, what are some of the other coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with difficulties to sustain their livelihood and
shocks, including those brought about by climate? Table 1.7 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b) provides information from the surveys on how households have dealt, or might deal, with shocks. Specifically, households who were affected by climate and environmental patterns and who lost income, crops, or livestock and cattle, or who caught less fish, were asked whether they used one of several coping mechanism, and if not, whether they would be likely to use such a coping mechanism if they were affected by climate patterns in the future. If the households answered yes to the question on whether they did use the coping mechanism, or if they agreed strongly or somewhat with the fact that they might use this coping mechanism in the future, they are considered as using the mechanism in table 1.6. In the table, the share of those using the various mechanisms as a proportion of the total population is provided (this factors in those not affected by shocks that are considered as not using the mechanism).
Some 60.6 percent of households declare that they have used or would use their savings in case of a climate shock. This is followed by 46.8 percent of respondents (household heads) who have sold or would sell their assets, 46.2 percent who have asked for a loan or would do so, 40.6 percent who have sold or

would sell their livestock, and finally 36.4 percent who have withdrawn or would withdraw their children from school. The proportions of households resorting to these various strategies tend to be higher among lower quintiles (which have fewer other ways to cope), and they are also higher among households declaring that they lost income, crops, or livestock/cattle, or caught less fish, as expected. There are differences between countries, especially regarding the possibility of withdrawing children from school--in Egypt this is not considered by most households. Also, households receiving international remittances, who tend to be better off, are less likely to resort to coping strategies, except using their savings.
The qualitative focus groups also reveal many different types of coping and adaptation strategies used by households, including selling assets, shifting food consumption habits (such as eating less chicken or beef or eating one less meal), and even removing children from school in order for them to work and support the household (Grant et al. 2014). Borrowing food or money from the community is also common in times of economic stress. Women, in particular, are mindful of loss of income on the ability to help their children get married. ""It affects everything. My husband passed away and my monthly income is 60 or 90 EGP, i.e. nothing. Sometimes I refuse a suitor of my daughter because I cannot afford getting her married"" (Female, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). Another key coping strategy is to diversify income sources. One Egyptian woman explained that poor prices turn farmers away from agriculture altogether: ""[Farmers] used to exert earnest effort in the past because the gains were equally profitable, but now it is of no use. Land [requires] a lot of money and the earnings then have to be distributed among many in the family"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt). Or as a Syrian man explained it: ""When the al-Kabour river was flowing, there was a labor force here and people were able to cultivate their lands, but now..."" (Male, 25­45 years old, al-Hasaka, Syria). Yet traveling long distances between homes and jobs is cumbersome--and expensive, with a number of respondents in all five countries expressing frustration about the expense of transportation and lack of good roads.
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes. The possibilities included changing production technologies such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; changing crop choices, increasing crop variety, or adopting drought or flood-resistant crops; changing the percentage composition of crops versus livestock; increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides; seeking or increasing off-farm employment; and receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment. Households were also asked whether compared to five years ago they used more stored water or consumed more stored grains and stored animal products. They were asked whether they were aware of people moving out of their community as a result of weather or environmental changes, and whether in the last five years people moved into their community. Finally, they were asked if in the past five years they experienced conflict over agricultural land or livestock, or water for household use or cultivation due to weather or environmental changes.
The results for those questions are provided in table 1.8 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b). For the sample as a whole, and for most of the alternatives presented in the questionnaire, only a minority of households have implemented any single one of the adaptation strategies. This is explained in part by the fact that many of the alternatives apply mostly to farming households, and not all households are involved in farming (this is evident in the fact that the proportion of households using the various adaptation strategies are higher among households who own land, many of whom farm their land). Between one in four and one in five households have relied more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought off-farm work, have used more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made a change in their farm production technology. The proportion of those who have received training or changed their crop mix or the varieties they use is at about 15 percent. Only 9 percent of households have changed their mix of crops and livestock for their livelihood.
On the other hand, more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of their community due to the climate pressures, and 14 percent declare that some people have moved in, which may at time generate conflict over water, land, or livestock. There are some large differences between countries in the use of adaptation strategies, with households in Egypt and Syria making fewer changes in their modes of livelihood than households in Algeria, the Republic of Yemen, and to some extent Morocco. It also appears that households in the bottom quintiles, which tend to be affected by climate change the most and have limited means to cope with weather shocks and changing conditions, also have made more changes in their livelihood strategies. But this may also be in part because a larger share of those households is involved in farming. As before households with international remittances who tend to also be better off tend to rely less on those adaptation strategies than other households.
In the absence of local organizations or government agencies that provide assistance (as discussed in the next section), residents tend to rely on each other to cope. As a rural Egyptian male explains it in the focus groups: ""Rural residents are willing to pay [give] half of what we have to help others. If I have 10 pounds [Egyptian pounds], I will pay 5. If I have 100 pounds, I will pay 50. This is how the social norms work here. We are all one family"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). Yet solidarity does not always work, and conflicts over natural resources do occur due to changes in climate, as the estimates in table 1.7 show. In the Republic of Yemen in particular, rural residents worried in the focus groups that water scarcity has led to conflict over access to wells. One the Republic of Yemeni woman from Hudaydah described a complicated water distribution scheme where water is distributed to certain communities on certain days of the week. More generally, for farmers in all five countries, living in impoverished rural areas is not only difficult financially, but it also has negative impacts for health, a concern mentioned by Egyptian rural focus group respondents. Some point out that farmers are increasingly exposed to contaminated water because waste leaks into irrigation canals. Others mention being sick with illnesses such as the flu. With only limited income at their disposal, many
households cannot afford quality health care and they also often cannot access health facilities because they are not in close proximity.

Community and Government Programs
In previous sections, information was provided about strategies used by households to cope with weather or environmental changes. What about the role of communities and governments? The survey questionnaire asked whether to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which the household live did the following: planting trees or installing soil protection measures; building banks on rivers, streams or small check banks to reduce flooding; developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation or roads; gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income or livestock; taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts; and taking action to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment.
Table 1.9 from Adoho and Wodon (2014b) provides the results of the analysis. To a large extent, the extent of community involvement to adapt to climate change is limited. While 1 in 5 households declares that the community has planted trees or taken soil erosion measures, and 1 in7 households mentioned


community measures to purchase seeds, animals, or farm equipment, the other actions that could be taken by communities are mentioned by only 1 in 10 households on average. There are large differences between countries, with households in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen much more likely to mention community initiatives than households in the other three countries. Households in the bottom quintiles (as well as those owning land, although this is not shown in the table) are also more likely to mention initiatives, perhaps because they are more aware of these initiatives as they tend to be affected by weather shocks more. Still, many communities do not seem to implement the types of measures that might help households to cope and adapt.
Similar questions were asked about the role of governments, albeit with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low. The results are provided in table 1.10. Except for the provision of drinking water which is less related to climate change and shocks, the extent of government involvement in adaptation strategies or safety nets is also limited. For most types of programs, only about 1 in 10 households declare that the government has been active. There are again differences between countries, with households in Algeria, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen more likely to mention government programs than households in Egypt and Morocco. In many but not in all cases households in the bottom three quintiles are more likely to mention initiatives, as was the case for community programs. Overall, the extent of government support appears to be limited.
The fact that community and government programs to help households cope with weather shocks are the exception rather than the rule was also a conclusion of the qualitative work. When asked about government and community programs, focus group respondents said that they were aware of few programs and organizations geared toward assisting the rural poor affected by climate change. Some the Republic of Yemeni residents mentioned the Saleh Organization, but concluded that it only provides temporary help or relief. Rural Algerians knew about government assistance for the agricultural sector, including low interest loans and government extension workers travelling to villages to advise farmers on growing methods. Yet they suggested that the impact of these services was uneven, that isolated locales were far from their reach, and that bureaucracy and corruption made loan acquisition from formal institutions such as banks a lengthy and frustrating process, so much so that most farmers avoid this option altogether.
In the focus groups, rural participants suggested a number of areas where government initiatives could help farmers better adapt to their changing environment (Grant et al. 2014). Egyptian respondents mentioned the importance of strengthening agricultural unions. In one focus group, rural participants recalled that in the past these unions were stronger and benefitted from linkages

to the Egyptian parliament, so that they were in a much better position to serve agricultural interests. Government provision of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers was also suggested in addition to the provision of loans to purchase machinery or for livestock breeding. ""We need machinery that would help us collect rice ashes instead of burning it and to press wood automatically. Livestock breeding ... are also projects that are of low cost to the government""
(Male 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). However, participants were not convinced that real change would materialize due to pervasive patronage constraining progress in the countryside. Syrians in al-Hasakeh recommended removing the dam at the al-Kabhour river to allow greater access to water, in addition to encouraging the government to keep its promises to improve rural infrastructure. Assistance with navigating the process to obtain loans was also suggested.
Job training and improved employment opportunities for both rural men and women were also mentioned as helpful. Men and women said that although local norms may frown upon women working, particularly in public spaces typically reserved for men, training for employment that is discreet and suitable in or near the home would be welcome. Moroccan participants, though, were virtually unanimous in their objection to rural women working in positions deemed unacceptable according to community norms (such as sales and teaching). Some the Republic of Yemenis were doubtful that any government program would bear fruit, citing corruption and distrust of the Republic of Yemeni institutions as the reason for their lack of confidence.
In urban areas, access to health care, education and job training, credit for housing and rental assistance were all seen as vital for advancing the integration of rural migrants into urban communities. Some suggestions were country specific. In Morocco respondents complained of not having the appropriate official documents that enable them to work and receive credit: ""Our life is in crisis. When you don't have official documents, what else can you do?"" (Male, 35­45 years old, Casablanca, Morocco). French-speaking capability was also mentioned in Morocco for being able to fully function in the labor force, with suggestions for government-funded language training (this was not suggested in the other countries). By contrast, Egyptians emphasized the need for government assistance with agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as no-interest loans and credit. In the Republic of Yemen, as was the case for rural residents, the respondents' faith in their domestic institutions was low: ""I heard about [various programs] and [people] did not get their help because those responsible for these institutions are taking the money which they promise to help the citizen with. Also, with institutions of disabled people we hear that they are funded with millions, but the money is being divided in between government officials. The disabled person is supposed to receive a monthly salary receives 3000 riyals every three months, and the 1000 riyals doesn't even suffice him for a day, and all the equipment is ancient. So where is the money going?"" (Male, 25­30 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen). It is also worth noting that focus groups participants from all countries did not look to mosques for solace or assistance, and respondents were united in their reprehension toward using children to peddle.

Conclusion The goal of the study was to contribute to a better understanding of perceptions of climate change, environmental degradation, and extreme weather events and their relationship to migration and other coping strategies in the MENA region.
Quantitative and qualitative data collection activities were implemented in climate-affected areas in five countries, and existing census and survey data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen were used as well. The analysis suggests that a majority of households do perceive important changes in the climate, such as more erratic rain, higher temperatures, less rain, dryer and less fertile land, and more frequent droughts.
These changes have led to a range of negative consequences for agriculture and livestock production, and extreme weather events have been associated with losses in incomes, crops, and livestock. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse, including migration, selling various assets, and taking other emergency measures to get by, as well as changing the household's sources of livelihoods in terms of crops, livestock production, and off-farm work among others. Yet many households do not appear to use these strategies, and in addition the extent to which they benefit from community and government programs and initiatives to help them cope with weather or environmental changes is limited.
In terms of migration, the study suggests that the impact of weather shocks and deteriorating conditions on migration is positive, leading to higher temporary and permanent migration. In the areas most affected by climate change, the analysis suggests that climatic factors may account for between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed today, but this is likely to increase as climate conditions continue to deteriorate. Furthermore, while many migrants appreciate the opportunities that migration offer, their living conditions and their ability to be well integrated in their areas of destination is far from being guaranteed, especially given intense competition for relatively few good job opportunities.
PART 2
Focus Countries and Data

CHAPTER 2
Focus Countries
Nicholas Burger, Audra Grant, Sarah Kups, Yashodhara Rana, and Quentin Wodon

This study aims to be relevant for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region as a whole, but it focuses on five countries--Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Yemen, and in many (but not all) cases on specific geographic areas within each of the five countries. After a brief introduction, this chapter outlines the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries. Next, to provide contextual background for the study, the chapter provides an introductory discussion of climate and migration patterns in each of the five countries, and of the policy and institutional context in which discussions on climate change take place.

Introduction

This study is about the impact of climate change on households, their coping mechanisms and their adaptation strategies, and especially migration. Migration decisions are influenced by a wide range of considerations related to climate change, including the risks of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts and the destruction they may cause, as well as the indirect effects of these and other events, such as lower agricultural yields, lack of water, and the health effects of excess temperatures. Understanding how climate change may impact migration is important to inform not only government and other programs to help households cope with and adapt to climate change but also a wide range of investment decisions which must anticipate future patterns of mobility and settlements. Yet to-date relatively little is known about the extent to which households are affected by climate change in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and whether climate change and extreme weather events have a large impact on migration decisions.
While this study aims to be relevant for the MENA region as a whole, it focuses on five countries--Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen. In that context, the objective of this chapter is twofold. First, the chapter lays out the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries. The aim was to select countries which (1) had a large population to ensure that findings from the study to be illustrative (but not representative) of the relationships
between climate change and migration for a large share of the MENA population; (2) were affected by changes in weather patterns and the environment, especially in terms of the frequency of droughts; (3) represented a wide array of socioeconomic contexts in terms of the countries' levels of development, but with an emphasis on some of the poorer countries where the impact of climate change on households may be largest; (4) had other available data sources such as other household surveys or census data which could be used for complementary analysis.1
Second, the chapter provides contextual background information on each of the five countries selected for the study. Information is provided first on traditional patterns of international and domestic migration in each country, and next on some of the challenges that the country is facing regarding climate change as well as the institutional framework in which policies related to climate change are being considered, and some of the programs and policies that have been adopted by the government as well as by nongovernmental actors in this area.
The structure of the chapter is as follows. Section two outlines the reasons that led to the choice of the five focus countries. The next five sections provide contextual background for the study on each of the five focus countries. A brief conclusion follows.

Criteria for the Choice of Focus Countries
As mentioned in the introduction, four criteria guided the choice of the focus countries in which new data were collected. This section explains and reviews each of these four criteria.
Consider first population size. Table 2.1 provides population data for the top 10 Arab countries by population size as of July 2012 according to UN estimates, as well as other variables such as population growth. Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco are the three most populated countries in the region, and are part of our sample
of focus countries. The Republic of Yemen and Syria rank seventh and eighth on the list. We did not choose Iraq because of the ongoing tensions within the country. Sudan was not selected because administratively, it belongs to the SubSaharan Africa region of the World Bank, and not to the Middle East and North Africa Region. Saudi Arabia was not considered because it is much wealthier (and less agrarian) than the other countries, and thereby has much more resources at its disposal to cope with and adapt to climate change. The Islamic Republic of Iran is not listed in table 2.1 because it is usually not considered as an Arab country.2
Consider next vulnerability to climate change. As will be clear in subsequent chapters, while some households in the areas of focus of the study have been or are likely to be affected by floods, many more are affected by droughts. Without downplaying the threat of floods, the population affected by droughts is much larger. An analysis of vulnerability to droughts with a special focus on Syria, but with comparative data for other MENA countries was recently conducted by the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands and the United Nations Secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Regional Office for Arab States (ACSAD and ISDR 2011). On the basis of data on drought frequency and consecutive droughts, the authors estimate that 69.1 percent of the area of the Arab region is not vulnerable to droughts, 14.45 percent has a low level of vulnerability, 10.98 percent is moderately vulnerable and 5.47 percent is highly vulnerable.
As shown in table 2.2, some of the countries most vulnerable to droughts are Syria (especially the north eastern area), Sudan (southern area), Tunisia (northern area), Algeria (northern area), Morocco (northern area), Somalia (north eastern area), Iraq (north eastern area), Saudi Arabia (north eastern area), and the Republic of Yemen. The focus countries were chosen in part in order to represent conditions in different parts of the region, with Algeria and Morocco being part of the Maghreb, Egypt belonging to the Central Region, Syria located in the Mashreq and the Republic of Yemen located in the Arabian Peninsula. Four of the five countries are among the most vulnerable to droughts in the region, and Egypt was chosen as the largest country in the Central Region and more generally in the Arab world, as discussed earlier. The ACSAD-ISDR study also emphasizes the fact that the drought vulnerable areas tend to be highly populated, with an estimated 54.69 million people living in areas under high stress from drought vulnerability, and another 91.3 million in areas moderately vulnerable to droughts.
Consider third levels of socioeconomic development. The principle guiding the choice of countries was to focus on middle- and low-income countries, because these countries tend to have fewer means at their disposal than highincome countries to be able to cope with and adapt to climate change (higherincome countries are also of course affected by climate change, and often in dramatic ways, but their resources make it easier to protect the population from some of the damaging effects of extreme weather shocks). Also, middle- and lowincome countries are more likely than high-income countries to have net emigration flows internationally.
Our five focus countries include four middle-income countries--Algeria (with a per capita GDP of US$7,643 in 2011 in US$3), Egypt (per capita GDP US$5,547 in 2011), Syria (per capita GDP of US$4,741 in 2010), and Morocco (per capita GDP of US$4,373 in 2011), but they also include a much poorer country--the Republic of Yemen, with a per capita GDP of only US$2,060 in 2011 (all figures are from the World Bank's World Development Indicators). Differences in standards of living can also be illustrated through the under-five mortality rate in the various countries. The lowest rate is for Syria, at 15.3 per 1,000 live births, followed by Egypt (21.1 per 1,000 live births), Morocco (35.5 per 1,000 live births), and Algeria (36 per 1,000 live births). The rate is much higher in the Republic of Yemen, at 76.5 per 1,000 live births.
Consider finally the availability of other data sources. Much of the work conducted for this study is based on data newly collected, but where feasible we also relied on existing data. Two of the five countries presented an opportunity of using existing data. First, Morocco had just implemented a national Household
and Youth Survey between December 2009 and March 2010. The survey included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks. Fortunately, just before the survey went to the field, we were able to add a few questions to guide the analysis of climate change and migration. Second, we had at our disposal the latest census and the latest national integrated household survey for the Republic of Yemen. These national datasets for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen made it feasible to conduct analysis for the countries as a whole, thereby complementing the analysis of specific areas within the five countries on the basis of the data collected specifically for this study.
Overall, the combination of these four considerations together with information on the ongoing dialogue between the World Bank, the Agence Française de Développement, and the various country governments, led to the choice of these five specific countries for the study. In what follows, we provide an introductory discussion of climate change and migration in each of the countries.

Algerian Context
As mentioned in the introduction, this section and the four sections that follow provide a brief discussion of migration and climate related topics in each of the five countries of focus. Starting with Algeria, consider first international migration. France has long been the primary external destination for Algerian emigrants. This continued to be true throughout the 1954­62 War of Independence, and after the war, over 1 million Algerians who had fought on the French side moved to France. In 1973, the Algerian government formally suspended migration to France. The government viewed migration as a form of postcolonial dependence and anticipated sufficient labor demand from the petroleum sector (de Haas 2007). Under this policy, mass labor migration was terminated but family reunification migration continued. Over the last decade, more Algerians, in particular highly skilled individuals, have moved to a more diverse set of destination countries, in particular to Spain (Di Bartolomeo, Jaulin, and Perrin 2010). In 2002, it was estimated that 1.3 million individuals (4.2 percent of the population) were living outside of the country. Approximately 85 percent of these emigrants were living in France and an additional 8 percent in other European Union countries. By 2008, the number of emigrants has fallen to below 900,000 however. Since emigration flows increased over the same time period, this seems to imply that many Algerians chose to return to their home country.
Algeria has also become a destination for immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa (Sekkai 2008), and special immigrant groups, such as Chinese workers working for Chinese companies (Temlali 2010). Overall, there were around 100,000 foreigners living legally in the country in 2008 and probably three times as many illegal immigrants and refugees, most of them Sahrawis who fled from West Sahara in 1975 and 1976. Probably around 40 percent of foreign migrants see Algeria as their final destination, another 40 percent see it as a transit station on their way to Europe, and the remainder are refugees or immigrants who would
like to return to their home country but currently don't have the means to do so (Temlali 2010).
Internal migration within Algeria takes place primarily between rural areas and midsized towns, rather than toward large urban areas (Gubert and Nordman 2009). In 2010, 66 percent of the population was living in urban areas, up from 60 percent in 2000. Urban areas have been growing at around 2.5 percent over that period, while the number of people living in rural areas has been declining (World Bank 2011). In addition to voluntary moves, during the Algerian Civil War from 1992 to 2002, at least 1 million Algerians were forced to move within the country. Many of these refugees have not yet been able to return home (EACH-FOR 2008).
As in other countries, unemployment is a key driver of migration flows, including for the case of highly skilled individuals (de Haas 2007; Di Bartolomeo, Jaulin, and Perrin 2010). Although unemployment declined from 29.3 percent in 1999 to 10.2 percent in 2009, rates among under-30-year-olds are typically twice as high as the national and even higher among young highly educated individuals (Ministry of Territorial Management and Environment [MATE] 2010). It is worth noting, however, that unemployment is on average higher among Algerianborn individuals residing abroad than in Algeria itself (European Commission 2010).
Consider next the question of environmental degradation and climate change. The Algerian territory encompasses three main geographic regions: the Tell in the north, the high planes in the center, and the Sahara in the South of the country. The littoral region of the north is the most densely populated, with 63 percent of the population on four percent of the territory. One tenth of the population lives in the Sahara, which represents 85 percent of the territory. The majority of arable land (3 percent of the territory) as well as the majority of industry are located in the coastal region, while the region of the High Plains dominated by semi-nomadic pastoral cultures. The coast and the Tellian Atlas are in a temperate climate zone, with warm summers and mild and rainy winters; the High Plaines and the Saharian Atlas have an arid climate, with low and irregular rainfall, cold winters, and very hot summers; and the Sahara has a desert climate (MATE 2010). Slow-onset environmental degradation is an issue throughout Algeria and the country is already subjected to water stress. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 800 to 1,000 millimeters in the East of the Tellian Atlas to 20­150 millimeters in the Sahara. Since 1975, precipitation has gradually decreased, with currently only 600 cubic meters of fresh water per habitant and year, a level below the U.N. defined scarcity threshold of 1,000 cubic meters (MATE 2010). Based on Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data and World Population Prospects data, Fargues (2008) estimates that this amount will not drastically decrease until 2030, but it may decline after that.
Apart from water scarcity, another environmental problem affecting Algerian agriculture is soil erosion and desertification. In the Algerian steppes 3.5 percent of the land is already subject to desertification or being irreparably damaged, and more than 50 percent of the territory is either highly sensitive or sensitive to

desertification (MATE 2010). For the future, Cline (2007) estimates shortfalls in agricultural yields by 2080 ranging between 28 percent and 36 percent versus the baseline of 2003, while Rousset and Arrus (2006, cited in Gubert and Nordman 2009) predict that by 2020, agricultural yields could decrease from 5 percent to 14 percent as a result of environmental problems exacerbated by climate change.
Extreme climate events are also frequent, with parts of the northern region of the country highly vulnerable to droughts (such as the several-year long drought of the early 1990s), cold waves (January 2005), flash floods (possibly associated with mud slides) due to heavy rainfall (in November 2001, October 2002, and October 2008), and heat waves (summer 2003). The consequences of these events range from large harvest losses and destruction of homes to deaths. For instance, in November 2001 the municipality of Bal El Oud in the region of Algier registered a rainfall of 290 millimeters, 40 percent of the mean annual precipitation, in less than 17 hours. In the wake of this event, in this municipality alone, 712 people died, 115 had disappeared, 311 were injured, and 1,454 families lost their home. Since 1975, both droughts and flooding have become more common, and there are concerns that this trend will continue in the future (MATE 2010). On the other hand, forest fires, which are only partly a result from the climate, have become less common and severe since 2001, due in part to increased surveillance and the implementation of an early warning and intervention system (MATE 2010). Despite being predicted to have the highest rise in sea levels in North Africa by 2030 (NIC 2009) less than 1 percent of the population may be affected by sea level rises (Sowers and Weinthal 2010).
Consider finally the link between environmental degradation, climate change, and migration. To our knowledge, no studies are available on how past environmental shocks have affected migratory movements in Algeria, or how they may be related in the future. A conference hosted by the National Intelligence Council concluded that Algeria is less economically vulnerable to climate change because a large percentage of its GDP (30 percent) is derived from oil and natural gas and because agriculture and tourism play a limited role for the country's economy (NIC 2009), both in terms of GDP and labor force share (only 14 percent of the labor force is employed in the agricultural sector according to the CIA 2011). This may suggest that climate-induced out-migration will not drastically increase due to climate stress. However, Algeria already has to import 45 percent of its food, a percentage that may increase in the future due to increasing desertification, soil erosion, and water shortages, so that climate change may exacerbate the food security situation, leading to refugee flows (Brown and Crawford 2009).
In terms of the policy framework, Algeria has been party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) since 1993, and it ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2005 as a non-Annex I party country. In 1996, Algeria also ratified the Convention on the Fight against Desertification. Key government agencies include the High Council on Environment and Sustainable Development (Haut Conseil de l'Environnement et du Développement Durable) created
in 1994 and charged with evaluating the environmental situation, develop strategies, and follow international policy. The Ministry of Territorial Planning and Environment (Ministère de l'Aménagement du Territoire et de l'Environnement) was created in 2000 and charged with implementing environmental policy. In particular, the ministry is tasked with preventing pollution, protecting biodiversity and natural spaces, promoting environmental education, and managing the National Environmental Fund, which provides funding for environmental protection projects. The General Environmental Inspection (Inspection Générale de l'Environnement) was created in 1996 to oversee the implementation of environmental policy. Other governmental agencies have related mandates, including the Agricultural Ministry and the Ministry for Water Resources. A Law for the Protection of the Environment and Sustainable Development has been adopted, as well as a National Action Plan for the Environment and Sustainable Development (Plan National d'Actions pour l'Environnement et le Développement Durable). The National Scheme of Territorial Management (Schema National d'Aménagement du Territoire) 2030 was approved in 2009.
In terms of projects, one traditional area of focus has been to implement a ""green barrier"" (barrage vert) to reduce desertification and erosion through reforestation in the Saharian Atlas. A project was started in 1996 but halted in the late 1980s. Today, an important initiative is the National Program on Agricultural Development (Programme National de Développement de l'Agriculture) which aims to ensure food security, increase incomes and living standards in the rural regions, and manage scarce natural resources. For 2009 to 2014, 12,000 projects potentially benefiting 12 million people were planned (MATE 2010). Initiatives to secure water supply include the building of 15 new dams between 2004 and 2009 and the planning of 13 additional ones, a pilot desalinization plant in Algier and plans to build 13 such plants across the coast, water recuperation, the building of channels, and a 65 percent increase in irrigated surfaces from 2000 to 2009 (MATE 2010). The National Environmental Strategy (Stratégie Nationale de l'Environment) for the 2001­10 period includes an educational component, targeting for instance teachers and television stations as multipliers. A pilot project launched in 2002 with United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) funded environmental education in 50 schools, and since 2005, environmental education has become part of the school curriculum at the primary and secondary level at 1,000 schools.
Nongovernmental efforts are also underway with funding or technical assistance from donors. For example, in partnership with the government and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and with funding from International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), local actors have defined a development plan for their mountainous region with the aim of reducing rural poverty. Canada's International Development Research Center (IDRC) has funded a project on environmental and natural resources management capacity building to support local researchers through hosting a workshop and through a small grants program from 2003 to 2006. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is planning a number of projects whose goals are to build local
capacity for planning rural development and sustainable management of natural resources (including water and land), and to create stable and diversified income for rural populations. At the request of the national government, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) carried out a program formulation mission that sought to communicate with local and national private and public actors, and to define common guidelines by which these actors could manage their climate change-related projects. And the FAO has been running a Special Program for Food Security since 2005, with around 60 projects and covering around 5,300 households.

Egyptian Context
It is estimated that 2.7 million Egyptians reside abroad (IOM 2010), 70 percent of whom are in other Arab countries, and especially Saudi Arabia (with 0.92 million Egyptians), followed by Libya, Jordan, and Kuwait. Among non-Arab countries, the United States is the most common emigrant destination, with 0.3 million Egyptian immigrants. Highly educated individuals, such as doctors and engineers, are most likely to emigrate permanently (EACH-FOR 2009a). In total, around 5 percent of the tertiary educated were living abroad in 2000 (World Bank 2010). There are no reliable estimates of the extent of illegal emigration, but the Environmental Change and Forced Migration Scenarios (EACH-FOR) report states that ""there are tens--if not hundreds--of Egyptians who have been caught illegally attempting to cross the Mediterranean,"" and the 2007 EU-Egypt Action Plan contains some general clauses on cooperation on migration control (European Union 2007). From 2000 to 2010, the number of foreign-born individuals living in Egypt increased from 170,000 to 245,000 (World Bank 2011). However, these figures are likely to be underestimates. Immigrants include labor migrants from Arab and African countries, Europe and the United States, and refugees from Palestinian, Somali, Ethiopian and Eritrean nationalities.
The most important internal migration flows are from the south to the north, from both south and north to the Canal Zone, and from rural areas to Cairo and Alexandria (Zohry 2005). Over the past decade the urban population growth was at 1.9 percent, which is similar to the national average, so that urbanization remains just below 43 percent. Reasons cited for historic migration include rising population density in areas where agriculture could not be expanded further geographically, decreasing economic opportunities, and unemployment. In addition, involuntary migration occurred in response to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, which displaced 750,000 people, and to the construction of the Aswan Dam, which displaced 100,000 people, primarily of the Nubian ethnicity. While temporary and circular migration­ traditionally very important­ continues to occur, it used to be driven by seasonality, with primarily agricultural workers moving to cities when there was no work for them in rural areas. Today, the seasons appear to have much less of an influence on these circular moves (Zohry 2005).
Egypt has a primarily desert climate. During the winter there are some rains and mild temperatures in the coastal areas of lower Egypt, while upper Egypt is
dry with warm weather. In the summer, the entire country experiences hot and dry weather (EEAA 2010). From 1961 to 2000, mean temperatures were steadily rising, and in Upper Egypt and the Western Desert, the number of days on which temperatures equaled or exceeded 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) increased. The severity and frequency of extreme weather events--including sand storms, dense haze, and flooding--have also been increasing over the 1972 to 2002 period.
Some 80 percent of the water is used in the agriculture sector, which accounted for 13.8 percent of GDP in 2006/07 and employed 55 percent of the Egyptian labor force (EEAA 2010). Because 95 percent of Egyptian agriculture is irrigated and all but 5 percent of Egypt's water supply comes from the Nile River, the impacts of climate change on temperature and precipitation levels and on Nile flows are of vital importance. Under three global circulation models, it is estimated that Nile flows could either decrease by between 10 percent and 75 percent or increase by one third relative to the 1996 level of 84 billion cubic meters (EEAA 2010). In another paper, scenarios predicted losses from 5 percent to 50 percent in 2020; and nine of ten scenarios predicted long-term decreases between 10 percent and 90 percent by 2095 (Strezpek et al. 2001, cited in EEAA 2010). While Egypt is relatively well equipped to deal with one-year droughts through the water stored by the High Aswan Dam, long-term decreases in Nile flows would be a major problem. In addition, it is estimated that solely through the expected rise in temperature the production of major crops will decrease--for instance for rice by 15 percent by 2050 and by 36 percent in 2100 (Abou-Hadid 2006, in EEAA 2010). Land degradation through pollution and salinization may further negatively affect agricultural output (EACH-FOR 2009c).
With a 3,500 kilometers coastline and much of the economy and population being concentrated in these areas, sea-level rises will also have an impact. For instance, El-Raey et al. (1999, in EACH-For 2008) estimates that a 0.18 meter rise would lead to a loss of employment of 32,000 and a rise in half a meter would lead to a loss of 195,000 jobs in Alexandria; and in a recent presentation by Shalaby (2010), it is argued that sea level rises may reduce the Egyptian agricultural area in the Nile delta by 12­15 percent. An environmental factor that is already displacing people today--and which is likely to become more severe in the future--is desertification. Advancing sand dunes in the Western desert are swallowing entire villages, forcing their inhabitants to move (Warner et al. 2008). Thus, Warner et al. found that more than 70 percent of internal migrants that they interviewed in the Nile Delta and Valley, newly reclaimed desert and slums in Old Cairo named land degradation and water shortages as root causes in their migration decision. Another environment factor that may cause future migratory movements is a rise of the sea level. Dasgupta et al. (2007, in EACH-FOR 2009b) predict that a one-meter sealevel rise would displace around 10 percent of the Egyptian population.
Demographic pressures may further influence future migration flows. It is projected that that Egypt's population, which in 2006 was approximately 77 million, will increase to 92­100 million by 2020 and 104­119 million by 2030 (EEAA 2010). This population growth will put strains on the environment, for
instance reducing the available water per capita from 1,000 cubic meters in the early 1990s to 468 cubic meters in 2030, assuming that Egypt will continue to be able to get its current fixed share of Nile water as was laid out in a water sharing agreement in 1959 (EEAA 2010).
The policy framework regulating the use of water from the Nile dates back to a 1959 agreement between the Nile states establishing fixed water quotas. In addition, the Nile Basin Initiative was launched in 1999 with the aim to ""achieve sustainable socioeconomic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile basin water resources,"" such as planning projects on the efficient use of water (EACH-FOR 2009b). Egypt ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1995 as one of the first four countries to do so. The main obligation under the Convention is the formulation of National Action Programs, which Egypt has done in 2005. Egypt signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 and ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2005. As a non-Annex I party country, Egypt is required to submit national communications. A climate change unit was established in 1992 within the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), the executive arm of Egypt's First Minister of State for Environmental Affairs. Its goal is to coordinate all national and international activities related to climate change. The National Committee on Climate Change headed by the Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was established in 1997. It oversees national policies regarding climate change. A variety of other bodies, such as a National Authority for the Clean Development Mechanism, ministerial committees for climate change within the ministries of Agriculture and of Water Resources also exist (EEAA 2010).
An important project under implementation for some time is the New Valley Project with four five-year development plans laid out from 1996 to 2017. Under the project the Ministry of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities was to construct new cities in the Western desert, and millions of Egyptians were to be resettled. This would have extended the populated area from 4 percent to 25 percent of the territory. Five cities were constructed from 1996 to 2006 and other cities were restructured and extended (EEAA 2010). However, even though soil quality in the region is very good, it is one of the hottest places in Africa, and water evaporation and soil salinization are threats (EACH-FOR 2009b). Individuals who have already moved to the region have noted these issues, and also complained about a lack of key infrastructure. Another project is led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation and the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation. The two ministries have developed a plan to reclaim 3.7 million acres of land by 2017, with the required water being procured through a more efficient water use and increasing the use of nonconventional water resources (EEAA 2010). The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, in collaboration with the IFAD and FAO, also develops stress resistant crops and disseminates information in response to climate change.
Due to a growing population, per capita fresh water resources are likely to decline even without decreases in Nile water flows. In response, the 2005 Water Resource Plan by the Ministry of Water Resources aims to improve the irrigation
system, change cropping patterns, and support weed control, rainwater harvesting, desalinization, and so on. (EEAA 2010). The plan, if successful, could increase irrigation by 50­75 percent, and the ministry collaborates with United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in the forecasting of climate change impacts on the Nile flow. Also, compared to other developing countries, Egypt is very engaged in coastal vulnerability assessments, and in carrying out adaptation procedures that respond to current threats, such as beach nourishment projects in Alexandria and the reinforcement of a sea wall. However, relative to the magnitude of changes that may be expected in the future, these projects are not yet sufficient (Agrawala et al. 2004). Finally, in its second national communication under the UNFCC, the EEAA outlines further adaptation, project and research needs and the need to establish a Ministerial Committee headed by the prime minister that would review literature, develop a draft policy for addressing climate change, and develop four five-year plans (EEAA 2010).
Many international organizations are supporting governmental and nongovernmental efforts in various ways. As done for Algeria earlier, a few examples include support the UNDP Global Environmental Facility Small Grants programme, with 60 percent of the 175 grants that were allocated carried out by nongovernmental organizations (EEAA 2010). UNDP also provides expertise to various Egyptian governmental agencies for instance on renewable energy and energy efficiency and on the financing of environmental projects, and on crisis and risk management. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) carries out activities related to refugees in Egypt, on the basis of a 1954 framework agreement between the organization and the Egyptian government (UNHCR 2011). Current FAO projects in Egypt include an assessment of the risks from a sea level rise for groundwater and agriculture in the Nile Delta, the establishment of a monitoring system of the implementation of the sustainable agriculture strategy in 2030, or address income generation activities in rural areas, such as breeding goats or rabbits, for women and youths.

Moroccan Context
International migration by Moroccans has traditionally been and remains primarily directed toward Western Europe. It is estimated that 2 million Moroccans, 85 percent of all emigrants, are currently living in Europe. During the 1960s and 1970s, emigrants were mainly guest workers; from the 1970s to the 1990s, family reunification was the main form of migration. Since then, the share of illegal emigration in migration flows has been on the rise, partly driven by increasing activities in the agricultural and construction sectors in Southern Europe (EACH-FOR 2008). The majority of emigrants are unskilled; but in 2000, nearly 20 percent of tertiary-educated individuals were living abroad (Gubert and Nordman 2009; World Bank 2011). For decades the Moroccan government encouraged emigration for economic and political reasons. More recently, the government has started cooperating with the European Union on the prevention of illegal migration of Moroccans and Sub-Saharan Africans, for whom Morocco
is an important transit country on their way to Europe. For instance, Morocco participates in joint navy patrols, and takes in both Moroccans and other nationals who are apprehended by border forces. In return, the country receives development assistance. It is estimated that there are 10­20,000 illegal immigrants in Morocco (IOM undated).
Internal migration flows are larger than international flows. These movements are predominately rural to urban, which explains why cities have been growing at more than four times the rate as rural areas over the 2000 to 2010 period. During that time, the urbanization rate increased from 53 percent to 56 percent. However, as rural areas and small and medium-sized towns have become more developed partly due to remittances from international migrants, they have become more attractive as destinations in their own right (GCIM 2005).
Morocco's inhabitants are already experiencing deteriorating environmental conditions and shocks that may put their livelihoods at risk, and it is expected that climate change will exacerbate this trend. Shifts include a decrease in precipitation, increasing risks of droughts, more dry areas toward the North of the country, and less ground water. Despite a low per-capita water usage of 500 cubic meters, Morocco is experiencing water stress. These water shortages are predominantly caused by climatic factors in the south and the pressure of population growth in the northern parts of the country (EACH-FOR 2008). More than 80 percent of water is used in agriculture, even though only 13 percent of cropped land is irrigated. The Moroccan government estimates that at least until 2020, subject to sufficient investments in infrastructure, water needs will be met (Kingdom of Morocco et al. 2001). However, the EACH-FOR study (2008) suggests that by 2025, per capita available water resources will have decreased by 30 percent. Under different climate scenarios developed by a consortium of international (World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organization) and national organizations (such as the National Institute for Agricultural Research [INRA]), it is expected that agricultural output will not be drastically affected by climate change until 2030. Subsequently, however, there may be a strong decrease in agricultural output particularly in the northern and center-west parts of the country, where rainwater-based agriculture is currently predominant. The study also points out that the country faces uncertain declines in revenues from irrigation-based agriculture.
In a country where 40 percent of the population is employed in agriculture, and where nearly 70 percent of the poor live in rural areas (World Bank and Agence Française de Développement, undated), environmental shocks and resultant decreases in agricultural output are likely to negatively affect the livelihood of many individuals, and this creates the potential for migration movements. In addition, Morocco has 3,500 kilometers of coastline, so that an increasing number of floods and as well as a rising sea level may also induce future migration movements.
While as for the other countries, there is currently no study that we know of that systematically evaluates how past environment changes influenced migration movements in Morocco, or how it might be expected to do so in the future, a recent report prepared for the U.S. National Intelligence Council (CENTRA
Technology and Scitor Corporation 2009) suggests that ""climatic stress will add to the already substantial movement of population from rural areas into cities"" in Northern Africa, and speculates that the cyclical movements in agricultural output that have been accompanied by cyclical movements of population between rural and urban areas in Morocco in the past might be replicated in the future. Another study points out that following a severe drought in 2007, two thirds of the illegal migrants arrested in Spain were from the farming and mining region of Khouribga (EACH-FOR 2008). This suggests a link between environmental shocks and migration exists, and that at least some of the induced migration will be international. A case study by Hamza, El, and Fermin (Ait Hamza, El Faskaoui, and Fermin 2009) based on a survey of 30 households in two oasis villages in the Middle Draa Valley of Southern Morocco found that environmental degradation was a major factor for either past or intended migration, with lack of access to services and opportunities also being major contributing factors.
In terms of policy framework, Morocco ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1995 and the Kyoto protocol in 2002. As for the other countries, as non-Annex I party country, Morocco is required to submit national communications. Morocco also ratified the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 1996 and it submitted a National Action Plan in 2002. Under the National Action Plan against Climate Change adopted in 2009 plan, the Ministry for Agriculture is responsible for projects including the development of wheat varieties resistant to drought periods and parasites, the creation of systems of irrigation supplemental to present rain-fed cultures and an evaluation the expected impact of climate change on the fish population (Kingdom of Morocco 2009). In addition, the second pillar of the 2008 ""Plan Marco Vert"" (Moroccan Green plan) is specifically aimed at reducing poverty. The more than 300 projects outlined in the plan are expected to target 500,000­600,000 farmers, representing 40 percent of all Moroccan farmers, and to cost 15­16 million dirhams (US$2 million). The aim is to allow farmers to switch to crops that are less sensitive to variations in rainfall, such as olive and almond trees and cacti, to diversify their crop, and to improve agricultural techniques (Aujourd'hui 2008; Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery 2008).
The High Commission for Water, Forests and the Fight against Desertification is responsible for the National Action Plan for the fight against Desertification adopted in 2001. Implementation by 2020 is to include the development of an early warning system against droughts. The Water Department of the State Secretary for Water and Environment is planning a variety of adaptive measures for the 2010­30 period, including building protective structures against floods, developing a plan as well as hydraulic basins for drought periods, educating the public and farmers against water wastage, changing the water pricing system for irrigated agriculture, and so on. The population living at sites with extremely high flood risk is to be relocated, with the Ministry for Housing, Urbanism and Regional Planning charged with such relocations (Kingdom of Morocco 2009). The Department of Environment, following the ratification of the UNFCCC and of the Kyoto protocol, has set up a number of administrative units and committees
that are concerned primarily with developing mitigating rather than adaptive strategies. In addition, the Department of the Environment decided in 2011 to prepare a national strategy on climate change with a national plan including a large number of new activities in the area, especially for water management.
Examples of support provided by donors include four projects financed by Canada's IDRC and the United Kingdom's U.K. Department for International Development (DFID). The projects aim to increase the adaptive capabilities to climate changes of two villages in plane and mountainous regions, address water scarcity and water management in the Saiss Bassin in Northern Morocco, hold workshops for community-based adaptation to desertification and reduction of water resources, and prepare coastal communities to be able to adapt to phenomenon linked to climate change. They are carried out with nongovernmental national partners including INRA, ENFI (National School for Forestry Engineers), and the University Al Akhawayn, and the Réseau marocain des associations en lutte contre la desertification (RIOD Maroc), a Moroccan network of nongovernmental and community-based organizations.
As an example, the project in the coastal areas combined efforts to collect rainwater and to develop new farming and soil preservation techniques in conjunction with the villagers with training efforts for women, such as literacy classes, since women cannot move as easily in response to environmental shocks as men (EMWIS 2010). The IOM has an office in Morocco since 2007, and is principally concerned with voluntary return projects for irregular migrants in the country. An example of a currently ongoing UNDP program is a program intended to increase the adaptability of oases to climate change. It aims to strengthen local long-term planning mechanisms and explore financing options for adaptive measures. The World Bank is currently financing a project on Integrating Climate Change into the Plan Marco Vert. It aims to strengthen the capacity of public and private institutions to integrate climate change adaptations into projects aimed at small farmers in five target regions (World Bank 2011).

Syrian Context
International out-migration is high in Syria, although estimates of its extent vary. According to Kawakibi (2009), 18 percent of Syrians have migrated abroad, and a study by the Syrian Commission for Family Affairs estimated that in 2007, 3.4 million people (15 percent of the total population) lived abroad (Marzouk 2010). But another report by the United Nations stated that in 2005, less than 750,000 Syrians were living abroad (Marzouk 2010). Still, it appears that throughout the 2000s, emigration has increased. While the majority of emigrants during the 1960s and 1970s moved to the Persian Gulf, circular migration with Lebanon, Jordan, and the Gulf states became more common in recent decades. There is also some evidence of brain drain: while only 0.9 percent of Syrians live in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the emigration rate of individuals with tertiary education to these countries in 2000 was 3.7 percent (Dumont 2006).
Syria is also a receiving country for migrants and especially refugees, including Iraqis since 2003 and Lebanese in 2006 (Kawakibi 2009). As a result, while in 2000 5.6 percent of the population was made of immigrants, this had increased to 10.2 percent by 2010 (World Bank 2011). In addition, Khawaja (2002) found that 14 percent of the Syrian population migrated internally from one administrative unit to another at some point during their life, and that around 5 percent migrated during the previous five years. The most common moves are from rural to urban areas, which in 2010 were home to 55 percent of the population, up from 52 percent in 2010 (World Bank 2010). Khawaja sees this as a lower than expected internal migration rate, and suggests that the main reasons for this are the high percentage of people who own their apartment or houses, and the relative equal distribution of access to social services and even wages throughout the country. Surveys indicate that moves for family reasons are more common than those for work-related motives, but internal migration may have recently increased.
Syria is an arid to semi-arid country. A third (32 percent) of the land is cultivated, of which 75 percent is rainfed and 45 percent is pastures. Since the 1980s, the country has been able to meet its own food needs and even export food. However, today the country is witnessing a deteriorating environment and a more adverse climate. Between 1980 and 2006, 13 percent of agricultural land was downgraded because of human activity. Rainfall decreased by 10 millimeters per year (with an annual average of 300 millimeters per year) from 1956 to 2006 (El-Atrache 2009), with large regional variation. For example, the northern and northeastern parts of the country have experienced decreasing precipitation in winter, while the northern and central regions have experienced more rain in autumn (Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs [MSEA] 2010). Summer temperatures have risen significantly, particularly in the coastal zones (MSEA 2010; Qabbani 2010). From 2006 to 2009, Syria experienced a severe drought (Sowers and Weinthal 2010), and droughts may become more common in the future (MSEA 2010). Rises in the sea level will be another potential consequence of climate change, with an estimated 3.8 percent of the coastal population potentially being affected. Among those affected, 2­6,000 farming families may lose their livelihoods and homes (MSEA 2010).
Syria uses 18 billion cubic meters of water per year, in excess of the estimated 15 billion cubic meters of renewable resources. The agricultural sector is responsible for 90 percent of water usage. With an available 1,000 cubic meters of water per capita and year, Syria is on the threshold of water poverty (MSEA 2010). Population growth, decreases in precipitation, pollution, and increased demand due to development are likely to decrease consumption, possibly to 500 cubic meters per person per year in 2025. Syria's first National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reports that between 2010 and 2100, annual precipitation could decrease between 34 and 75 millimeters, and temperatures could rise by 2.8­7 percent (Qabbani 2010). Based on the CROPWAT irrigation management model of the FAO, it was estimated that under these scenarios, irrigated wheat agriculture in the Hassakeh governorate could experience a reduction in yield of 16 percent by the end of
the century, while yields from non-irrigated land could drop by more than 20 percent if no additional irrigation be provided (MSEA 2010).
To the best of our knowledge there are very few systematic studies on how past environmental changes have impacted migration in Syria. Khawaja (2002) did explicitly ask whether environmental problems were related to the decision to move, but the low incidence of individuals naming work or income as reasons for migration may suggest that at least in the late 1990s and early 2000s, climate factors were not a prime motive for migration. However, in a country where 45 percent of the rural population work in agriculture, and 75 percent of the cultivated land is not irrigated, as temperatures rise and precipitation falls, this may change in the future, especially in periods of droughts (Qabbani 2010).
Past experience suggests that migratory movements in response to large-scale environmental shocks may be substantial. For instance, a study by the Canadian International Institute for Sustainable Development suggests that 160 villages in the north-east of the country were entirely abandoned during the 2007/08 period of the current drought that has lasted since 2006 (El-Atrache 2009; Sowers and Weinthal 2010). An assessment mission of the Syrian government and the UN estimated that the drought has affected 1.3 million inhabitants of Eastern Syria. More than 800,000 persons lost their entire livelihood, with smallscale farmers and herders being particularly affected. Many initially tried to react to the drought by selling livestock below prices, reducing food intake, and selling assets (Alqusairi undated), but eventually, an estimated 40,000­60,000 households migrated in response to the drought (DREF 2009). Among these, 200,000­ 300,000 people were from the Al-Hasakeh governorate, representing 13­20 percent of the total previous population and 41­62 percent of the affected population (DREF 2009). Such massive moves put pressure on urban infrastructure, reduce economic growth, and lead to worsening educational and health outcomes among migrants. Unusually, migration was predominantly by entire families, rather than just men.
In terms of policy framework, Syria ratified the UNFCCC in 1996 and signed the Kyoto Protocol in 2005. As the other four countries, it is required to submit national communications. The country ratified the International Convention to Combat Desertification in 1997, and it fulfilled its obligation to submit a National Action Plan in 2002. MSEA was established as the first one in the Arab World. It is primarily engaged in the research into and establishment of mitigation strategies, and is less focused on adaptation (Eido 2006). It is also responsible for applying environmental law (MSEA 2010). The Council for the Protection of the Environment is an interministerial body tasked to set policy and coordinate environmental activities between different ministries (MSEA 2010).
Syria has not yet developed and implemented wide-ranging adaptation policies with regards to climate change. The objectives of the Syrian Agricultural Strategy for 2001­10 did not define sustainability, or adaptation to climate change, as a policy objective (NAPC 2006). The focus was on increasing producers' income, introducing modern technologies and increasing the contribution of the agricultural sector to the country's GDP. The midterm assessment of the strategy showed
increased agricultural productivity, but it appears that aspects of the policy that would lead to a more sustainable agriculture, such as switching to more suitable crops and making the use of modern irrigation techniques more widespread, were still facing difficulties. Nevertheless, in its first National Communication to the UNFCCC, a number of possible future adaptation measures are discussed. These include preparing a national water master plan, enforcing water-related laws and regulations, improving irrigation efficiency and rain collection techniques, rationalizing water use, rehabilitating dams, reviewing agricultural policy under the changed conditions of climate change, further pursuing agricultural research, developing suitable land use policies, and modernizing farm management and farming technology (MSEA 2010). And in response to the most recent drought, the Syrian government and the UN Country Team developed a Drought Response Plan. The government handed out emergency aid, veterinary services, vaccinations, and food assistance (Alqusairi undated; FAO 2009).
In areas with 250­350 millimeters of rainfall per year, as well as in hilly and mountainous areas, the government has implemented a number of policies and projects aimed at improving living conditions, for instance through improving road infrastructure, increasing agricultural productivity, land reclamation, and giving women access to income-generating activities. From 2002 to 2007, the government also implemented a project of unemployment alleviation loans that provided loans to small, intermediate, and large enterprises, as well as household and small project grants. The project was extended and further institutionalized in 2006 (National Agricultural Policy Center [NAPC] 2008). A preliminary evaluation of these policies based on a pilot study concluded that improvements in rural infrastructure and agricultural employment opportunities may have led to increased migration to rural areas, though these are not by any means large enough to offset the large rural-to-urban migration flows (NAPC 2008).
Support by donors for coping with and adaptation to climate change may also be less extensive in Syria than in the four other countries of focus of this study. Examples of such support include the delivery by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent of food parcels to 8,000 families during the recent drought (DREF 2009), and assistance provided by the IOM for the re-settlement of foreign refugees and migration management. The United Nations High Commissioner for refugees also provides various services to Iraqi refugees in Syria.

Yemeni Context
The Republic of Yemenis have been migrating out of the country to oil-producing Arab Gulf States, North America, and Europe for several decades. The current stock of the Republic of Yemeni emigrants is estimated at 1,134,700, or 4.7 percent of the population. Migrants constitute 6 percent of the tertiary-educated population. The main destination countries for migrants remain Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and the United States (Ratha, Mohapatra, and Silwal 2010). The Republic of Yemen is also a country of passage for migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa (Fargues and Bensaad 2007) and a destination for an increasing number of
refugees (UNHCR 2011). Some 60 percent of immigrants are Somali, 30 percent Ethiopian, and 10 percent Eritrean and from other nationalities (Al-Ariqi 2010). Currently, immigrations constitute 2.1 percent of the population.
Internal migration is primarily directed toward urban areas, which constitute an increasing share of total population and are experiencing faster population growth than rural areas. In 2010, urban areas constituted 31 percent of the total population, up from 26 percent in 2000 (World Bank 2011). Although urban population growth rates have fallen slightly between 2000 and 2010 from 4.9 percent per year to 4.7 percent per year, urban population growth is more than twice that of the rural population, at 2.0 percent per year. In addition to voluntary migration, 350,000 individuals have been displaced since 2004 by a violent conflict between insurgents and the government in Northern the Republic of Yemen (IOM 2010).
Although weather data for the Republic of Yemen may be less accurate than for other countries, making it more difficult to construct future climate change scenarios (Al-Tholaya 2010), annual mean temperature appears to have increased by 1.8 degrees Celsius since 1960. Temperatures are expected to increase by 1.2­3.3 degrees Celsius by 2060 and 1.6­5.4 by 2090. Monthly rainfall has fallen by 1.2 millimeters since 1960, a decrease of 9 percent. In the future, sea-level rises may also threaten the coastal cities, in particular Aden (Al-Tholaya 2010).
Predictions about future rainfall trends vary by climatological model, with some models predicting increased rainfall while others predict decreased rainfall (McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009). Decreased rainfall has the potential to harm rainfed agriculture, which constitutes an important fraction of the Republic of Yemen's cereal production (FAOUN 2009). Even without decreases in rainfall, water scarcity will be a challenge due to limited water resources, population growth, and the water use for the production of khat. In 1955, per capita water availability was 1,098 cubic meters, but by 1990 it had fallen to 460 cubic meters per capita (Republic of Yemen 2008). Moreover, projections suggest that under business-as-usual scenarios per capita water availability will fall further to 150 cubic feet (Republic of Yemen 2008).
A study by McKinsey suggests that water shortages could lead to the loss of 750,000 jobs and a decrease in income of 25 percent (Rudolf 2010). In the capital Sanaa in particular, water is currently being extracted at four times the replenishment rate. According to reports based on a World Bank-funded assessment of the Sanaa basin, the capital city's water resources are being depleted by a fast-growing population (IRIN 2010b), and the expanding urban population is due in part to migration from rural to urban areas (Boucek 2009). Projections suggest Sanaa may deplete is economically viable water supplies--primarily groundwater--in a decade (IRIN 2010b; see also Rudolf 2010; Sowers and Weinthal 2010). Extreme weather events are also becoming more common. For instance, Wynter (2009) reports that flash floods are becoming increasingly more common, endangering the life of villagers that live close by.
There is little systematic research into how past environmental change has impacted migration in the Republic of Yemen, but the Republic of Yemen's
population is quite vulnerable to climate shocks. While agriculture generates only 15 percent of GDP, it employs more than 55 percent of the active population. Decreases in agricultural yields are expected in the future, which would impact livelihoods. Some 84 percent of the rural poor are dependent on rainfed subsistence agriculture, a form of agriculture that is highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change (World Bank 2010). Environmental changes affecting the agricultural sector could increase rural to urban migration.
The Republic of Yemen became party to the UNFCCC in 1992, and signed the Kyoto protocol in 2004. As a non-Annex I party country, it is required to submit national communications. The Republic of Yemen is also party to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. In 2008, the government adopted a plan by the Ministry of Water and Environment to increase available water resources. The plan calls for assessing climate change impacts on water resources and improving climate monitoring. The plan first targeted Sanaa, calling for the city to gather and harvest 70 percent of its rainwater in by 2012. By 2020, the plan calls for 40 percent rainwater to be harvested in the rest of the country (Sorel 2010). However, there has been little visible progress toward these goals (IRIN 2010a). In 2009, the Environmental Protection Authority outlined 22 adaptation projects that were identified as the most urgent through a participatory process with multiple local and national stakeholders. The proposed projects include rainwater harvesting, disaster preparedness to extreme weather events, desalinization of sea water, promotion of modern irrigation technologies, improved crop management, establish a national research center on climate change and adaptation issues, develop and implement sustainable land management strategies, and construct coastal defenses. Financing would come from donors and implementing agencies would include the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, the Ministry of Water and Environment, the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority, and the Marine Science and Biological Research Authority. With the Republic of Yemen being a pilot country under the World Bank's Pilot Program for Climate Resilience with the Minister of Water and Environment and the EPA as the main contact points, US$1.5 million are available for adaptation projects (Climate Facts Update, 2010).
Examples of projects being supported by donors include a US$13.5 million grant by the US government through the World Food Program to support humanitarian efforts (Sorel 2010). IOM activities in the Republic of Yemen include technical cooperation and training (funded by the European Union) on migration and border management, hosting conferences on labor migration with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries as well as Somalia and Ethiopia, assisting government agencies with the fight against human trafficking, and providing emergency assistance to families displaced by the 2008 flooding in Hadramout and by conflict in northern the Republic of Yemen (Al-Ariqi 2010). Among other activities, UNDP assists the Republic of Yemen with preparing its second National Communication to UNFCCC, provides capacity and institutional building, strategic planning and basin level water governance and management to manage the Republic of Yemen's water resources, and provides technical
assistance to help local authorities manage the recovery process after the 2008 flooding. The UNHCR provides assistance both to international displaced refugees and to, in particular, Somali refugees . Among other activities, the FAO provides poor smallholder farmers with improved drought-resistance seeds, as well as fertilizers (FAO 2009).

Conclusion
The objective of this chapter was to explain the rationale for the choice of the focus countries in this study, and provide contextual background on each of the five countries. The focus countries were chosen because they tended to have large populations, be vulnerable to extreme weather events and especially droughts, represented various settings in terms of socioeconomic conditions, and provided access to other available data sources in some cases, on top of the data being collected specifically for the study. As to the contextual background about the countries, information was provided on traditional patterns of international and domestic migration as well as on the challenges faced by the various countries regarding climate change, and the ways the countries have organized themselves institutionally to respond to those challenges. While the countries are diverse, they do appear to face many common challenges.
CHAPTER 3
Data Collection
Nicholas Burger, Bonnie Ghosh-Dastidar, Audra Grant, George Joseph, Teague Ruder, Olesya Tchakeva, and Quentin Wodon

A large part of this study is based on data collected in 2011 in five focus countries of the MENA region. In addition, other existing data sources were used as well, as documented in the various chapters that follow, but this need not be discussed in this chapter. This chapter documents the process followed and some of the choices made for new data collection, both quantitative and qualitative, for the study on climate change and migration in the MENA region. After a brief introduction, we explain the nature of the household survey questionnaire, what it enables us to document, as well as some of its limits. Next, we explain how the household survey sites were selected and how the samples were constructed in each of the five focus countries. We also provide a few comments on the challenges encountered during survey implementation. The chapter finally explains the process used for the focus group discussions and in-depth interview, as well as for the interviews with key informants conducted in each country.

Introduction
Having explained the rationale for the choice of focus countries for this study and having provided general background on each of the five countries in c hapter 2, this chapter documents the process followed and the choices made for new data collection in the five focus countries--Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. Documenting these choices is important because much of the effort under this study in terms of staff time and study costs consisted in collecting and analyzing new data in the five countries--that is, household surveys and qualitative focus groups as well as in-depth household interviews and key informants interviews. But documenting these choices is also important to clarify what the study can and cannot do-- what it can inform us about, but also what it cannot inform us about given the data's limits in terms of representativeness as well as the types of questions asked and to whom.
We first describe briefly the nature of the household survey questionnaire, and especially the questions in the survey what it enables us to do, as well as some of its limits. In each of the five focus countries the same household survey
was implemented, with only minor adaptations to take into account country characteristics. The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections, many of which were designed to gather background information on household members. But the three chapters that have been written in this study using the household surveys focus on the questions related to household perceptions of climate change, coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, and finally both temporary and permanent migration.
Next, we explain how the household survey sites were selected in each of the five countries and how the survey samples were constructed in each subarea. We also provide a few comments on weights and on some of the challenges encountered during survey implementation. Data collection was not easy. In Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, the quantitative and qualitative fieldwork was interrupted by the 2011 Arab Spring events, causing delays of weeks and, in some cases months, with frequent interruptions in fieldwork once the data gathering resumed. While these events did not appear to affect responses in the survey, the teams implementing the survey had to be flexible in order to adapt. In addition, in the Republic of Yemen interviewers faced some intimidation and threats to their physical security, which caused further delays in data collection there.
Finally we provide background on the objectives of the qualitative data collection, as well as the process followed and techniques used, such as probing on specific questions. As was the case for the survey data collection, data collection was challenging in some countries. In the Republic of Yemen the deteriorating security conditions made focus group recruitment very difficult, which led to a switch from focus groups to in-depth interviews for that country. In Algeria, focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion. Time constraints and worries about the spread of Arab Spring dynamics prevented sustained efforts at focus groups recruitment, so that in that country as well the team opted for indepth interviews. We also discuss the approach used for interviews with key informants, who included government officials as well as researchers and representatives of nongovernmental and international organizations.
The structure of the chapter follows closely the above discussion. After explaining some of the characteristics of the household survey questionnaire in section two, section three is devoted to the process followed for collecting the household survey data. Section four discusses the qualitative data collection through focus groups in Egypt, Morocco, and Syria, and in-depth interviews in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as well as interviews with key informants. A brief conclusion follows.

Household Survey Questionnaire
In each of the five focus countries the same household survey was implemented, with only minor adaptations to take into account country characteristics. The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections, many of which were designed to gather background information on household members, including on
demographics, education, health, and occupation, as well as household wellbeing. Three chapters have been written in this study using the household surveys conducted in the five countries. This section briefly describes the data used in each of the three chapters, and the types of questions in the survey which make this analysis feasible.
Chapter 4 focuses on household perceptions of extreme weather events and climate change, and the impact of adverse events on their livelihood. The analysis is based on three main questions. First, households are asked if they have noticed any changes in weather patterns in the last five years, with the potential changes identified in the questionnaire including more erratic rainfall, less or more rain, more frequent droughts, floods, or sandstorms, and changes in temperatures, among others. Next household are asked if, again compared to five years ago, they have noticed changes in their environment--these would include deforestation, livestock losses, crop failures, water pollution, less fertile land, and so on. Finally, households are asked if they experienced losses of crops, income, livestock, or fish as a result of changes in weather patterns.
Chapter 6 looks at the ways through which households cope with the impact of adverse weather events, and how they adapt to changes in the climate and their environment. On coping, households who declare that they have experienced a loss of crops, income, livestock, or fish due to weather shocks or changes in the environment are asked if they used the following coping strategies: (1) Selling or pawning livestock; (2) Selling or pawning assets other than livestock, such as land or jewelry; (3) Withdrawing children from school; (4) Using their savings; and finally (5) Asking for a loan. Households who did not experience a loss linked to an adverse weather events are asked whether they would rely on the same coping mechanisms in case they would experience such a loss. On adaptation, households are asked whether they have taken specific actions to adapt to changing conditions. Many different actions are listed in the questionnaire, including changing in the timing of planting, changing the source of water used, drilling boreholes, changing production technologies or crop choices, increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides, seeking or increasing off-farm employment, and so on. Similar questions are asked about the community level response to climate change, and about the availability of government programs that could help households cope with and adapt to climate change.
Finally, chapter 7 looks at the relationship between household perceptions of climate change and whether household members have migrated either temporarily (this is referred to as resident migration because the member still resides in the household), or permanently (this is referred to as nonresident migration). The analysis is made possible through information asked about migration not only among current household members, but also among those who used to live in the household and have left permanently. There are however limits to the analysis that can be conducted with such data. First, because the surveys were implemented in sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we do not record information on the migration of entire households--we only record the migration of household members. Second, it is difficult to distinguish the
separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses. It could be that household perceptions of climate change are wrong--for example, even if households declare that rainfalls are becoming more erratic, this may not be the case in reality. At the same time, one could argue that decisions such as that of migrating are influenced at least as much by the perceptions of households of the reality as by the reality itself. Also, questions in the survey about the reasons for migration provide a way of checking whether the estimates of the impact of perceptions on migration in the regression analysis are of a reasonable order of magnitude.
It must be emphasized that because the surveys are not nationally representative and were implemented only in two sending areas affected by extreme weather events, as discussed in the next section, we are not able to provide estimates of migration by entire households away from the sending areas--we only record the migration of household members.
To mitigate this weakness, we also conducted work with nationally representative data. For Morocco, we used the nationally representative Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented between December 2009 and March 2010. Much of the questionnaire of that survey focuses on issues critical to youth, such as the obstacles they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation. But the questionnaire also included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks. Being aware that the survey would be implemented, we were able to add additional questions on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions. Those data are then used for two chapters in the study on, respectively, the ability of households to cope with weather and other shocks (chapter 5), and the migration decisions of household members (chapter 10). For the Republic of Yemen we used data from the latest census and the latest national integrated household survey to conduct additional analysis of migration patterns. The census data were used together with other data (including climatic data) to analyze the determinants of migration rates between districts (chapter 9). The national household survey was used to analyze who benefits from remittances from international and domestic migrants, and what impact those remittances have on the welfare and human development indicators of the households who receive them, and whether this impact depends on where the beneficiary households live (chapters 11 and 12). The fact that we are able to rely on national data for Morocco and the Republic of Yemen helps in placing some of the findings from the new household surveys in a broader context, so that the use of the two types of data complement each other.

Household Survey Data Collection Survey Sites Selection In each of the five countries the same household survey was implemented in two predominantly rural areas. These two areas were located in regions that are
considered to be vulnerable to climate-induced environmental degradation in the agricultural sector and are also areas that have produced significant out-migration internal to the countries. In other words, the regions were chosen based on existing environmental conditions and on their contribution to internal migration patterns. The majority of the areas have been subjected to long-term drought and water scarcity or incidence of flooding. While there is ongoing debate regarding whether the sources of climate change are caused by human actions or by natural climatic factors, the selection of the areas was meant to reflect the latter. In practice, we relied for the selection of the areas on recommendations from climate change and environment experts in the respective countries, population and migration experts, ministry officials, and existing information from a wide variety of sources on climate and migration trends in each country. The remoteness of the areas and security risks also influenced survey site selection. Official approval from ministries in each country was obtained to conduct the survey in each survey site. The sample size in each area was 400 households for a total of 800 households in each of the five countries.

In Algeria, two sites were selected. M'Sila is located in the Steppe region and has been classified by the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture and the National Centre for Spatial Techniques as an area that is ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification. Approximately, 62 percent of the region has been designated as such. Djelfa is also located in the Steppe zone and has similarly been designated as ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification. In that region, approximately 500,000 hectares of land are in the process of desertification and more than seven million hectares are under threat of desertification.
In Egypt, the first area chosen area was Dakhalia in the Northeast. Experts at the Cairo College for Engineering indicate that water consumption has increased 17 percent owed to hotter and longer summers there. In the governorate of Dakhalia, approximately 11,000 hectares of land in 2010 were no longer viable as a result of poor weather conditions, which has caused diminished water supply for agriculture. Farmers staged regular protests outside of the governor's office demanding initiative to improve availability of water. The second region is Sharqia, also in the Northeast. Similar water scarcity has damaged rice farms causing farmers to use sewage water for irrigation purposes. The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics reports that water resources in Egypt will decline by 15 billion cubic meters by 2017 in these and other areas throughout the country, a significant decrease from the requirement of 86.2 billion. Each of
the above areas is a supplier of migrants to other areas within Egypt, mostly to urban areas, such as Cairo, a major destination for rural migrants who seek to escape poverty. These survey areas were approved by officials and researchers associated with the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency.
In Morocco, the first site was Chichaoua in the Plains Region. Chichaoua Province has been affected by drought over recent decades. The pattern has been accompanied by severe drought events. The second region is Al-Gharb in the Northwest. The Al-Gharb plain is Morocco's second largest agricultural producing region. In 2009, Al-Gharb accounted for roughly 35 percent of the country's cereal acreage. Al-Gharb has been severely affected by flash flooding from the Sebou River--events exacerbated by heavy snowfall and rains--which began in 2009. Thousands were displaced amid loss of homes and shelter and significant damage to infrastructure and agricultural production. Yet, Gharb also suffers from cycles of lack of rainfall. In 2011, for example, rainfall decreased by 14 percent. The area was recommended by Moroccan government officials and is an outlier among the survey sites, an area that has been affected by short-term weather events in the form of a natural disaster.
In Syria, the first area is Al-Hassakeh in the North. The region has been afflicted by drought and land degradation over a long period. The Qamishle and al-Shadaddi districts have been particularly affected. Tens of thousands of Syrians have been displaced from al-Hassakeh as a result of severe drought. The second
area is Deir ez Zour in the East. Like al-Hassakeh, Deir ez Zour to the east have also suffered from drought and land degradation. In both al-Hassekh and Deir ez Zour, approximately 1.3 million have been profoundly affected by drought especially since 2008, and according to the Syrian government, some 800,000 are vulnerable. Though precise figures are difficult to acquire, between 40,000 and 60,000 families are estimated to have migrated, including 35,000 from al-Hassekeh alone. Both Deiz Ezzor and al-Hassakeh are home to crops considered strategic by the Syrian government, such as wheat, cotton and barley. Metropolitan Damascus has been a major destination for rural migrants for many decades.
In the Republic of Yemen, the two areas were Hudaydah in the West and Taiz in the South. Both areas are designated as high-drought risk areas. About a third of the Republic of Yemen's poor are concentrated in these areas. Taiz has been
affected by both long-term water scarcity and acute drought, the latter occurring since 2008 causing significant displacement. The situation in Taiz is more severe, however, as the region faces a humanitarian situation in 2011 caused by the collapse of the Salah government last year. Civil unrest and violence have compounded water scarcity as health care, education, and physical security are threatened. Taiz is among the areas in the Republic of Yemen suffering from the most severe water shortages. Rainfall has decreased or ceased all together since late 2008-early 2009, depleting ponds and tanks which are the typical reservoirs of natural rainfall for the agricultural sector.



Sample Design and Weights For each country, the target was to implement the survey with a sample of 800 households. Sample selection followed a general framework, with variations on how household units were selected depending on the country. Each country was first divided into two strata composed of: (1) areas with high level of environmental degradation, and (2) areas with low level of environmental degradation. Only areas in stratum 1 with high level of environmental degradation were eligible for inclusion in this study. In each country, two areas with high environmental degradation and high migration were selected. These areas were typically selected systematically, but nonrandomly, because of factors such as importance, size, or location.
Thus, we cannot produce weights that generalize the sample of households in these two areas to produce country-level statistics, not only because this would not be appropriate with only two areas surveyed but also because we do not have a probability of selection of these two areas. Instead, where feasible we estimated household-level weights to generate representative statistics from each sample of households for their respective area. But again, the weighted area-level summaries may not be representative of the country with respect to level of environmental problems, degradation, and migration due to nonrandom selection of these areas into the study.
The survey implementation was supervised by Rand under contract with Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the World Bank. In each country, Rand worked in partnership with local teams: the University of Algiers in Algeria, IPSOS Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in Egypt and Syria, TNS Global in Morocco, and the Market Research Organization (MRO) in the Republic of Yemen. In each of the two areas sampled per country, a multistage sampling design was carried. Figure 3.1 visualizes how the sample was selected in each of the five countries, but household selection rules were country specific and are described below.
The Algeria sample was split evenly between the prefectures Djelfa and M'sila. Within each prefecture, 10 administrative districts were selected with probability proportionate to size using the 2008 district population as the measure of size. The number of households per district was then allocated proportionately, with more interviews in larger municipalities. In the absence of a complete listing of dwellings in each prefecture, households were selected within districts using a random selection algorithm in the field. The 2008 population sizes of each district used for designing the sample as well as the number of interviews per district are listed in table 3.1.
In Egypt, the sample was split evenly between the two governorates of Dakhalia and Sharqia. Within each governorate, the selection of villages was dictated by the Egyptian government authority approving the survey (the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency). This means that villages were selected in a nonrandom fashion. Nine villages were selected in Dakhalia and 16 in Sharqia. The allocation of interviews across villages within each governorate was done using a probability proportionate to size approach, with the number of households in the village being used as the measure of size. The number of households was obtained

from 2006 general census by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS). For the selection of households within a village, fieldwork supervisors selected random starting points within each village. Each interviewer was advised to start by selecting the first house to the right of the starting point. The interviewer then attempted to conduct an interview with every fourth building. In case of a refusal, the interviewer moved to the next housing unit to complete a questionnaire. If the next housing unit had multiple apartments, only one
was selected to complete an interview. A maximum of 8­10 interviews were conducted at each point. Table 3.2 provides the population size of each sampled village, along with the number of interviews completed per village.
In Morocco, the sample was evenly split between the regions of Al-Gharb and Chichaoua. Within each region, 10 strata were defined and 40 households were sampled per stratum under an equal allocation design (see table 3.3). The 40 households were selected in two stages to improve efficiency of fieldwork. First a

random sample of douars (villages) was selected from a complete listing of douars in each region, although douars with less than 100 households were not selected. Second, in the absence of a complete listing of households within each douar, an algorithm was used to ensure a random sample of households in a way similar to that of Egypt. The starting point was the village center. In cases where the population in the douar was dense, a pattern of skipping three households was implemented. Interviewers adhered to the ""right-hand rule"" so that interviews were conducted on the right-hand side of the road/path/""street."" Random selection of roads/paths was not possible in rural areas similar to urban areas. Instead, a path was specified by the supervisor and two people followed a path in opposite directions (for example, north and south or east and west). The first household along the path was selected, with skipping of three households in dense areas. If no one was at home, the interviewers proceeded to the next house along the road/path/street. To avoid excessive clustering, no more than 20 households were selected from the largest douars, for a total of 40 household interviews per stratum.
The Syria survey was implemented in the governorates of Alhasaka and Deir Ezzor. Within Alhasaka, six areas/provinces and 20 villages were selected from two of the four districts. Multiple provinces and areas in Alhasaka were not eligible for inclusion due to safety concerns, no relevant climate/weather impacts, and language issues for areas that bordered Iraq. In Deir Ezzor, 10 areas/provinces and 16 villages were selected. These areas/provinces represented all three districts in Deir Ezzor. Thus, the sample in Deir Ezzor has better coverage than that in Alhasaka. Highly urban areas, such as the city centers, were excluded from both samples. The total number of interviews was divided equally between the two governorates. Within each district, areas were selected using a random sampling approach (with certain exclusion criteria noted above). Within areas, the number of interviews was proportionately allocated based on population size. One or more villages were randomly chosen in each area, although villages that were very small and where local government permission was denied by the mayor were excluded. In Alhasaka and Deir Ezzor, 20 and 15 villages were sampled from the 6 and 10 areas, respectively. The details on the location of the sample are provided in table 3.4.
Finally, the the Republic of Yemen sample was split between the governorates of Taiz and Hudayda according to population (58 percent of the sample in Taiz and 42 percent in Hudayda, see table 3.5). Interviews were completed in 15 villages within Taiz and 11 villages within Hudayda. The primary reasons for selecting the 15 villages in Taiz and 11 villages in Hudayda were the distribution of population, community variety, local knowledge, and the observed degree of environmental degradation. The most critical areas with respect to environmental problems were chosen in both governorates. The total sample size within each governorate was allocated across the chosen villages on the basis of number of households on the basis of data produced by the the Republic of Yemen Central Statistical Organization. Each village was divided into different sectors (or neighborhoods) and interviews were divided equally among the two sectors. In each

sector the interviewers contacted every third household by location to achieve quasi randomness.
Household sampling weights are usually defined as the inverse of the probability of selection of a household in a sample. In general, the probability of selection of a household consists of two components. The first component can be


denoted as P(district), the probability with which a district or other subarea is selected within a prefecture or governorate. The second component is the probability of selection of a household within a district, P(household|District). With a random selection of households within a district, this is the ratio of the number of interviews competed in a district and the population size of the district. The probability for a household to be selected is then P(Selection)=P(district)× P(household|District) and the sampling weight is 1/P(Selection). This is the approach used for assigning households weights in Algeria.
In Morocco, given that villages were randomly selected from each stratum, they have an equal probability of selection. This then simplifies the probability of selection of households, which is simply the ratio of the total number of household interviewed in a stratum and the size of the stratum. That is, P(Selection) = Number of interviews/Number of families in an area, with again the sampling weight defined as the inverse of the probability of selection. In Syria, the sample was essentially self-weighted (equal probability of selection for all households), given that the areas within districts were selected randomly, and so were the households within districts. In Egypt, due to the nonrandom selection of villages, it is not advisable to produce weights (within villages, households were selected randomly). Similarly, due to the systematic selection of villages within governorates in the Republic of Yemen, sample weights are also not provided (again, within villages households were selected randomly, but villages themselves were not).
Challenges in Survey Implementation In Algeria data collection ran from April to October, 2011. Interviewers participated in training and orientation sessions before going to the field, lasting approximately three days. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews, after securing permission from local leaders in each district. The primary fieldwork challenges in order to access households were related to transport, hot weather, and long distances between villages and houses. There were also difficulties with some families who did not want to answer questions, because they thought the questions were an intrusion into their personal life. The interview teams went to great lengths to explain to farmers the nature of the survey and reassure them that the goal was not to probe into their private lives. Although some households refused to participate in the survey and some did not complete the entire questionnaire, he overall nonresponse was less than 1.5 percent. The survey took on average 1.5 hours to complete.
In Egypt, data collection ran from May (following a delayed start) to June 2011. Fieldwork training lasted two days and covered detailed descriptions of the questionnaire contents, the importance of probing for particular questions, and role playing activities to gain experience with the questionnaire. The interview teams consisted of 29 individuals (23 male, 6 female). Household refusals to participate in the field were primarily due to the length of the questionnaire and the personal nature of questions. A total of 99 households refused to participate and 133 people showed reservations when asked questions on personal life details. The supervisors for the data collection team were responsible for quality control, which included accompanying interviewers to household visits (20 percent of interviews), checking a subsample of questionnaires for accuracy (20 percent of interviews), and telephone call backs (35 percent of interviews). Double data entry was conducted for 15 percent of the questionnaires as an additional test. Some problems we reencountered during interviews, including respondents who were observed to give any answer just to finish the interview, respondents that did not take the survey seriously, and interruptions from other people in the household during the interview.
In Morocco, fieldwork was completed between April and May 2011. The field team consisted of approximately 20 interviewers, and training for the interviewers lasted three days. The training for the Chichaoua team was held in Marrakech, while the training for the Al Gharb team was held in Casablanca. A relatively large number of households refused to participate in the survey (144), but there were no major challenges associated with the fieldwork and household refusal rates were not tied to any particular issues other than general challenges with length and sensitivity to certain questions.
In Syria, fieldwork was carried out between March and June 2011. Interviewers were trained during separate training sessions for each region, with each training session lasting one day. The training included interview procedures, questionnaire review, and mock interviews. Supplemental training was done at the start of fieldwork and following supervisor review of initial completed interviews. The survey teams comprised 35 individuals, including interviewers, supervisors, and
the office team. A total of 1,200 households were contacted for 800 successful interviews, with a rate of unsuccessful interviews of 8 percent. Average interview length was just under one hour. Interview teams encountered security problems in many villages, and they were required to secure approvals to be allowed to work in most villages. Four villages refused to participate in the survey. Other challenges included transportation and lack of roads to some remote villages. Supervisors reviewed completed questionnaires, accompanied interviewers on household visits (for 31 percent of the interviews), conducted debriefing sessions with interviewers, and conducted telephone-based data verification (for 24 percent of interviews).
In the Republic of Yemen the survey took place between June 2011 and February 2012--with significant periods of nonactivity due to violence in the areas where the survey was being implemented. The survey team consisted of 26 individuals, including 7 supervisors. The fieldwork teams faced a number of access-related obstacles, including difficult terrain and lack of transportation. Some respondents were reluctant to provide their names or the names and personal information of their family members. Because of these and other challenges, participation refusal rates were at around 30 percent across both survey areas.

Qualitative Data Collection
Focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews were also implemented in the five countries for this study. Focus groups are a set of individuals that are selected and assembled to discuss a given topic of research from the perspective of personal experience. The conduct of focus groups is based on the assumption that: participants have a specific experience of or opinions about the topic under investigation. An explicit interview guide is used and the varied experiences of participants are explored in relation to a set of predetermined research questions.
Focus group research draws upon respondents' attitudes, sentiments, beliefs, experiences and reactions in ways that are not feasible using other methods--for example, observation, one-to-one interviewing, or survey questionnaires. These attitudes, feelings and beliefs may be partially independent of the group's social setting, but the social and interactive environment provided by a focus group can help respondents articulate and further reflect upon views. Compared to individual interviews, which target individual attitudes and impressions, focus groups elicit an array of views and psychological processes in a group context.
The original intent was to conduct focus groups in the five countries. But as mentioned in the introduction, lack of security in the Republic of Yemen made focus group recruitment difficult, and in n Algeria, focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion. In both countries, this led to a shift toward semistructured in-depth interviews which provide similarly rich and textured information. In such interviews individuals engage in a discussion themselves and are posed open-ended questions not unlike the question-answer process in a focus group setting.
Focus groups and in-depth interviews either can be used at the preliminary stages of a study to inform other aspects of research or may be used to confirm findings produced from other research methods, such as following a quantitative survey. In such a scenario, focus groups are useful as a confirmatory method that may valid certain hypotheses or assumptions about attitudes, emotional processes, or understandings of concepts. In other words, they can help explain survey findings. Yet as with any method, focus groups and in-depth interviews are not without their limitations. First, neither method permits sweeping generalizations across entire populations. This is because focus group samples are not representative of large populations. Second, the moderator risks the loss of control over the direction and tenor of focus group discussion. Group interactions and dynamics are strongly influenced by the dialogue created by participants. Consequently, the moderator may have difficulty controlling the flow of discussion. Third, and related to the previous limitation, is the difficulty in drawing out and isolating individual viewpoints. Since focus group and interview participants speak in specific contexts, and within specific cultures, it may be difficult to clearly identify an individual attitude. Still, both approaches can also be used as an evaluative tool to assess reactions to policies and events and are also useful as points of departure for future research through generating hypotheses.
The qualitative fieldwork was conducted among adults 18 years of age and older in each country between November 2010 and February 2012. Implementation dates varied by country due to Arab Spring protests and government collapse which interrupted fieldwork in Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, starting in January 2011. Although the results do not appear to be seriously affected, there is some mention of concern about the security situation related to Arab Spring events among Egyptian focus group respondents. Results are based on the conduct of seven focus groups in Morocco, Egypt, and Syria, with each group comprising six to eight participants: four focus groups among urban migrants, who have relocated internally from rural areas; and three focus groups in each rural area among rural residents. The structure of the focus groups was determined by assumptions and hypotheses believed to be critical in informing respondent attitudes and their adaption strategies. The rural and urban groups were comprised of both men and women, and the groups were divided by age, gender and socioeconomic status. In Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as already mentioned, semi-structured interviews were conducted instead.
In order to accurately capture variation in attitudes, respondents were recruited from select areas referred to as rural or ""sending areas"" and urban or ""receiving areas."" Rural or ""sending areas"" are often the source of internal migrants moving to cities, and were selected for this study based on their long-term physical exposure to environmental degradation and declining agriculture, as well as corollary trends of rural outmigration to other areas internal to countries. The rural areas were also the sites of household surveys mentioned in the previous section. In other words, the rural focus group sites in Algeria (M'Sila), Morocco (Lamzoudia), Egypt (Dakhalia), Syria (al-Hassakeh), and the Republic of Yemen (Hudaydah) were chosen based on the extent of documented environmental degradation and
Climate Change and Migration · http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-0-8213-9971-2
of rural out-migration patterns. ""Receiving areas,"" by contrast, are urban areas that are common destination points for internal migrants seeking better opportunities. These were selected based on trends of rural to urban migration. In most cases, these areas were among the countries' largest, most populous cities. Thus, in Algeria, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen, the urban focus group sites were Algiers, Casablanca, Cairo, Damascus, and Sanaa. Table 3.6 provides more details on the qualitative research sites.
Respondents were randomly recruited door-to-door using a screening questionnaire that filtered for select demographic characteristics. For receiving areas, involvement in agricultural activity prior to migrating was a critical selection criterion for those recruited in urban neighborhoods. Migrants had to have come from households that relied solely on agriculture as the main source of income, and relocated to urban areas due to unfavorable agricultural conditions in their homes of origin within the last 10 years. All rural respondents in sending areas were selected based on the primacy of agriculture as the main source of economic activity. Respondents for in-depth interviews were also recruited similarly to focus group respondents.
Discussions in focus groups and in-depth interviews in urban areas were organized around nine questions, with probing for specific aspects or sub-question within each of the main nine question. The nine questions were as follows: (1) What would you say the biggest problem facing your household these days?; (2) As you know, some people who live in this area have relocated from other places. From where did you relocate?; (3) Why did you leave?; (4) Before you decided to move, what did you do to try to survive in your village?; (5) How dependent is/was your family on financial help from other family members living in other areas or abroad?; (6) When we choose to relocate to another area, we may relocate to a particular area based on certain factors. Why did you choose this town and neighborhood?; (7) Since you have relocated here what are the biggest problems or challenges you have faced?; (8) Are you aware of any government programs that are targeted for people who have relocated for the reasons you described?; and finally (9) Under what circumstances would you return to your previous home?
Similarly, the qualitative work in rural areas was organized around a core set of eight questions, and some probing within each. The questions were as follows: (1) Thinking about where you live now, including the surrounding conditions, what would you say is the biggest problem facing your community today?; (2) Some people believe that this area has been affected by poor weather conditions, and by this, I mean drought, storms, or flooding. To what extent has this been a problem in your view? In what ways have poor weather conditions affected the daily life of your household?; (3) How dependent is/was your family on financial help from other family members living in other areas or abroad?; (4) Sometimes, the weather is not very good and farming is difficult. What kinds of programs are you aware of that are intended to help you improve conditions in your community and for your household?; (5) Imagine a situation where there was a major flood or drought here and you were completely unable to earn an income from
farming. What would the four things you would be most likely to do in order to survive?; (6) Some of you mention that you would move somewhere else in our country. To what town or city would you most likely move?; (7) Why would you move there?; and finally (8) Once you would have moved to this area, what would you do to earn a living and survive?
In addition to the focus groups or in-depth household interviews, interviews with key informants were also carried in each of the five countries. In each country, a dozen government officials were interviewed and a dozen additional respondents were contacted from various organizations, including universities, international organizations, and nongovernmental organization (NGO)s. For government officials, the questions asked were as follows: How important an issue is climate change--has it become more of a priority for your government?; Why has climate change become an important concern? Do you see climate change as a significant problem in the future?; How has environmental degradation affected rural populations in particular? What about urban areas that are attract rural migrants?; What are the challenges facing policy makers in dealing with climate change migration? What are the gaps in knowledge and resources?; What is the government doing about rural-urban migration? Is there any public assistance available to migrants and rural populations affected by environmental degradation? Can you please describe them to me?; What is the government planning to do?; What do you think is the level of public awareness about existing programs?; Why has it been difficult to address this issue?; If there are no programs, what kinds of programs would be most beneficial in your view?.
For nongovernmental experts, the main questions were as follows: How has climate change affected this country? In your view, has is contributed significantly to environmental degradation? And how do you think climate change will affect the country in the future?; How has environmental degradation affected rural populations in particular? Do certain populations, such as women and girls, bear a greater burden?; What kinds of problems are you seeing?; Some people may choose to relocate to other areas as a coping mechanism. What is the profile of a typical migrant in this country? In other words what type of person migrates and why?; To where do people tend to migrate in this country and why?; Have these patterns and destinations changed over time to your knowledge?; What sorts of challenges do migrants face when they relocate from one place to another? What are the political, social, economic, health-related, and practical challenges that migrants face?; Not everyone is able relocate. What would you say are the biggest obstacles to migration?; Many migrants face various kinds of environmental shocks, such as floods and or drought. These shocks often affect agricultural productivity and thus income and the very livelihood of households. How do migrants cope to these situations? What survival strategies do they adopt?; Is there any government assistance available to migrants and rural populations affected by environmental degradation?; Is there any nongovernment assistance available to migrant and rural populations affected by environmental degradation?; What do you think is the level of public awareness about existing programs?; And if there are no programs, what kinds of programs would be most beneficial in your view?
Conclusion
New data collection on perceptions of climate change and migration decisions was a key component of this study. This chapter has documented the process followed and the choices made for data collection, both quantitative and qualitative. The discussion of the data collection for the household surveys included a review of key questions in the survey questionnaire, as well as the sampling design and some of the challenges encountered during survey implementation. For qualitative data collection, we discussed the approach used in the various countries and its rationale, as well as the main questions that were asked not only in focus groups, but also in in-depth interviews, and in the interviews with key informants.
Perhaps the most important point to emphasize again in concluding this chapter is the fact that neither the household surveys nor the focus groups and the other qualitative data are representative of the countries as a whole in which they were implemented, since they are only representative (or quasi-representative in some cases) of the areas selected for fieldwork. Yet the data are illustrative of the conditions prevailing in the five countries, and since these countries account for a large share of the population in the region, they are also illustrative for the region as a whole, or at least as much as they could be given constraints in the size of the samples.

CHAPTER 4
Perceptions of Climate Change, Weather Shocks, and Impacts on Households
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

What are the perceptions of households in the Middle East and North Africa Region regarding changes in the climate of the areas where they live? To what extent are households affected by extreme weather events such as droughts or floods? And who tends to suffer the most from such events when they occur? This chapter suggests answers to these questions on the basis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. The household surveys were implemented in two climate affected areas in each country. Overall, households in these areas do perceive important changes in the climate, for example with droughts becoming more frequent. While many households declare being affected by extreme weather events, with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment, this is especially the case of the poor who appear to suffer the most from extreme weather events.

Introduction
Climate change is expected to result in an increase in global temperatures by 3°C to 5°C in this century, as well as in a reduction in rainfall and greater seasonal temperature and rainfall variability in many areas. Higher sea levels are also a threat to many areas, including in the MENA region where a large share of its population is located in low lying areas. With agriculture remaining essential for livelihood in the region, and existing conditions in terms of water s carcity being already precarious in many areas, climate change represents a significant concern for households (Verner 2012; see also World Bank 2010 and Foresight 2011). Expectations are that extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent, which has implications for coping and adaptation mechanisms, as well as internal and international migration (for example, UNDP 2009; World Bank 2010; Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009). For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. (2014) and chapter

2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al. (2014a), both in this study.
This chapter focuses on household perceptions regarding climate change, the impact of extreme weather events, and the ways through which households cope with such events. More specifically, the chapter looks at four main questions: (1) What are the perceptions of households in the Middle East and North Africa Region regarding changes in the climate of the areas where they live?; (2) To what extent are households affected by extreme weather events such as droughts or floods and who tends to suffer the most from such events when they occur?; and (3) How do households cope with extreme weather events? The chapter suggests answers to these questions on the basis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen (see Burger et al. 2014a, 2014b). The household surveys were implemented in two climate affected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context. The survey took approximately two hours to administer and it was designed to elicit household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, self-assessed economic loss, and coping strategies, among others.
Overall, households do perceive important negative changes in the climate, for example with droughts becoming more frequent, or rainfall more erratic. While many households declare being affected by extreme weather events, with resulting losses in income, crops, livestock, or fish catchment, this is especially the case of the poor who appear to suffer the most. As far as coping mechanisms are concerned, again the poor ten do have fewer options than better off households. While none of the findings are unexpected, they do confirm that the poor tend to be most affected by extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change, while they also have fewer means to cope with such events. It must however be emphasized that the household survey results are not meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country. It must also be recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate short-term versus long-term household responses. This is especially the case when working with cross-sectional household surveys given that shorter-term events may be consistent with, but need not necessarily be reflective of longer-term climate change.
These caveats being stated, the chapter is organized as follows. Section two introduces the data used for the analysis. Section three discusses household perceptions about climate change and extreme weather events. Section four provides evidence on the impact of changes in weather patterns and the environment. A brief conclusion follows.

instrument was used in all countries with minor adjustments for country context. In each country, 800 households were interviewed. The survey questionnaire was designed by a World Bank team, and the surveys were implemented in the five countries by Rand in collaboration with local partners.
In Algeria, the survey was implemented in the prefectures of Djelfa and M'sila. Djelfa is in the north-central part of Algeria, while M'Sila is in the northern part. The sites were selected based on reported high sensitivity to desertification and with input from the Algerian government. For example, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and National Center for Spatial Techniques, 62 percent of M'Sila province is classified as ""sensitive"" or ""very sensitive"" to desertification. The sample size of 800 families was equally split across the two prefectures.
In Egypt, we selected two Governorates: Dakhalia and Sharqia. Dakhalia is north-east of Cairo, while Sharqia is in the northern part of the country. The total sample of 800 interviews was distributed equally across the two governorates. Within each governorate, the selection of villages was dictated by the Egyptian government authority that was approving the survey work (Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency). There were nine villages selected in Dakhalia, and 16 villages in Sharqia. A total of 400 interviews were conducted in each governorate.
In Morocco, two regions (Al-Gharb, Chichaoua) were selected based on the extent of environmental degradation due either recent disasters or longer-term processes. Within each region, 10 areas or strata were constructed across the entire region. We considered each area (town) selected as its own stratum, and the 10 strata to be overall representative of the region. There were 40 household interviews completed per stratum, under an equal allocation design.
In Syria we selected the governorates of Alhasaka in the northeast and Deir Ezzor in the east. Within Alhasaka, six areas/provinces and 20 villages were selected from two of the four districts. Some areas in Alhasaka were not eligible for inclusion due to safety concerns, no relevant climate/weather impacts, and language issues for areas that bordered Iraq. In Deir Ezzor, 10 areas/provinces and 16 villages were selected. These areas/provinces represented all three districts in Deir Ezzor. Interviews were divided equally between the two governorates.
In the Republic of Yemen, we selected the governorates of Taiz in the south and Hudayda in the western region. The governorates were chosen because of their exposure to environmental degradation and high rates of migration due to environmental reasons. The sample of 800 interviews was allocated according to population size (58 percent in Taiz and 42 percent in Hudayda. The interviews were completed in 15 villages within Taiz and 11 villages within Hudayda.
The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections. This chapter focuses on part of the data collected in section five on perceptions related to extreme weather events and climate change, and in section eight on adverse events. Specifically, the analysis focuses on household answers to four questions (data from the other sections are used for the regression analysis).
First, households were first asked: ""Compared to 5 years ago, have you noticed any changes in the weather patterns in the following way?"" For each of a dozen types of potential changes in weather patterns, households could answer ""yes,""

""no,"" or ""don't know"" (two additional codes capture refusal to respond or feedback from the households that the condition is not applicable, but these cases were rare). The potential changes in weather patterns identified in the questionnaire were: ""Rainfall is more erratic; Less rain; More rain; More frequent drought; More frequent floods; More frequent rain storms; More frequent sand storms; Rainy season is shorter; The start of the rainy season is later; The end of the rainy season is earlier; The temperature is hotter; and finally The temperature is colder.""
Second, households were asked: ""Compared to 5 years ago, have you noticed any of the following changes in the environment?"" Again for each of a dozen options, households could answer ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know."" The types of changes in the environment listed were: ""Deforestation and less trees; More frequent livestock loss; More frequent crop failure; Less fish in rivers, lakes or sea; More air pollution; More water pollution in rivers, lakes, sea or streams; Less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams; Land is dryer; Less fertile land; More soil erosion; More insects and pests in crops; More diseases in animals and livestock; Towns and urban areas are more crowded; People have migrated out to other places."" Note that the last two types of changes in the environment result from human responses through migration to changes in weather patterns and the environment. While migration itself may bring changes in the environment, those last two changes will not be included in the analysis of this chapter, which focuses more directly on changes in weather patterns and how they affect households.
The third important question in the section of the questionnaire in climate change used in this chapter relates to the impact of weather and environmental patterns. Specifically, households were asked the following question: ""In the past 5 years, have you or your household experienced the following events as a result of weather and environmental patterns?"" As before, households could respond ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know"", this time for four different types of losses: ""Loss of crops; Loss of income; Loss of livestock or cattle; and Less fish caught.""
Finally, in section eight of the questionnaire, households were asked the following question: ""I am now going to read a list of adverse events that may have occurred over the last 5 years. By shocks, I mean severe weather that has affected your household's welfare. Thinking of adverse events over the last 5 years that have had an impact on your household, please tell me which one adverse event impacted your household the most?"" The potential answers for that question were the following: ""Drought; Flood; Storms; Mudslides; Excessive heat; Excessive rain; Pest infestation; and Crops and livestock diseases."" Given these four questions, the objective of the chapter is very simple: it is to document household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and their environment as well as adverse events, and whether these changes and events lead to various types of losses for households, depending on the households' characteristics.

Perceptions of Climate Change Do households believe that changes in weather patterns and their environment are taking place in the five countries? Before answering that question, it is
important to mention a caveat to the analysis. Perceptions of changes in weather patterns need not mean that weather patterns are actually changing or that climate change is actually occurring. In addition, while the questions were asked over the last five years, it could be that household responses reflect perceptions that have matured over a longer period of time. The reason why the questions were asked about the last five years is that household recall of weather patterns is likely to be more accurate over that period than over longer periods of time. As to the reliance on data on perceptions, even if they may not always reflect reality very well (the issue of recall adds to that), they are still an important entry point in trying to understand how changes in weather patterns of the environment affect household livelihoods, and how households respond to such events. In fact, at least to some extent, one might argue that decisions on how to cope with and adapt to changes in weather patterns and the environment may be influenced as much by how households and individuals perceive those changes than by the events themselves. Thus the information is valuable.
Household perceptions about changes in weather patterns and the environment have been ranked in table 4.1 according to the share of households sharing these perceptions (that is, answering ""yes"") in the five-country sample. More than three fourths of households in the combined sample (77.5 percent) declare that rain has become more erratic, and almost three quarters (72.4 percent) declares that temperatures have increased. Between half and two thirds of households declare that there is less rain today than five years ago, that the land is dryer or less fertile, that the rainy season starts later, is shorter, or ends earlier, and that droughts are more frequent. Households also believe that the diseases are increasing for animals and livestock, that there are more insects and pets in crops, less water in boreholes, rivers, lakes or streams, more air pollution, more frequent crop failures and livestock loss, and more soil erosion.
A few of the extreme weather events often associated with climate change, such as rain storms and floods, are however not perceived as more frequent by a majority of households, but even for those events, almost half of respondents mention that they have increased in frequency (these events tend to be more localized, so it is to be expected that a smaller share of the sample would report them, which does not necessarily mean that they are less frequent). Some households do suggest that temperatures are becoming cooler (this is the case for almost half of the sample), and that there is actually more rain, but this is often the case only for a minority of households, and the overall picture that emerges is that of negative perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment, generally toward a dryer climate.
Basic statistics are also provided in table 4.1 on perceptions by country, and according to the welfare level of households. The welfare quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of data on consumption. The quintiles are based on an index of wealth estimated through factorial analysis, as often done in the absence of good data on consumption. There are clear differences between countries in perceptions, as expected. In Syria, virtually all households declare that most of the changed in weather patterns
and in the environment are occurring. In Egypt by contrast, none of the changes is reported by a majority of households, with the most frequent change reported being that of rain being more erratic by 43.6 percent of households. The other three countries fall somewhere in between, with some changes reported more in some countries and others in others. Of course, these data are not representative of the countries as a whole, but only of the two areas sampled in each of the countries. Still, there is clear evidence that in most areas--with the exception of Egypt, households do perceive negative changes in weather patterns and the environment to take place. By contrast, differences in perceptions by quintiles of well-being are smaller, also as expected, given that within areas all households should broadly notice the same changes in climate and the environment, even if the impact of these changes may not be the same for all households.
While table 4.1 provides detailed data on various dimensions of autonomy identified in the screening card, it is also useful to come up with summary measures or indices of autonomy. These are obtained through multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), a technique used for analyzing the relationship between variables taking categorical values. This type of analysis is often used to uncover the main underlying factors that capture the variance in a data set, typically with visualization along two or three dimensions. Here, we are using the techniques to obtain aggregate indices of the changes in perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment. By construction the indices constructed through the MCA are defined in such a way that they explain a share of the variance in the underlying variables as large possible. In implementing the MCA, we relied on the subset of variables related to the perceptions of weather patterns and the environment for which at least 5 percent of the sample responded in the affirmative, so as to reduce potential noise in the data. Given that for most changes in weather patterns and the environment more than 5 percent of household declare that these changes are actually occurring, this procedure does not affect the results too much.
The results for the first two factors of the MCA are presented in tables 4.2 and 4.3. In each table, the original variables are ranked according to their contribution to each of the two factors, by descending order of contribution. For example in table 4.2 the three variables contributing the most to the first factor are ""Land is dryer-No"" and ""Less Fertile Land ­No"", and ""Rainy season starts laterNo"". By contrast, in table 4.3, the variables contributing the most to the second factor are ""More Rain-Yes"", ""More frequent floods-Yes,"" and More frequent rainstorms-Yes"". The first factor explains a very large share (88.3 percent) of the inertia or variance in the data included in the MCA, with the second factor explaining an additional 6.0 percent of the inertia. Given that these two factors explain most of the inertia in the original variables, we will use only these two factors in the subsequent analysis.
Consider first table 4.2. In order to understand intuitively what the first factor represents, it is necessary to look at both the contribution of each variable and modality to the factor, and the sign and value of the coordinates for the variables. The first 12 largest contributors are all indicators of good climatic conditions in that there is no deterioration in these variables--land is not dryer nor is it less
fertile; the rainy season does not start later, nor is it shorter; droughts are not more frequent, and insects and pests in crops are not increasing, and so on. The coordinates for all those variables are positive, so that when these modalities are observed in the data, the first factor takes on a larger value. The next set of contributors include many variables that take a positive value--yes, there is more soil erosion and livestock losses, as well as more insects and pests in crops. There is also less water in boreholes, the rain is more erratic, the land is less fertile, droughts are more frequent, and so on. For these modalities, the coordinates are negative, suggesting that these modalities reduce the value assigned to the first factor. Overall, a higher value for the first factor thus suggests good weather conditions especially in terms of rainfall and its implications for land fertility, while a lower value suggests that negative structural changes are occurring, with less rain, more droughts, and thereby poorer agricultural conditions.
Consider next table 4.3. The variables and modalities with the largest contributions to that factor are very different. More rain as well as more frequent floods and rainstorms are the first three contributors, and they have positive coordinates. Negative answers to questions about the frequency of rainstorms and floods as well as the amount of rain are also important contributors, but with negative coordinates. This second factor seems to capture the presence of excess water, especially through floods and rainstorms, which tend to be sudden events, as opposed to more structural conditions. While a larger positive value for the first factor denotes good conditions, a larger positive value for the second factor is associated with excess water, which is a negative.
In order to facilitate the interpretation of the econometric analysis in section four, we will use the two factors of the MCA, but with two transformations. First, we will consider the negative value of the first factor as our first summary climate variable. This means that a larger positive value for the first factor will denote worse structural conditions in terms of climate (higher temperatures, reduced land fertility, more droughts and erratic rainfall, and so on). With that first transformation, larger positive values for both factors will denote worsening climate and environmental conditions. Second, we will normalize the two factors so that they both take a value between zero and one (this is done by redefining each factor as its value minus the minimum value, and dividing the result by the difference between the maximum and minimum values). Thus, a value close to zero will imply that the conditions are among the best in the sample, while a value close to one will denote some of the worst conditions in the sample. For ease of interpretation, and even though this does not capture all of what the two factors represent, we will denote the two factors as respectively ""Dryer/Warmer Weather"" and ""Excess Rain."" The question will be whether these two factors are closely associated with losses for households.

excessive heat on the one hand and floods on the other hand--are closely related to the two factors that were obtained from the MCA in the previous section, although the MCA factors tend to capture a broader range of phenomena, including some of the consequences of changes in weather patterns, for example in terms of land fertility. Note that there are differences between countries in table 4.4. In Syria, all households declare having been affected by droughts, which are also considered as the most damaging adverse event. In Morocco by contrast, floods were the main adverse event affecting households. There are also some differences between households according to their quintile of wealth, but these are less pronounced. For example, the data suggest that households in the poorer quintiles are more likely to identify the adverse events that affected them the most, probably because they are more vulnerable to such events.
The fact that the poor are more likely to suffer from changes in weather patterns and the environment is confirmed by households' responses to the other question about the effect of these changes on them. As mentioned in section two, households were asked whether in the last five years they suffered from lost income, lost crops, lost livestock or cattle, or less fish caught as a result of weather and environment patterns (the surveys do not provide data on the magnitude of the losses; they only inform us as to whether losses occurred). Table 4.5 summarizes the responses. More than half of all respondents said that changes in weather patterns and the environment led to a loss of crops, and more than a third reported a loss of income. About a fourth reported a loss of livestock or cattle, and 8.6 percent said that they caught less fish (this would be observed only for those households whose livelihood depend on fishing). The results differ again between the countries, with especially high frequencies of losses of crops in Syria (remember that virtually all households in the areas surveyed reported suffering from a drought), and lower frequencies in Egypt. Yet as expected, households belonging to lower quintiles of well-being were more likely than better-off households to declare having suffered from the various types of losses.

Do these results on the differentiated impact of adverse weather events on households depending on their welfare level still hold when conducting multiple regression analysis? The answer to this question is provided in table 4.6 which displays the results of standard probit regressions on whether households declare having lost income, crops, livestock/cattle, or caught less fish. The marginal effects estimated at the mean of the sample are displayed, and the levels of statistical significance are based on robust standard errors. Many of the variables included in the regression have statistically significant impacts on the probability of losses. There are differences between countries in the likelihood of losses as well as the types of losses incurred, which is not surprising, given the differences in the local economies in the various areas. For example, losses in crops are most likely in the Republic of Yemen, which is also the country with the largest share of GDP accounted for by agriculture, while losses in income are most likely in Syria, which is the country in which more households reported adverse events.
As expected, the two climatic conditions factors have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of losses. The impacts are large. Recalling that the climatic factors are normalized to take a value between zero and one, going from the best conditions (value of zero) to the worst conditions (value of one) in the sample for the first factor related mostly to droughts as well as dryer and warmer weather increases the probability of losses by 42.4 percent for crops, 45.8 percent for income, 31.0 percent for livestock or cattle, and 10.8 percent for fishing. For the second factor, which is related mostly to floods and excess water, the impacts of going from best to worst conditions are of a similar order of magnitude, at 42.7 percent for crops (the same order of magnitude as that observed for the first factor), 27.6 percent for income, 34.3 percent for livestock or cattle, and 15.1 percent for fishing. Thus, even if the occurrence of adverse events and environmental conditions related to the first factor are more frequent than those related to the second factor, once those conditions come into play, both types of changes in weather patterns and environmental conditions have large negative effects on the livelihoods of households.
Also as expected, the probability of a loss is higher in many cases for poorer households. This is clear for crop and income losses, where in both cases households in the bottom three quintiles of wealth tend to have an increase in the probability of a loss of about 10 percentage points as compared to households in the top quintile of wealth. On the other hand, losses in livestock and cattle as well as in fishing are highest in the fourth quintile of well-being, possibly because those households are more likely to be involved in these activities which tend to require more assets, while households in the top quintile tend not to be working much in agriculture. It could of course be that part of the relationship between welfare levels and losses associated with adverse weather events is due to an endogeneity issue, in that the lower level of wealth observed for the households who suffered from a loss may reflect the loss itself. Yet because of the way the questions are asked over a five-year period, and because welfare is measured through assets as opposed to income, it is likely that the correlations also reflect
simply a higher propensity of low-income households to be more exposed to such losses due to their occupations.
The relationship between occupation and losses actually comes out strongly as well in the regression. First, households who own land (and probably cultivate it), and to some extent households who are land tenants, both tend to have a higher probability of losses related to adverse weather events. A similar pattern is observed in terms of the types of occupation of the household head, with the highest marginal impact on the likelihood of losses for crops and incomes observed among the self-employed in agriculture, in comparison to the reference category of the salaried. Those households who have better jobs as salaried worker, as well as households whose heads have higher levels of education, tend to be the least likely to suffer from crop, income, livestock/cattle, or fishing losses related to adverse weather events.
All of these results make sense, and the regressions simply display basic facts that are somewhat obvious--namely that households that tend to be poorer as well as those who rely on agriculture and livestock as well as fishing for their livelihoods are the most exposed to losses related to changes in weather patterns and environmental conditions. The other variables in the regressions--such as the household size and the gender of the household head, do not have statistically significant impacts on the likelihood of losses. But two more variables display statistically significant correlations. First, in several instances households with younger household heads tend to be less affected by adverse weather shocks, perhaps because they tend to be less employed in traditional agricultural activities than households with older heads, with these effects being only partially controlled for in the regression through the other independent variables. At the same time however, those who are single are more likely to suffer an income or livestock loss, perhaps at least in the first case because they are also more likely to be involved in casual labor that is less required when crops are destroyed by droughts or floods.

Conclusion
The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, as well as extreme weather events and their impact on households in the MENA region. The analysis was based on household surveys implemented in five countries, with a focus in each country on two areas more susceptible to be affected by adverse weather shocks. The data suggest that a substantial majority of households do perceive important changes in the climate and their environment. Some of the most commonly reported changes include more erratic rain, higher temperatures, less rain, dryer and less fertile land, and more frequent droughts. In some areas by contrast, excess rain is the issue, especially when it leads to floods. As expected, these household perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment are strongly correlated with the likelihood that households declare having suffered from various types of losses in livelihood due to adverse climatic events.

Also as expected, the data suggest that households involved in agriculture, and especially the poor as measured through indices of wealth, are most likely to suffer from losses in crops and income, the two most frequently cited types of losses associated with adverse weather events. By contrast, households who tend to be more protected through a better education and salaried employment are much less likely to suffer from the negative effects of perceived climate change and adverse weather shocks. While none of those results are in themselves surprising, they help to set the stage for subsequent chapters devoted to an analysis of how households cope with these changes, first through migration, and then through other coping and adaptation mechanisms.

CHAPTER 5
Weather Shocks, Impacts, and Households' Ability to Recover in Morocco
Minh Cong Nguyen and Quentin Wodon

What is the likelihood that Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, may be confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts and floods? Who suffers the most from such events when they occur? To what extent are different types of households able to recover from such shocks? This chapter provides answers to these questions on the basis of questions on weather shocks added to a nationally representative household survey implemented in Morocco in 2009­10. The data suggest that most households working in agriculture are affected by weather shocks, often seriously. In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected is about one fourth. A majority of households declare not being able to recover much from weather shocks, as well as other shocks. But in comparison to other shocks, including unexpected increases in the prices of food and other basic essential commodities, households are slightly more likely to be able to recover from weather shocks.

Introduction
Climate change is expected to result in an increase in global temperatures by 3°C to 5°C in this century, as well as in a reduction in rainfall and greater seasonal temperature and rainfall variability in many areas. Higher sea levels are also a threat to many areas, including in the MENA region where a large share of its population is located in low-lying areas. With agriculture remaining essential for livelihood in the region, and existing conditions in terms of water scarcity being already precarious in many areas, climate change represents a significant concern for households. Expectations are that extreme weather events such as floods and droughts are likely to become more frequent, which has implications for coping and adaptation mechanisms (for example, Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; UNDP 2009; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009; Verner 2012; World Bank 2010). For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction

of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al. (2014a), both in this study.
In the case of Morocco, periodic droughts have now become the norm rather than the exception. These droughts tend to have substantial effects on households involved in agriculture in part because irrigated land is rare (Skees 2001; Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000). The evidence points to a decrease in rainfall of up to 25 percent and an increase in the frequency of droughts over the last three decades, which in turn has led to an increase in the volatility of the contribution of agriculture to GDP (Azzam and Sekkat 2005; Barakat and Handoufe 1998; Skees 2001). While farmers have developed new ways to cope with droughts and the share of households relying primarily or solely on agriculture for their livelihood has decreased (Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000), many households remain engaged in agriculture and highly vulnerable to droughts, especially among the rural poor.
This chapter provides a new assessment of the extent to which households are subject to extreme weather shocks in Morocco, who suffers the most from these shocks, and whether households are able to recover from the shocks. The analysis is based primarily on perceptions, with households assessing subjectively the extent to which they are affected by weather shocks as well as their ability to recover from these shocks. The data come from a recent nationally representative household survey data collected in Morocco in 2009/10. The main objective of the survey was to collect data on youth employment and civic engagement, but questions were added to the survey for this study on climate change both to assess to what extent households were affected by extreme weather events and to be able to compare their ability to recover from those shocks as opposed to other shocks.
The data suggest that virtually all households working in agriculture are affected by weather shocks, often seriously. In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected by weather shocks is about one fourth, simply because this is also roughly the proportion of those involved in agriculture, with other households less likely to be affected. A majority of households declare not being able to recover much from weather shocks, as well as a range of other shocks, and this is especially the case for poorer households. But in comparison to other shocks, including unexpected increases in the prices of food and other basic essential commodities, households are slightly more likely to be able to recover from weather shocks.
These findings confirm, as was already observed in the analysis of chapter 4 (Adoho and Wodon, 2014), that the poor tend to be most affected by extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent with climate change, while they also have fewer means to cope with such events or recover from them. The chapter is organized as follows. Section two introduces the data used for the analysis. Section three provides basic statistics on the extent to which households are affected by weather and other shocks, and whether they are able to recover from the shocks. Section four provides a multivariate analysis of the correlates of both the likelihood of being affected by various shocks, and the ability to recover. A brief conclusion follows.
Data
This chapter is based on data from the Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented in 2009/10. The survey is nationally representative (even if it does not include the scarcely populated Western Sahara southern part of the country) and includes data on 2,000 households (1,216 in urban areas and 784 in rural areas). The survey was implemented with funding from the World Bank between December 2009 and March 2010. Much of the questionnaire focused on issues critical to youth, and especially the obstacles that they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation. Questions were also asked about young people's intentions to emigrate. Other more traditional modules deal with standard questions on household member demographics and education as well as employment information. The questionnaire also focused on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks. In order to be able to use the survey also for this work on migration in the MENA region, additional questions as well as options within existing questions were asked at the design stage of the survey on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions. While the survey also included a separate instrument administered to most young individuals in the surveyed households, that part of the survey is not used here.
Apart from a range of household and individual characteristics which are used as controls in the regression analysis, a few central questions are used for the analysis presented in this chapter. In section 6B of the questionnaire devoted to climate change and shocks in agriculture, households are asked the following question: ""Is one of the members of household involved in agriculture or agriculture related activities?"" For those households involved in agriculture, the following question was then asked: ""Over the last five years has your household faced the following problems?"" The list of problems identified was as follows: (1) Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (periodic and recurrent water scarcity due to droughts); (2) Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (too much rain or flooding); (3) Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields; (4) Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (that is too hot, too cold, too rainy, too dry); (5) Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields; (6) Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector; (7) Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions; (8) Reduction in the stock of livestock since the availability of grazing land is becoming less due to droughts and floods. Next households were asked: ""How serious was the financial loss to the household due to these climate related factors listed above?"" The potential answers were very serious, moderate, serious, and negligible. Finally households were asked ""Was (the household) forced to change the economic activity after the shock?""
In section 6A about the incidence of shocks and household responses, households are asked whether since November 2004, the respondent or a member of the household experienced various shocks. The shocks listed are as follows: (1) Weather shocks (droughts; floods; pest infestation, crop and livestock diseases); (2) Unexpected increase in prices of food or other essential commodities
consumed; (3) Unexpected loss of job; (4) Involuntary reduction in employment or the number of hours worked; (5) Unexpected decline in prices or demand for products that you sell; (6) Unexpected increase in prices or shortages of inputs or products needed for your activity; (7) Loss of asset or of livestock due to theft, death, or accident; (8) Cut-off or decrease in remittances to household; (9) Death of main earner for the household; (10) Death of another member of the family; (11) Serious injury or illness that kept any member from doing normal activities; (12) Divorce or abandonment by husband; (13) Big amount of dowry for daughter's marriage; (14) Other (specify). For every shock that they were faced with, households are then asked ""Have you managed to recovered from the negative consequences of this shock?"" The possible answers were not at all, not much but some, much but not completely, or completely.

Basic Statistics
Information on the share of households involved in agriculture and affected by various climate and weather shocks is provided in table 5.1. The data are provided by type of shock, and information is also reported on the share of households that have been affected by at least one of the shocks in the last five years in the sample of households involved in agriculture, as well as in the overall sample of households. Table 5.1 suggests that 28.1 percent of households are involved in agriculture, with the proportion being as expected much higher in rural areas and in the lower wealth quintiles of the population (following standard practice, wealth quintiles were obtained using factorial analysis on a range of assets owned by households as well as dwelling characteristics). For example, in the bottom quintile of wealth, 70.7 percent of households have at least one member involved in agriculture. Among those involved in agriculture, an overwhelming majority declares having been affected by at least one climate-related shock. That proportion is at 92.1 percent, and does not vary too much according to the quintile of well-being of the household, although it is lower in the top quintile in comparison with other quintiles.
The most likely shock is a reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (62.2 percent of households) followed by reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector (43.9 percent), a reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (38.2 percent), and changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (34.5 percent). Other shocks affect less than a third of those involved in agriculture, but are still significant. Among those involved in agriculture, there are few differences between quintiles in terms of the likelihood to be affected by specific shocks. However, in the population as a whole, the likelihood of being affected by climate-related shocks is much higher in the bottom quintiles simply because the share of the population in those quintiles involved in agriculture is much higher, as already mentioned. For example the proportion of those affected by the various shocks listed in table 5.1 is at 65.8 in the bottom quintile nationally, versus 5.3 percent in the top quintile. As to the seriousness of the shocks, it is also similar across quintiles, or at least
questions in that those involved in agriculture declaring being affected by the climate shocks are also in many cases those mentioning being affected by a weather shock in the other part of the questionnaire. The fact that the two questions yield similar results is reassuring about the ability of the survey to identify those affected by climate shocks.
The third largest type of shock in terms of the share of the households affected is the unexpected loss of job (14.3 percent), followed closely by a reduction in employment or hours worked (13.5 percent). The other shocks (serious injury/illness preventing work, shortage of inputs or increase in input prices, loss of assets or livestock, decline in prices or in the demand for sales, death of another family member, or death of the main income earner in the household) tend to affect a smaller of households. For all 10 shocks identified in the survey, the likelihood of being affected is higher in the bottom quintile as compared to the top quintile, but the differential is especially large for weather shocks, as well as the loss of assets or livestock. This is again related to the fact that the poor are much
more likely to make a living in agriculture and livestock, and are therefore much more likely to be affected by extreme weather events.
What about the ability of households to recover from shocks? This ability seems to be limited for most shocks. About half of households declare that they were not able at all to recover from most shocks, including the increase in food/ other prices, unexpected job losses, a reduction in employment or hours worked, a serious injury or illness preventing work, a shortage of inputs/increase in prices, or a loss of asset/livestock. The share of those not able to recover is slightly lower at about 40 percent for weather shocks as well as for a decline in prices/demand for sales and the death of other family member, but it is much higher for the death of the main income earner in the household, at 70.4 percent. The share of those declaring being able to achieve some, but not a substantial recovery, is also high, so that only a relatively small minority of households declare being able to recover from the shocks substantially or fully. In many cases, but not in all cases, poorer households tend to be less able to recover from various shocks than wealthier households, and this is especially the case of weather shocks. Thus, not only are poor households more likely to be affected by weather shocks due to their involvement in agriculture, but in addition they are also less likely to be able to recover from those shocks when they occur.

Correlates of the Likelihood of Shocks and the Ability to Recover
This section provides a more detailed analysis of the likelihood of being affected by various shocks and the ability to recover in a multivariate setting using regression analysis. The analysis is still descriptive, but it permits for example to assess whether some types of households, say by quintile of wealth, are more likely to be affected by shocks, or less likely to be able to recover when affected, controlling for other factors such as their geographic location.
Table 5.3 provides the results of simple probit regressions (with robust standard errors) for the correlates of the probability of being affected by the main types of shocks (for shocks affecting very few households, the regression analysis was not implemented). Consider first the coefficient estimates for the level of well-being of households by quintiles of wealth. There is clear evidence that poorer households tend to be more affected by many of the shocks than better-off households. In some cases, the coefficients are statistically significant only for the top quintile (the reference category being the bottom and poorest quintile), which suggests that only the wealthiest households are comparatively more protected than other households. But in other cases there is a clear gradation in risk. This is the case for weather shocks, where the coefficients estimates are statistically significant for three of the four quintiles of wealth, and monotically decreasing as wealth increases. Households in the top quintile are 13.1 percentage points less likely to be affected by weather shocks that households in the bottom quintile controlling for other factors, and this decreases to 11.4 points for the fourth quintile, 7.1 point for the third quintile, and 3.0 points for the second quintile, although that last coefficient is not statistically significant. Similar monotonic or
quasi-monotonic gradation patterns are observed for a few of the other shocks (even though coefficients may not always be statistically significant) including especially job losses and less hours worked, as well as serious illnesses or injuries.
A number of other statistically significant coefficients are interesting. As expected, when households own more than one acre of land, which is the case mostly for households involved in agriculture, or when the household head is involved in agriculture, they tend to be much more likely to be affected by weather shocks. The effects are not only statistically significant, but also large, at 21.2 percentage points for landownership, and at an additional 8.3 percentage points for a household head working in agriculture as compared to salaried work. By contrast, households with substantial land are less likely to be affected by unexpected increases in food prices or other essential commodities, simply because many of these households tend to be net producers of food, so that they may actually benefit from increases in food prices. Note however that households with a head involved in agriculture are more likely to be affected by the increase in food prices than the reference category of salaried work--so not all households in rural areas are protected from such food price increases. Households with land and those with a head involved in agriculture are both less likely to be affected by job losses, suggesting the protective effect of selfemployed for this type of shock. But households with land are more likely to be affected by an increase in input prices and by losses of assets and livestock. A few other effects related to the occupation of the head are at work, including differences in the probability to lose work.
Urban households are less likely to be affected by weather shocks than rural households, but also somewhat surprisingly less likely to be affected by unexpected increases in the price of food, perhaps because they tend to be better of (even if this is partially controlled by the assets quintiles). Urban households are more likely to be affected by the death of the main income earner in the household, perhaps because they tend to be smaller and thereby without other income sources. Larger households tend to be more affected by most shocks, which reflects the fact they live in areas more affected by weather shocks and that with more household members, the probability that at least one of them will suffer from a negative shock is simply higher. Female-headed households are also more likely to be affected by several of the shocks; also this is compensated in part by the coefficient for the female adult ratio. Households with older heads are less affected by several of the shocks, possibly because of a higher rate of self-employment when working, but they are more affected by the possibility of the death of the main earner, as expected. In general, a higher level of education for the household head is associated with a lower risk of being affected by shocks--this is mainly the case for weather shocks (since households with better educated heads work less in agriculture) and job losses or losses in hours worked (since individuals in households with better educated heads tend to have more secure and stable jobs), but there are a few cases when education is positively correlated with shocks.
In a few cases the likelihood of shocks is related to geographic location after controlling for household characteristics. The reference geographic location in the regression model is the prefecture of Tanger-Tétouhan, which is located in the tip of the northern part of the country towards Spain. In the case of weather shocks, in comparison to that region, only one region has a statistically significant and higher likelihood of shocks (the region of Méknès-Tafilalet, located in the north-east part of the country, bordering Algeria), while two regions have a lower probability of weather shocks (the regions of Oriental, located just north of Méknès-Tafilalet, and Rabat-Salé-Zemmour-Zaér, located to the west of RabatSalé-Zemmour-Zaér). All other geographic effects are not statistically significant, even though they are all positive. It should not be inferred from these results that the likelihood of weather shocks is uniform across areas, but simply that the household survey data do not generate very marked profiles of weather shocks by area at the level of regions. Of course, the fact that the household survey sample is limited in each of the regions (there are 14 regions included in the survey, and 2000 household, so that on average less than 150 households are included in the sample for each region) also contributes to the lack of statistical significance of the effects. In a nutshell, while it is important to include geographic in the regression analysis, not too much should be inferred from the coefficient estimates for these controls. But the results displayed according to household characteristics, and especially the vulnerability of poorer households to weather and other shocks, are important.
What about the ability to recover from the shocks? A probit regression analysis is provided in table 5.4, where for the sake of simplification, a household was considered as being able to recover from a shock if the household declared that it had recovered very much or completely (the results are not qualitatively different when estimating an ordered probit or logit). All households who declare having been affected by a shock are included in the analysis, and when a household has been affected by more than one shock, the different shocks are taken into account. The fact of combining all types of shocks in the analysis enables us to use the data in a richer way, including by comparing whether it is more or less difficult for households to recover from different types of shocks (by contrast, if the analysis were conducted for each type of shock separately, for many shocks the sample size would be too small to uncover meaningful results). Two different models are estimated, with the addition in the second model of the leave-out-mean share of households declaring having been affected by a shock in a given area.
Again, a very clear pattern emerges in table 5.4 by quintile of wealth, with richer households much more likely to be able to recover from shocks. Households in the top quintile are approximately 20 percentage points more likely to recover from a shock than households in the bottom quintile, and for the fourth quintile, the gain is at about 11 percentage points versus the bottom quintile. A better education is also associated with a higher likelihood of recovering, although the effect is statistically significant only for the collège level (which means lower secondary education and not higher education as is the case in the United States). Households involved in nonagricultural work are also more likely
to recover from shocks, as are households with older heads (taking into account quadratic effects). Geographic effects are for the most part not statistically significant. But what is important is the fact that as compared to the excluded category of shocks, which is the unexpected increase in food or other essential commodity prices, the ability of households to recover from a weather shock is actually higher by six to seven percentage points depending on the specification, and not lower (the coefficients for the other shocks are not statistically significant, but this may be because for some of the shocks the sample is small). The fact that the ability to recover from shocks was slightly higher for weather shocks than for the rise in food and other prices was already apparent in the basic statistics in table 5.2, but this is simply confirmed in the regression analysis after introducing a number of controls. While this does not mean that the effect of weather shocks is small, it means that other shocks--in this case the increase in food and other prices--may be even more devastating.

Conclusion
What is the likelihood that Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, may be confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts and floods? Who suffers the most from such events when they occur? To what extent are different types of households able to recover from such shocks? This chapter provides answers to these questions on the basis of questions on weather shocks added to a nationally representative household survey implemented in Morocco in 2009/10. The data suggest that most households working in agriculture are affected by weather shocks, often seriously. In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected is about one fourth. A majority of households declare not being able to recover much from weather shocks, as well as other shocks. But in comparison to other shocks, including unexpected increases in the prices of food and other basic essential commodities, households are slightly more likely to be able to recover from weather shocks.

How Do Households Cope with and Adapt to Climate Change?
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

What are the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies (apart from migration, which is discussed in part 3 of the study) that households use in order to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions? Are households forced to sell assets or take other emergency measures in cases of losses due to extreme weather events? Beyond short-term emergency responses, are they taking measures to adapt to changing conditions? This chapter, which as was the case for chapter 4 is based on new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen, documents the coping and adaptation strategies of households as well as government and community responses to changes in weather patterns and the environment. Overall, the results suggest that coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with shocks are diverse, but still limited, as are the community and government responses that could help them.

Introduction

As already mentioned in previous chapters, weather and environmental conditions in many areas of the MENA region have worsened in the recent past and are expected to worsen further in the future. This is likely to lead to substantial increases in temperature, reductions in rainfall, and a higher likelihood of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods (Elasha 2010; IPCC 2012; McSweeney, New, and Lizcano 2009; UNDP 2009; Verner 2012; World Bank 2010). These trends will exacerbate water scarcity issues and threaten agricultural sectors which remain essential for the livelihood of a substantial share of the population in many countries, and especially in some of the countries analyzed in this study (for a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. [2014] and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al. [2014a] in this study).
In chapter 4 of the study, an analysis of new household survey data collected in 2011 in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen suggested
that households living in areas exposed to weather shocks indeed do perceive a change in weather patterns and in their environment. Furthermore, a large majority of households declare having lost income, crops, livestock or cattle, or fish due to adverse weather events and changing environmental conditions over the five years preceding the surveys. It was also shown that the poor have paid the highest price in terms of a higher likelihood of losses for the changes that are taking place in the climate.
This chapter is based on the same data as that used in chapter 4 (on the data and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al. 2014a, 2014b), but the focus shifts to a discussion of the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by the households when affected by adverse weather events or changes in their environment. Both the households who declare having been affected by weather shocks and suffered losses and the population as a whole living in the areas where the surveys where implemented are considered. Apart from looking at household specific coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, data are also provided as to whether communities are promoting adaptation strategies at the local level, and whether the government also provides support for adaptation, as well as for coping among others through the availability of social protection programs that could help households in need.
The structure of the chapter is as follows. Section two introduces the data used for the analysis, and especially the main questions in the surveys related to coping and adaptation. Sections three and four respectively discuss households coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies. Community and government responses are discussed in section five. A brief conclusion follows.

Data and Methodology
As in chapter 4, this chapter relies on data from five household surveys implemented in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen. In each country, 800 households were interviewed, typically in two main areas per country. A brief description of the areas where the surveys were implemented in each of the countries was provided in chapter 2. The survey questionnaire included a total of 17 sections. This chapter focuses on part of the data collected in section five on perceptions related to extreme weather events and climate change, and specifically on the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by households to cope with changing climatic conditions and adverse weather shocks. Data are also provided as to whether communities are promoting adaptation strategies, and whether the government also provides support to do so.
On coping, households who declared that they had experienced a loss of crops, income, livestock or fish due to weather shocks or changes in the environment were asked if they used the following coping strategies: (1) Selling or pawning livestock; (2) Selling or pawning assets other than livestock, such as land or jewelry; (3) Withdrawing children from school; (4) Using their savings; and finally (5) Asking for a loan. In addition, households who did not experience a loss linked to an adverse weather events were asked whether they would rely on
the same coping mechanisms in case they would experience such a loss. In that case, households could say that they strongly agree that they would use the coping mechanisms, that they somewhat agree, that they somewhat disagree, or that they strongly disagree. Statistics will be provided on the reliance on various coping mechanisms for both the households who did experience a loss and for the sample as a whole, including in that case the responses of households to the same question in the case of a hypothetical loss. In addition to the basic statistics, regression analysis will be provided for analyzing the extent to which households who actually experienced a loss (and for whom the information may be more reliable) have used the various coping mechanisms. For the regression analysis, a Heckman probit model is used with a first-stage probit regression on the probability of experiencing a loss, and a second-stage regression on whether households have relied on the specific coping strategy after the loss. The identification variable for the system is the leave-out-mean probability of experiencing a loss in the area where the household lives, with the area defined as the primary sampling unit of the household in the survey dataset.
On adaptation, households were asked whether they have taken specific actions to adapt to changing weather patterns following losses of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes. All households answered the question, not only those who declared having suffered losses. The following potential actions that could be taken by households were listed: (1) change in the timing of planting the main crop; (2) change in the source from which the water is drawn; (3) as compared to five years ago, longer time to gather or collect water; (4) collecting more firewood; (5) as compared to five years ago, longer time to collect firewood; (6) terracing the land; (7) drilling boreholes; (8) change in the production technologies used, such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; (9) change in the crop choices, increase in the crop variety, or adopting drought or flood resistant crops; (10) change in the percentage composition of crops versus. livestock; (11) increase in the use of fertilizer or pesticides; (12) seeking or increasing off-farm employment; (13) receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment; (14) using more stored water as compared to five years ago; (15) consuming more stored grains and stored animal products as compared to five years ago; (16) being aware of people moving out of the community as a result of weather or environmental changes; (17) in the last five years, having people moved into the community; (18) if people moved into the community, this leading to conflict in the community; (19) in the past five years, having personally experienced a conflict over agricultural land or livestock as a result of weather or environmental changes; and finally (20) in the last five years, having personally experienced a conflict over water for household use or cultivation as a result of weather or environmental changes. Simple probit regressions are estimated to look at the correlates of the probability that households use the various strategies.
On community-level responses, households were asked whether in order to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, their community had undertaken the following actions: (1) Planting trees or installing soil protection measures; (2) Building banks on rivers, streams
or small check banks to reduce flooding; (3) Developing new infrastructure such as boreholes, wells, irrigation, or roads; (4) Gathering and disseminating information on measures to reduce the loss of crops, income, or livestock; (6) Taking measures to prepare for future disasters like floods or droughts; (7) Taking action to improve market access for agricultural products or handicrafts,and so on; and finally (8) Taking action to purchase seeds, animals or farm equipment. The responses reflect the perception by households as to whether their community has adopted adaptation strategies. Because this provides only community-level information, only summary statistics are provided as opposed to a regression analysis on the correlates at the household level of these perceptions. Correlates of perceptions might be interesting to analyze, but given that many households in the same community will respond in similar way to the questions, the information provided by those correlates may not be that useful.
Finally, on government responses, households were asked whether in order to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the government had undertaken a number of actions. While some actions are similar to those mentioned in the question on community responses, others refer more to social protection programs. The list of options in the questionnaire was as follows: (1) Planting trees or installing soil protection measures?; (2) Building banks on rivers, streams, or small checking banks to reduce flooding; (3) Developing new infrastructure such as building boreholes and canals for irrigation or roads; (4) Providing seeds or fertilizer or fodder for livestock; (5) Providing storage facility for crops; (6) Providing cash or food for work; (7) Distributing cash for food during floods and droughts; (8) Providing drinking water; (9) Providing skills training programs; (10) Providing credit during crop loss; (11) Improving access to markets by providing transportation; and finally (11) Supporting prices when agricultural prices are low. Again, the responses reflect the perception by households as to whether their government has provided support, and not whether they personally have received support. For that reason, as for the community level responses, only summary statistics are provided in the analysis as opposed to regression analysis.
One more point requires a brief explanation regarding the way climatic conditions are treated in the analysis. The survey questionnaire includes a large number of variables on the perceptions of households regarding various changes in weather patterns and their environment. Instead of trying to assess individually the impact of each of those variables on coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies, we rely on two broader indices of household perceptions regarding climatic conditions that were constructed through a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). The approach used is discussed in chapter 4. What matters for the interpretation in this chapter is that the first factor mostly captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts and the lack of rain. The second factor mostly captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods. Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one, with one characterizing the worst conditions in the sample, and zero the best conditions.
asked whether they would use the various coping mechanism if they were affected by climate patterns in the future. Households who strongly or somewhat agreed that they would use the mechanisms were codified as likely to use it, and those who somewhat or strongly disagreed were classified as not likely to use the mechanism, so that the information could be dichotomized and compared with the response provided by those affected by shocks. In table 6.1, the share of households actually using or likely to use the various mechanisms as a proportion of the total population is provided first (the top part of the table factors in those not affected by shocks). The statistics only for the subsample of households actually affected by losses is provided next.
For the population as a whole, 60.6 percent of households declare that they have used or would use their savings in case of a climate shock. This is followed by 46.8 percent of respondents (typically household heads) who have sold or would sell their assets, 46.2 percent who have asked for a loan or would do so, 40.6 percent who have sold or would sell their livestock, and finally 36.4 percent who have withdrawn or would withdraw their children from school. This last result on the potential impact on schooling of weather shocks is surprising and would warrant further analysis before being taken at face value. The proportions of households resorting to these various strategies tend to be higher among lower quintiles (which have fewer other ways to cope), and they are also higher among households declaring that they lost income, crops, or livestock/cattle, or caught
less fish, as expected. There are differences between countries, especially regarding the possibility of withdrawing children from school--in Egypt this is not considered by most households. Also, households receiving international remittances, who tend to be better off, are less likely to resort to coping strategies, except using their savings.
The responses for the subsample of those actually declaring a loss are fairly similar, which is not surprising, given that a majority of household do declare losses, as documented in chapter 4. The main difference is that the reliance of households on the first four coping mechanisms is higher among those actually affected than among the sample as a whole, which could reflect the fact that an actual shock elicits more responses than a hypothetical one, but could also reflect the fact that the households actually affected tend to be poorer, which may require them to rely on such coping mechanisms more, even if many of the mechanisms such as selling livestock or assets, or withdrawing children from school often have adverse long-term consequences. In the sample of those affected, the share of those who sold or pawned livestock increases to 42.3 percent, while that of those who sold other assets increases to 54.1 percent. The probability of withdrawing children from school reaches 46.5 percent (again, this last result warrants more analysis), and that of using one's savings reaches 78.2 percent. The only case where the reliance on the coping mechanism is lower among those who incurred a loss than among the population as a whole is that of loans, which may again reflect the fact that those affected by losses tend to be poorer and thereby may not have access to credit, whether from friends or relatives or from financial institutions.
What about the correlates of the use of various coping mechanisms among the subset of households actually affected by a shock for which the information is likely to be more reliable than for the population as a whole? Table 6.2 provides the results of Heckman probit models (the first-stage probits on the probability

of experiencing a loss are not shown; they are very similar to the regressions presented in chapter 4). Country effects are still at work, but one interesting fact is that among those affected by shocks, the likelihood of using various mechanisms is not affected much by the quintile of wealth of the household (remember however that poorer households are often more likely to be exposed to losses due to adverse weather events). On the other hand, households in areas

characterized by worsening droughts tend to be more likely to have to sell assets, while by contrast the impact of worsening floods (the second factor in the MCA analysis) is only marginally statistically significant. Thus, apart from causing losses, droughts and the lack of rain are likely to have further negative consequences for households by inducing them to sell assets, while this is not observed to the same extent for floods.
Another finding is that some types of losses increase the likelihood that households will rely on coping mechanisms. Income losses are associated with a higher probability of relying on all coping mechanisms, while a loss in crops is associated with a statistically higher probability of relying on coping mechanisms in only three cases--selling or pawning livestock, selling or pawning other assets, and using one's savings. A loss of livestock or cattle is associated with a likelihood of relying on two mechanisms--selling or pawning livestock and using one's savings. Catching less fish does not lead to a reliance on the various coping mechanisms.
Landowners and tenants are more likely to have to sell livestock or ask for loans, but less likely to withdraw their children from school. Understanding this difference in behavior regarding schooling would require a more detailed analysis, but a possibility might be that children from landowners and tenants might already be less likely to go to school, because of the necessity to work the land. At this stage of the analysis this is only a conjecture. While the gender of the household head does not make much of a difference in terms of the coping mechanisms used, the education of the head does make a difference, with households with less-well-educated heads less likely to withdraw children from school, perhaps again because the children are already less likely to be in school. On the other hand, some of the occupations associated with lower earnings are also associated with a higher likelihood of withdrawing children from school. Instead of reaching a conclusion here on these patterns of withdrawal of children to school, a more detailed analysis of schooling patterns (who is enrolled in what grade, for example) would be required before reaching conclusion on that specific coping mechanism.
Households benefitting from remittances are less likely to ask for a loan, probably because they already receive some cash in hand thanks to the transfers that they receive from friends or relatives who migrated. Households with younger heads are less likely to sell assets or use their savings, and more likely to ask for loans. This might be because they have fewer assets that they can sell or savings that they can use in times of difficulties because they have had less time to accumulate those, which then forces them to ask for loans, while households with holder heads have more options apart from loans. Households with a head self-employed as a farmer are less likely to sell other assets, to use one's savings, or to ask for loans, perhaps because the ability of those households to do so is limited given their low earnings and accumulation potential or ability to repay loans. The lower likelihood of asking for loans is also observed for the self-employed in other sectors and servants as well as unqualified workers. Those working in fisheries or pastoral activities are on the other hand more likely to sell livestock, as expected. Finally, households with a head in the public sector are less likely to

sell livestock or other assets, possibly because many do not have livestock to sell, and may also not need to sell assets.

Household Adaptation Strategies
Households were also asked about actions that they took or might take to cope with the loss of crops, income or livestock due to weather or environmental changes. The possibilities included changing production technologies such as land preparation, sowing or weeding; changing crop choices, increasing crop variety, or adopting drought or flood resistant crops; changing the percentage composition of crops versus livestock; increasing the use of fertilizer or pesticides; seeking or increasing off-farm employment; and receiving occupational training for nonfarm employment. Households were also asked whether compared to five years ago, they used more stored water or consumed more stored grains and stored animal products. They were asked whether they were aware of people moving out of their community as a result of weather or environmental changes, and whether in the last five years people moved into their community. Finally, they were asked if in the past five years they experienced conflict over agricultural land or livestock, or water for household use or cultivation due to weather or environmental changes.
The results for those questions and most of the options available in the questionnaire are provided in table 6.3. For the sample as a whole, and for most of the alternatives presented in the questionnaire, only a minority of households have implemented any single one of the adaptation strategies. This is explained in part by the fact that many of the alternatives apply mostly to farming households, and not all households are involved in farming (this is evident in the fact that the proportion of households using the various adaptation strategies are higher among households who own land, many of whom farm their land). Between one in four and one in five households have relied more on stored grains/products and stored water, have sought off-farm work, have used more fertilizers or pesticides, or have made a change in their farm production technology. The proportion of those who have received training or changed their crop mix or the varieties they use is at about 15 percent. Only nine percent of households have changed their mix of crops and livestock for their livelihood.
On the other hand, more than 4 in 10 households say that they know people who have moved out of their community due to the climate pressures, and 14 percent declare that some people have moved in, which may at time generate conflict over water, land, or livestock. There are some large differences between countries in the use of adaptation strategies, with households in Egypt and Syria making fewer changes in their modes of livelihood than households in Algeria, the Republic of Yemen, and to some extent Morocco. It also appears that households in the bottom quintiles, which tend to be affected by climate change the most and have limited means to cope with weather shocks and changing conditions, also have made more changes in their livelihood strategies. But this may also be in part because a larger share of those households is involved in farming.

As before households with international remittances who tend to also be better off tend to rely less on those adaptation strategies than other households.
In a similar way to the analysis presented in the previous section on the correlates of coping mechanisms, an analysis of the correlates of the adaptation strategies used by households can be provided. This is done in table 6.4 with probit models for the main adaptation strategies. As for coping mechanisms, country effects are still at work, but among those affected by shocks, and in many cases the likelihood of using various adaptation strategies does not seem to be affected by the quintile of wealth of the household. There are exceptions though, with statistical significance in the case of the first quintile, as compared to the reference category of the top quintile. In many cases, the poorest households are more likely to use adaptation strategies, probably because they are also those affected the most by climate change, as documented in chapter 4. But in a few cases, households in the bottom quintile are less likely to adopt a strategy, and this is especially the case for terracing the land, increasing the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and (knowing people who are) moving out, three options that are often costly and may therefore be out of reach for the very poor (the fact that the very poor are less likely to witness conflict over water could possibly signal their lack of access or property rights over water).

As for coping mechanisms, households in areas characterized by worsening droughts are more likely to use most of the adaptation strategies listed, which makes sense given that they are more affected by adverse weather events. Apart from a few coefficients that are not statistically significant, the only exception is for terracing the land, which may again denote the cost of the option and may not be very effective against droughts. In addition, and this is different from what was observed for coping mechanisms, households more affected by floods and associated conditions are also more likely to rely on adaptation strategies. The only exception is the reliance on stored water, which is clearly not needed when suffering from an excess of water.
What about the impact of the type of loss suffered, when such loss was incurred? As for coping mechanisms, income losses tend to be associated with a

higher probability of using many of the adaptation strategies when the effects are strongly statistically significant, at least at the five percent level. Similarly, all strongly statistically significant effects for the loss of crops indicate a higher use of adaptation strategies. For livestock, the effects are more varied, with a higher use of some adaptation strategies and a lower use of others.
Landowners are also more likely to use the various adaptation strategies. This is again as expected given that they tend to be more affected by adverse weather events. The same is observed for land tenants, but to a slightly lower extent in terms of the magnitude of the coefficients, their statistical significance, and some cases with opposite effects (for people moving out and conflicts over water, although the second effect is only marginally significant.)
There are also some statistically significant effects in terms of the characteristics of the household head according to age, gender, marital status, education, and occupation, but these are more the exceptions as opposed to the rule given that many coefficients are not statistically significant. Still, households with younger heads are less likely to use many of the adaptation strategies, whether this is because they have fewer means to do so or because they have other options, including that of migration which is often undertaken by younger individuals. Households with a head working as a public employee are also less likely to have to resort to many of the adaptation strategies, the only positive and statistically significant effect being that of the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which is likely to be more affordable to them. Another result which was to be expected is that farmers are also more likely to rely on some of the strategies. What these results suggest is that even though overall the likelihood of using the various adaptation strategies is low in the sample, it is higher for those households who needs such strategies the most, both because of their occupation (in agriculture) and because of their exposure to shocks as captured by the two factors reflecting changes in weather conditions.

Community-Level and Government Responses
In the previous two sections, information was provided about ways in which households cope with or adapt to weather or environmental changes. What about the role of communities and governments? As mentioned in section two, the survey questionnaire asked households whether to cope with the loss of crops, income, or livestock due to weather or environmental changes, the communities in which the household live implemented a number of initiatives. Table 6.5 provides basic statistics on the shares of households declaring that this was indeed the case. Overall, the data suggest that the extent of community involvement to adapt to climate change is rather limited. While one in five households declares that the community has planted trees or taken soil erosion measures, and one in seven households mentioned community measures to purchase seeds, animals or farm equipment, the other actions that could be taken by communities are mentioned by only 1 in 10 households on average. There are large differences between countries, with households in Algeria and the Republic of Yemen much more likely to mention community initiatives than households in the other three
countries. Households in the bottom quintiles (as well as those owning land, although this is not shown in the table) are also more likely to mention initiatives, perhaps because they are more aware of these initiatives as they tend to be affected by weather shocks more. Still, many communities do not seem to implement the types of measures that might help households to cope and adapt.
Similar questions were asked about the role of governments, albeit as mentioned in section two with slightly different modalities, including more transfers and social protection programs, such as cash or food for work programs, cash for food during floods and droughts, as well as the provision of drinking water, the provision of skills training programs, the provision of credit during crop loss, improvements in access to markets through transportation, and price support for crops when agricultural prices are low. The results are provided in table 6.6. Except for the provision of drinking water which is less related to climate change and shocks, the extent of government involvement in adaptation strategies or safety nets is also limited. For most types of programs, only about 1 in 10 households declare that the government has been active. There are again differences between countries, with households in Algeria, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen more likely to mention government programs than households in Egypt and Morocco. In many but not in all cases households in the bottom three quintiles are more likely to mention initiatives, as was the case for community programs. Overall, as was the case for community-level responses, the extent of government support also appears to be rather limited.

Conclusion
The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of how households cope with and adapt to changing climatic conditions in the MENA region. The analysis of new household survey data from five countries suggests that while changes in weather patterns and the environment of households have affected a large majority of households, the coping mechanisms and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with those shocks are limited.
Many households appear to have to sell livestock of other assets when affected by adverse weather events, and a large share also appears to be withdrawing

children from school. The ability to ask for loans seems to be limited in the bottom quintiles, while savings can be quickly exhausted. These coping mechanisms, while necessary in the short term, may put at risk the ability of households to increase their earnings in the future, including for the children.
Furthermore, while the likelihood of using various adaptation strategies is higher among the most affected households, virtually all the adaptation strategies are implemented only by a small minority of households. This suggests that while adaptation is taking place, it may not be taking place at the level that the deteriorating climatic conditions appear to call for. Finally, the extent to which households benefit from community level and government programs and initiatives to help them cope with and adapt to weather and environmental changes is limited.

CHAPTER 7
Do Changes in Weather Patterns and the Environment Lead to Migration?
Franck Adoho and Quentin Wodon

Migration is one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions as well as extreme weather events. Yet while there is a burgeoning literature on climate change and migration and other adaptation strategies worldwide, the evidence available for the MENA region remains limited, in part because of a lack of survey and other data. This chapter is based on new data collected in 2011 in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen in two climate affected areas per country. The chapter provides an analysis of the impact of changes in weather patterns and the environment (as perceived by households) on migration, both by members residing in the households (temporary migration) and former household members who have left (permanent migration). The results suggest that perceptions of negative changes in weather patterns and the environment are indeed associated with a higher likelihood of migrating temporarily or permanently.

Introduction
There is a consensus that adverse weather events are likely to lead to migration as individuals and households migrate under climate pressures in order to improve their livelihoods. Such population movements have been taking place for thousands of years (Gupta, Anderson, and Pandey 2006), and today the resulting pressures are accelerating the process of urbanization, given that those most affected by climate change tend to be involved in agriculture in rural areas. With the climate expected to worsen in many parts of the world, including the MENA region, there is substantial concern that migration may accelerate, whether one refers to tye4rms such as environmental migration, forced environmental migration, environmentally motivated migration, climate refugees, environmental displaced persons, disaster refugees, environmental displaced persons, or eco-migrants to refer to this reality. Some estimates suggest that hundreds of millions of people may have to migrate in the next thirty to fifty years (Christian


Aid 2007; Foresight 2011; Jakobeit and Methmann 2007; Stern Review 2006), but there is considerable uncertainty about when and even whether such migration will take place.
Of course, climate change is not the only factor that may lead to migration. Most migrants today migrate in search of economic opportunities, and this search is only partially related to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events such as droughts or floods in rural areas. Said differently, there is probably no such thing as a `pure' climate migrant. In fact, the empirical evidence on the effect of climate patterns on migration remains limited, and different patterns may yield very difference responses. While fast-onset disasters may induce only temporary displacement (for example, Findley 1994; Haug 2002; Paul 2005), longer-term trends toward desertification or sea-level rise may have slower but more definitive impacts on the ability of households to remain in certain areas. Because of the many ways in which climate patterns may affect migration, and because migration is itself affected by many other dimensions apart from climate patterns, estimating the impact of weather or environmental conditions on migration is not easy. Ideally, it would be best to have data on changes in climate, as well as changes in migration patterns, and to correlate both while taking also into account data on many other factors that may affect migration. But such datasets are scarce, especially in the Middle East and North Africa where household surveys are few and often not publicly available.
This chapter is based on new household survey data collected in 2011 in five countries--Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen (on data collection and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al. 2014a, 2014b). For a brief review of the literature which informed the data collection and this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al. (2014a), both in this study.
One of the objectives of the surveys was to assess whether perceptions of climate change on the part of households affect migration decisions on the part of household members. The same household survey was implemented in two climate-affected areas in each country with only slight modifications in the survey instrument based on country-specific context. The survey elicited data on household perceptions of climate change and environmental degradation, and measured whether household members have migrated either temporarily (this is referred to as resident migration because the member still resides in the household) or permanently (this is referred to as nonresident migration).
There are a number of limits to the analysis that can be conducted with such data. First, because the surveys were implemented in sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we do not record information on the migration of entire households--we only record the migration of household members. This is however not too much of a problem given that most migration is typically undertaken by household members, instead of entire households. Second, the surveys are not meant to be representative of the five countries in which the work was carried, since only a few areas were surveyed in each country. Third, it must be
recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate shortterm versus long-term household responses. As we are working with cross-sectional household surveys and subjective perceptions of households regarding their environment, it could be that household perceptions of climate change are wrong--even if households declare that rainfalls are becoming more erratic, this may not be the case in reality. At the same time, one could argue that decisions such as that of migrating are influenced at least as much by the perceptions of households of the reality as by the reality itself.
These caveats being clear, the chapter is organized as follows. Section two introduces the data used for the analysis, and some of the questions in the surveys which are the focus of the discussion. Section three provides estimates of migration rates according to both household and individual-level characteristics. That section also discusses results on the subjective reasons mentioned by households as to why some of their members have migrated. Section four provides an analysis of the correlates of migration. A brief conclusion follows.

Data
As was the case for chapters 4 and 6 in this study, this chapter is based on the analysis of new household surveys implemented by Rand under contract with the World Bank and the Agence Française de Développement in five countries: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen. The same household survey instrument was used in all countries with minor adjustments to reflect country context. In each country, approximately 800 households were interviewed in two regions that tend to be affected by extreme weather events ranging from droughts to floods. For a discussion of the areas where the survey was implemented in each of the five countries, the reader is referred to chapter 3 which provides the necessary details.
While the data from all five countries were used without substantial problems in chapters 4 and 6, an important caveat must be noted for this chapter. Unfortunately, the quality of the migration data for one of the countries-- Algeria--is not as good as that for the other four countries. There are two different issues that must be acknowledged for the analysis conducted in this chapter. First, the Algeria survey turned out to have been implemented without proper and systematic identification of individuals within households, so that it is not clear that an individual coded, say, 5 in one section of the questionnaire is the same individual as the individual coded 5 in another section of the questionnaire. This means that individual-level regressions cannot be implemented with the Algeria dataset.
This problem does not affect household level regression analysis in other parts of the study as long as the household level analysis includes variables for the household as a whole or the household head (who is the first individual on which data is collected in the various sections). But it does affect regressions that require information on each of the individuals in the household, which is the
case for migration. Thus, neither statistics nor regression results will be provided for Algeria at the level of individuals, although we will provide some basic statistics at the level of households for that country as well as for the four other countries. In addition, the resident migration rates obtained for Algeria appear to be far too low. Thus, even though we will provide basic migration statistics for that country at the level of households, the results may not be as valid as those for the other countries, and again the detailed individual level statistics and the regression analysis will be conducted only with the sample for the other four countries.
The questionnaire for the surveys enables us to look at both temporary or resident and permanent or nonresident migration. We define temporary migration as migration by household members who are still considered as members of the households, while permanent migration refers to migration by household members who have left the household. It must be emphasized that because the surveys are not nationally representative and were implemented only in two sending areas affected by extreme weather events, we are not able to provide estimates of migration by entire households away from the sending areas--we only record the migration of household members. As noted in the introduction, this is however not too much of a problem, given that most migration is undertaken by household members, instead of entire households.
The survey questionnaires provide information on the migration of both resident and nonresident household members. While many surveys do have information on resident members, relatively few surveys also have a special module asking questions about nonresident migrants, but our surveys do. In addition, the surveys include a detailed module on household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment. The perceptions of these changes can then be related to the decision by some household members to migrate temporarily or permanently. It could be that household perceptions about the changes in weather patterns and their environment are mistaken, but even if this were the case, perceptions probably matter as much as real events in how household members make decisions regarding migration.
Apart from basic statistics, we rely on regression analysis of the correlates of migration decisions in order to assess the impact on migration at the margin (controlling for a range of household and individual characteristics) of differences in perceptions about changes in weather patterns and the environment. But we will also use a direct question asked to households about the main reasons for the migration of some of their members. The question was asked for resident migrants as follows: ""What were the two most important reasons why [NAME] moved here? Please state in order of importance: a--First reason; b--Second reason."" The potential answers for respondents listed in the survey questionnaire were as follows: (1) Better employment opportunity (seasonal jobs) in the destination; (2) Divorce/separation/death of spouse; (3) Better employment opportunity (nonseasonal jobs) in the destination; (4) Delivery; (5) Lack of employment opportunity in place of origin; (6) Family problems; (7) To accumulate savings; (8) Accompany patient; (9) Transferred (job); (10) Escape flood; (11) Schooling; (12) Escape
drought; (13) Better infrastructure; (14) Poor quality of land or depleted soils; (15) Join family; (16) Civil conflict/war; (17) Marriage; and finally (18) Other.
Of those answers, the options related to droughts and floods are directly related to extreme weather events, and some of the other options, such as the poor quality of land or depleted soils may be indirectly related to change in weather patterns and the environment. A similar question is asked to nonresident migrants, although with only one main reason for migration provided instead of two for nonresident migrants. Comparing the information obtained from those subjective perceptions of migration with the results from the regression analysis provides a way to check if the order of magnitude of the coefficient estimates obtained from the regression analysis appear to make sense or not.
migrants, whether resident or nonresident. When the question is restricted to migrants over the last five years, the proportion is lower, at 23.3 percent. Having nonresident migrants is more likely than having resident migrants, which suggests that the rate of permanent departure is fairly high. This is explained in part because some nonresident migrants leave the household to marry, which is a normal demographic process, but most nonresident migrants actually leave for other reasons, as will be discussed in more details below.
There are large differences between countries in the likelihood of migration, especially among resident members. Migration rates are highest in Syria where almost half of the households have migrants and the Republic of Yemen where a third of households have migrants. By contrast, migration rates are lowest in Algeria. In that country, while the nonresident migration rate may be realistic, the resident migration late appears to be very low, so one could wonder if there is not a data issue here, although a very low nonresident migration rate is also observed for Morocco. What is clear is that migration rates depend substantially on the particular features and history of each country, and indeed each region within the five countries. While there are differences in migration rates between quintiles of wealth, these do not appear to be very large, even if resident migration rates tend to be lower in higher quintiles. More differences will emerge when looking at the characteristics of individual migrants. There are also differences in migration rates according to whether households suffered from losses due to adverse weather events, but again they tend for the most part not to be very large.
The most important finding from table 7.1 for our purpose is the fact that there are differences in migration rates according to perceptions of changes in the
climate of the areas in which households live. In chapter 4 of this study, Adoho and Wodon (2014) construct through a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) two indices or factors that summarize household perceptions regarding changes in weather patterns and the environment. The first factor mostly captures the extent to which households perceive that the climate is becoming dryer and warmer, and it is associated with droughts and the lack of rain. The second factor mostly captures the extent to which households suffer from excess water, and it is associated with floods. Both factors are normalized and take a value between zero and one.
In table 7.1, migration rates are computed according to the quintiles of climate perceptions of households. For example, the first quintile for the first factor consists of the households who tend to perceive that the climate is not getting dryer and warmer, while the top quintile consists of those households who perceive that the climate is getting much more dry and warm, and these are the households most likely to be affected by droughts. The same interpretation holds for the quintiles of the second factor, whereby those in the top quintile are most affected by excess water, which essentially again is associated with floods. Table 7.1 suggests that household level migration rates are substantially higher in the top quintile of the first MCA factor than in the bottom quintiles, and this holds for both resident and nonresident migrations. The differences are not as clear-cut for the second factor. Resident migration rates are lower in the top quintile of the second MCA factor, while nonresident migration rates are higher in the top quintile.
Statistics were presented at the level of households in table 7.1 in part in order to be able to include Algeria in the analysis. But it is more interesting to analyze migration decisions at the individual level and data are available at that level. This is done table 7.2, although as mentioned in section two, Algeria is excluded from
this analysis. Some 7.6 percent of individuals in the sample as a whole have migrated temporarily, and the proportion over the last five years is 6.2 percent. For permanent migration, the rates are 8.0 percent in the sample as a whole, and 5.7 percent in the last five years. Migration rates at the level of individuals are by definition lower than at the level of households since only a subset of the household members migrate, but many of the points already made at the level of households remain. For example, migration rates are higher in Syria and the Republic of Yemen than in Egypt, and lowest in Morocco among the four countries for which data are provided. Importantly, while nonresident migration rates were higher than resident migration rates at the level of households, the two rates are of a similar order of magnitude when considering individuals. This is not surprising since, among other factors, resident migration is less costly to finance for a households than nonresident migration, so that more household members can migrate temporarily than permanently. There are some differences in migration rates by quintiles of wealth, landownership status and according to the types of losses suffered due to adverse weather events, but these tend not to be systematic.
Differences tend to be much more systematic when looking at the characteristics of the migrants. First, migration rates tend to be higher among heads of household for resident migration (heads tend to be those going away temporarily to find work), while they are lower for household heads among nonresidents (who have a household to take care of and cannot leave other household members behind permanently). The likelihood of migrating is clearly higher for younger individuals (those below the age of 30) than for older individuals (for example those aged 40 or above). Migration rates are higher for men than for women, and this is especially the case for nonresident migration. Finally, migration rates are higher when the individuals are more educated, probably because the opportunities for the more educated to find better employment opportunities elsewhere tend to be higher (for nonresident migrants, the top two categories of education have been merged in the statistics as is done for the regressions).
What is however of higher interest for this chapter is the relationship between individual migration rates and the climatic conditions of the areas where households live. The observation made regarding higher household-level migration rates in areas with poor conditions in terms of droughts remains--individuallevel migration rates are still higher in the top quintile of the first MCA factor than in the bottom quintiles, and this holds for both resident and nonresident migrations. But now, we also have at the level of individuals a positive relationship between high values for the second MCA factor, indicating areas subjected to floods, and migration rates, especially when considering the extent of migration over the last five years, which is also the interval on which the two factors for the perceptions about climate change are estimated. There is thus some statistical evidence that worse climatic conditions, or more precisely perceptions of negative changes in weather patterns and the environment, are associated with more migration.
To what extent are climate factors key determinants of migration? While this question is best answered using multivariate regression analysis, as mentioned in section two indicative information can also be obtained from direct responses given by respondents in the survey (typically household heads) about the reasons for migrating. The statistics on the self-declared reasons for migration are provided in table 7.3. In the case of nonresident migration, up to two reasons for migration could be provided, while only the main reason could be provided in the case of resident migration. Note that the data appear to be of better quality in the case of nonresident migration, where missing values are rare. In the case of resident migration by contrast many responses are missing, but the available responses are still instructive.
In the case of nonresident, the two main reasons to migrate are the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment opportunity in place of origin. Both reasons are related, but in terms of the language used, the first reason can be associated more with pull factors at the area of destination, while the second can be associated more with push factors from the area of origin. Together, those two reasons account for more than half of all departures for which information on the reasons to migrate is available. Marriage comes third
as the main reason to migrate permanently, reflecting the natural departure of young adults from the household. But when considering the second main reason to migrate permanently, accumulating savings is much more often mentioned than marriage, and that reason is also prominent as a factor leading to resident or temporary migration. Climate factors are mentioned as reasons for both nonresident and resident migrations, but not very often. In the case of nonresident migration for example, 5.7 percent of migrants cite the need to escape a drought as the first reason to migrate (virtually all households mentioning droughts are from the Syria survey, as shown in the annex), and another 5.9 percent mention droughts as the second reason to migrate (again, mostly in Syria). Floods are also mentioned, but to a lower extent.
In the case of resident migration, the data are not very good due to a large number of missing values, but when those missing values are eliminated, droughts are also mentioned as the first reason to migrate by around five percent of migrants. Furthermore, it is likely that the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment at the places of origin are also related in part to poor climatic conditions in the places of origin. Thus, as is the case for permanent migration, even if climatic factors may not be the main factor at play for the current patterns of temporary migration, they do appear to have a significant role.

Correlates of Resident and Nonresident Migration
While the basic statistics reviewed so far provide useful information on self-declared reasons to migrate (as seen from the point of view of the main respondent to the survey, which is typically the household head), a more robust and detailed analysis can be conducted using multivariate regression analysis. Recall in the discussion of the basic statistics the emphasis placed on comparing migration rates according to the level of climatic stress of households using the synthesis variables created by the multiple correspondence analysis. The basic statistics suggested higher rates of migration in areas with higher climatic stress. The question for the regression analysis is whether this apparent relationship between climatic factors and migration remains after controlling for a range of household and individual characteristics.
Tables 7.4 and 7.5 give the results from probit regression on the correlates of resident and nonresident migrations. Resident migrants are still considered to be part of the household, while nonresident migrants have left the household. The estimations are done for the sample as a whole and for those who migrated over the last five years. In each case two alternative specifications are provided. In the first specification, the losses incurred by households due to adverse weather events are included in the set of independent variables. In the second specification this is not done, given that these losses themselves are a result of adverse weather events, so that including them in the set of independent variables may take away some of the impact of weather events on migration. This does however not appear to be the case as most of the results are not very sensitive to the
difference in specification (with or without losses from adverse climate), but testing for the possibility that this could have happened was important.
The main variables of interest are the two MCA factors. Recall that these factors are normalized between zero and one, with values of zero denoting the best climatic conditions in the sample and values close to one denoting the worst conditions. The first factor captures events such as droughts and the lack of rain, while the second captures instead excess rain, and especially floods. In table 7.5, higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of resident migration, with the coefficients being statistically significant and the effects of each of the two factors of a similar order of magnitude. Tthe effects for nonresident migration are similar, although statistically significant only for the whole period, as opposed to the last five years. Thus overall higher values for both factors (that is, worse climatic conditions) result in higher rates of both temporary and permanent migration. For example, in the specification with the losses incurred due to adverse weather events, the maximum increase in the sample in the value of any one of the two factors from zero to one would yield an increase in the probability of resident migration of about five percentage points when considering the whole sample, and about 3.5 points when considering the last five years. That the increase is larger for the sample as a whole was to be expected, given that migration rates are higher when considering a longer period of time during which migration may take place. The effects are slightly smaller in the specification without losses. For nonresident migration, the effects are smaller, but still of a similar order of magnitude, especially for the full period estimation.
Are these estimates likely to be of the right order of magnitude? This is of course a very difficult question to answer with limited data, but a comparison
between the results suggested by the regression analysis and the data on subjectively declared reasons for migration mentioned in the previous section helps in provide at least a partial cross-check. Consider a large increase in the value of the MCA indices of 0.30 (those indices are scaled to take a value between zero and one, so that an increase in the value of any one of the two indices of 0.30 is large). If we look at the probabilities of migration in the last five years, this would generate an increase in the probability of resident migration of about one percentage point, while the impact on nonresident migration is not statistically significant. If we look at the data on migration for a longer period, the increase in migration is statistically significant for both resident and nonresident migrations, and it would be at about 1.5 percentage point for both types of migration. Given that the overall migration rate in the sample is at about 7­8 percentage points, this increase would not be negligible by any means, and it would represent between one tenth and one fifth of the overall level of migration observed. This proportion is a bit higher than the share of migrants who declared that droughts and floods were the main reasons to migrate, but this is what we would have expected given that poor climate may also be in part responsible for some of the migrants leaving the households temporarily or permanently in search of better employment opportunities or because of a lack of employment opportunity in their place of origin. Said differently, the findings obtained with the subjective perceptions of the reasons to migrate and the regression analysis of the impact of climate perceptions on migration tend to be broadly coherent.
What about the impact of losses incurred from adverse weather events? The marginal impact of most losses on migration are not statistically significant, with the exception of losses in assets or livestock, which are associated with a decrease in migration rates of just under two percentage points. This might be related to the fact that the resources needed to facilitate migration by household members may have been weakened (migration, even on a temporary basis, is costly when sending the migrant away, even if it generates additional resources later).
A number of other variables have statistically significant effects. In comparison to the reference country (Syria), resident migration rates are higher in Egypt and the Republic of Yemen, and lower in Morocco. For nonresident migration, the rates are again higher in Egypt than in Syria, and lower in Morocco, but the Republic of Yemen rates are also below those observed in Syria.
Resident migration rates tend not to change much by quintile of well-being. For nonresident migration by contrast, the effects are much larger and statistically significant, with poorer households less likely to have nonresident migrants, probably in part because of the cost of sending one household member away permanently. Landownership above one acre of land--which may be a sign of wealth in rural areas--is associated with a statistically significant increase in permanent migration by household members, while households renting land as tenants are more likely to have some of their members migrate temporarily. The effect of education on resident migration is not systematic, while it is again for resident migration with the better educated much more likely to migrate, a finding that is coherent with the previous comment made about the relationship
between wealth and permanent migration. Self-employed individuals working in agriculture tend to migrate less, and this is observed for both temporary and permanent migration, but those with low employment status (the unemployed, servants and unqualified workers) are more likely to be nonresident migrants, controlling for other household and individual characteristics, probably because of better employment opportunities elsewhere.
In terms of demographic variables, the effects are as expected as well. Individuals from larger households are more likely to migrate permanently (their labor is likely to be less needed at their place of origin given the presence of other household members), while the effect is smaller and less often statistically significant for resident migration. Another important difference between resident and nonresident migrations is that the likelihood of resident migration is higher for household heads, while for nonresident migration it is higher for other household members, as expected. Both resident and nonresident migration rates are much higher for younger individuals, with the effects being especially large for nonresident migration.

Conclusion
Migration is one of several strategies used by households to respond to changes in climate and environmental conditions as well as extreme weather events. The objective of this chapter was to use new household survey data collected in 2011 in two climate-affected areas of five MENA countries (Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, and the Republic of Yemen) in order to assess whether perceptions of changes in weather patterns and the environment are correlated with the decision to migrate by some household members. Both resident (temporary) and nonresident (permanent) migrations were considered. Statistical as well as regression analysis were implemented.
Overall, the findings from both the statistical analysis and the regression estimates suggest that socioeconomic and demographic factors today probably play a larger role than climatic factors in the temporary and permanent migration decisions of household members. This is a finding that is coherent with other chapters in this study, some of which use similar analytical methods while others are based on different types of data and approaches.
However, this does not mean that changes in weather patterns and the environment do not play an important role in migration decisions. When combining the results from the statistical analysis and the regressions, it is legitimate to suggest that climatic events may well account for about 10­20 percent of current levels of migration, which is still large. And the role that weather patterns play could well increase in the future as climatic conditions deteriorate further.

Climate-Induced Migration in the MENA Region: Results from the Qualitative Fieldwork
Audra K. Grant, Nicholas E. Burger, and Quentin Wodon

This chapter is based on qualitative focus group and in-depth interview data collected among rural residents and urban migrants in the five focus countries for this study. The chapter documents the relationship between climate change and internal human mobility as seen by the population, as well as some of the other adaptation strategies used by households to cope with a deteriorating climate. Rural residents are clearly aware of climate change. They perceive a shift in climactic conditions that affects their livelihood due to deteriorating agricultural conditions. Among households affected by climate change, migration appears to be more of a strategy of last resort than of first resort, although there are exceptions. For those who migrate to urban areas, obtaining a job as well as a proper dwelling is hard and further hindered by corruption and competition for limited employment opportunities. The obligation to send remittances also puts pressure on migrants. Yet, despite difficulties and pressures, the perceived benefits of migration in terms of the independence and opportunities afforded by urban life remain substantial.

Introduction
The MENA region is experiencing warmer temperatures and precipitation levels are falling. Adverse extreme weather events are expected to increase in frequency and severity in coming decades. As a result of its impact on the environment, climate change has significant effects on economic outcomes. In many MENA countries--including those that are the focus of this study--economic growth and poverty levels are strongly influenced by agriculture and agricultural-related activity. For example, about three fourths of Morocco's poor depend on agriculture for their livelihood. This population lives on land with poor agricultural potential which is sensitive to changes in rainfall. While agriculture in Morocco represents only one seventh of gross domestic product (GDP), it employs almost half of the labor force.
A similar pattern is evident in the Republic of Yemen, where agriculture accounts for a similar share of GDP and employs 55 percent of the labor force. In the Arab Republic of Egypt also, agriculture represents only one seventh of GDP, but it employs 55 percent of the labor force. In the Syrian Arab Republic, 45 percent of the population works in agriculture, and the country is on the verge of water poverty, against the backdrop of declining rainfall and a decline in the availability of agricultural land as well as rising temperatures (MSEA 2010; Qabbani 2010; el Atrache 2009). Such trends are evident throughout the MENA region where it is estimated that overall, 80­100 million people may experience water stress by 2025 (Warren et al. 2006). By 2050 water availability per capita is expected to decline by 50 percent versus current levels and declining precipitation is likely to reduce further the availability of agricultural land and its productivity, thereby endangering the livelihood of millions of households (UNDP 2009).1
As vulnerable rural populations attempt to cope with new and challenging circumstances, various strategies are at their disposal. Individuals or households may eat less, sell assets, remove children from school, or they may migrate as one of a number of strategic choices. Migration is indeed a common means of dealing with risks from the environment. But the extent to which climate change affects migration is unclear, because migration is affected by multiple push and pull factors. Push factors do include changes in the climate such as warming temperatures, heat waves, declining rainfall, and also floods, among others. These events act as catalysts for migration from rural to urban areas or to other countries, whether temporarily or permanently. This is because climate and subsequent environmental degradation decrease agricultural crop production, as well as livestock or water availability, which adversely affects economic activity. But pull factors that may have nothing to do with climate change also influence migration. The existence of economic opportunities such as employment, well-established community networks that help reduce uncertainty and risk, and housing in urban areas may all be variables that pull migrants to a particular area independently of changes in the climate. The possibility of better access to schools, health care, electricity, and possibly clean water and functioning sewage systems in urban areas also influences the decisions of some migrants to leave.
There is unfortunately a dearth of rigorous analysis on climate change and migration to better understand the impact of climate change on human mobility in the MENA region. This is not only the case for quantitative analysis, but also for qualitative analysis. For a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. (2014) and chapter 2 on the five countries of focus for this work by Burger et al. (2014a) in this study.
As a complement to the quantitative analysis conducted in other chapters, the goal of this chapter is to contribute to a more in-depth or ""thicker"" understanding of the complex relationships between climate change, environmental degradation, and migration than is feasible through statistics and (reduced form) econometric analysis. The chapter seeks to illustrate the precarious conditions rural communities face as a result of climate-induced environmental degradation,
identify why potential migrants select--or do not select--various adaptation strategies including that of migration, and describe the challenges household members face once they choose to relocate to urban areas.
More precisely, this chapter aims to provide answers to a number of questions, each of which addresses various aspects of the relationship between climate change and migration. Among residents in rural areas, what do respondents see as the greatest challenges facing their households? As households attempt to cope with unfavorable agricultural conditions caused by climate change, how prevalent is migration as an adaptive strategy relative to others? To what extent do economic and social burdens differ across gender? What is the role of remittances for rural household productivity and survival? Among urban migrants, key questions include: For those who have opted for migration as an adaptation strategy, to what extent has integration into urban settings been a positive process or a negative one, and why? How important are community networks for reducing uncertainty, such as for providing information, access to employment opportunities, and for facilitating the overall social and economic integration process? To what extent have the expectations of rural migrants been met? And finally, among rural migrants, what is the likelihood of return to rural places of origin?
In order to explore these themes, focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted among both rural residents and urban migrants in the five focus countries--Morocco, Egypt and Syria, and Algeria and the Republic of Yemen (on data collection and the choice of focus countries, see Burger et al. 2014a, 2014b). The participants in focus groups and the individuals who were interviewed were asked about their perceptions of climate change, and their individual views of household circumstances and other factors that shape migration choices and other adaptation strategies. Each of the five countries is subject to climate change and environmental degradation, but not to the same extent. Given variance in historic experiences, domestic institutions, and climate pressures, one would expect that individual attitudes and responses would differ between areas and countries. To some extent, this indeed turned out to be the case, and yet there were many similarities in the experiences shared across countries.
The chapter is structured as follows. Section two outlines the reasons for conducting qualitative work as part of this study and the approach used here through focus groups, semi-structured in-depth interviews, and interviews with key informants. Section three discusses the findings for sending rural areas. Section four does the same for receiving urban areas. Section five is touches upon the correspondence between the qualitative results presented in this chapter and some of the results obtained using household surveys in other chapters. Section six summarizes some of findings from the interviews with key informants. A brief conclusion follows.

Rationale for Qualitative Work and Methodology While this study relies mostly on quantitative survey data, it also factors in through this chapter qualitative fieldwork. The combination of quantitative and
qualitative data is important and warranted by the nature of some of the questions being analyzed. Before presenting the qualitative data sources, it is useful to briefly outline some of the reasons that have led to the decision to combine quantitative and qualitative data sources for this study.
Survey-based and other quantitative methods have long been privileged in the development economics and environmental science literature because of the higher degree of statistical reliability of such data. But qualitative research tools have also proved to be important to identify social issues, assess stakeholder interests and interactions, and identify the many different transmission channels through which exogenous shocks as well as policy interventions may have an impact on individuals and groups. That is, qualitative research and findings have often been found essential to complement the traditional focus on quantitative analysis.
Quantitative methods based on statistics provide robustness to the results if they rely on appropriate samples, and regression analysis helps to control for a large number of other variables when measuring the impact of a specific variable on a given outcome. Yet quantitative data often cannot fully capture causality, especially when the analysis fails to provide appropriate contextual information. Qualitative methods help to shed light on why people make the decisions they do. Qualitative research is often people-centered, and it may include both objective and subjective dimensions, to the degree that it considers both objective conditions for people's lives and their perceptions and feelings about their situation. While this can also be done to some extent with quantitative data, qualitative data often provides a richer context for interpretation.
An important aspect of qualitative research methods refers to what scholars call research access. While no hasty conclusions should be made about the advantages of qualitative research techniques (respondents may refuse to be interviewed while they may accept to fill in an anonymous questionnaire), such methods are often better suited to address sensitive issues. One example in the case of this study relates to women's perceptions of the implications of climate change and migration. In the quantitative survey data collection, in part because of cost constraints, only one person was interviewed in each household, and this was typically the (male) household head. In the focus groups and in-depth interviews, care was taken to interview both men and women, which provides for a better understanding of the point of view of women on climate change and migration issues. This is important given that in the region, migration remains primarily undertaken by men, who may have a different view of its benefits and costs than women. Also, the challenges faced by those women who have migrated need not be the same as those faced by men--the risk of sexual and other forms of harassment is for example much higher for women than it is for men, but the social as opposed to economic opportunities that migration may provide in terms of gaining more freedom is likely to be higher for women.
Another argument in favor of integrated research methods relates to the potential of complementing quantitative data with actor-oriented perspectives in applied research. An actor-oriented perspective entails the variety of social
practices and at times incompatible worldviews between various actors and the multiple realities to which these practices and worldviews respond. In the case of research on climate change and service delivery, key actors would include not only the household members who migrate and those who do not, but also the governmental officials and nongovernmental experts who implement policies and programs in this area. The experience and voice of those affected by climate change as well as the perspective of professionals are often overlooked when relying only on quantitative survey data.
Still another argument in favor of integrated research methods relates to policy making. Qualitative data derived from interviews and focus groups are often criticized for their subjectivity. This is a legitimate concern, and it underscores the fact that qualitative research methods must be implemented rigorously by well-trained researchers, with their results ideally supported by further quantitative analysis. But at the same time, policy-oriented social analysis is concerned with change and agency. In such contexts, the subjectivity of the various actors, and how as persons they perceive their situations matters for understanding the basis of agency.
The qualitative fieldwork for this specific study is especially important because it is the only information available in the study on how well migrants are doing in urban areas. This is because the survey data collection and most of the analysis conducted for the study focused by design on rural sending areas. But assessing through qualitative fieldwork how well migrants are doing is crucial to understand what is going on in sending areas, since outcomes for migrants affect through their ability to send remittances how well households are doing back home.
For example, part of this study suggests that remittances tend to be received less (in probability and in amounts) by households living in climate poor areas, even if though remittances received in those areas are even more crucial than elsewhere to reduce poverty and improve human development indicators. This chapter helps to understand why remittances do not always reach climate poor areas. This is probably in part because many urban migrants from those areas have a hard time finding good jobs, so that even if they consider it their moral obligation to send remittances back home, they may not always able to do so. Furthermore, this migration appears to be a strategy of last resort in the areas most affected by droughts and a deteriorating climate, which may also help to explain why households living in those areas are less likely to receive remittances. This could appear counter-intuitive. Given that opportunities are scarce in the areas most affected by the changing climate, one would expect high rates of migration away from those areas. Yet once the social context is taken into account, it becomes clear that migration is not necessarily the first choice of migrants in those areas because they have strong personal links with their area of origin that many do not wish to lose through migration (this is however highly context specific and varies between countries).
In this chapter, the qualitative findings that are discussed are based on results from focus groups semi-structured in-depth interviews, and interviews with key
informants. A general description of the methodology used for the qualitative analysis is provided in chapter 3 (Burger et al. 2013a). Additional details are given in this section and especially in annexes 8A through 8C to this chapter. On focus groups, the original intent was to conduct them in the five countries. But lack of security in the Republic of Yemen made focus group recruitment difficult, and in Algeria focus group recruitment was hampered by local suspicion. In both countries, this led to a shift toward semi-structured in-depth interviews which provide similarly rich and textured information. The fieldwork was conducted among adults 18 years of age and older in each country between November 2010 and February 2012. Results are based on seven focus groups in Morocco, Egypt, and Syria, with each group comprising six to eight participants: four focus groups among urban migrants, who have relocated internally from rural areas; and three focus groups in each rural area among rural residents. In Algeria and the Republic of Yemen, as already mentioned, semi-structured interviews were conducted instead. The rural areas for the qualitative work were selected among the sites used for the household survey data collection: M'Sila in Algeria, Lamzoudia in Morocco, Dakhalia in Egypt, al-Hassakeh in Syria, and Hudaydah in the Republic of Yemen. The urban areas were the countries' largest, most populous cities: Algiers, Casablanca, Cairo, Damascus, and Sanaa. Table 8.1 summarizes the location of the qualitative research sites.
It was suggested earlier that a key contribution of this chapter to the overall study consists in documenting the living conditions of migrants in urban areas. To what extent is the choice of the cities in table 8.1 appropriate for conducting the focus groups and in-depth interviews? Is it correct to implicitly assume through the choice of these sites for the fieldwork that most migration is toward urban areas, and specifically toward large urban centers, so that the choice of these cities would be appropriate? Table 8.2 provides data from the household surveys collected in the five countries in mostly rural areas affected by adverse weather shocks. Those are the data used in several other chapters of the study (chapters 4, 6, and 7). While those data are not nationally representative, they are representative, or at least illustrative of the weather and migration patterns in some of the areas most affected by climate change
In table 8.2 nonresident migration refers to permanent migration by household members who used to belong to the household but have left. Resident migration by contrast is temporary, in that the migrant is still considered by the household as being part of the household in the areas of origin. Table 8.2 suggests that for four of the five countries (due to data issues this analysis cannot be

performed for Algeria), both temporary and permanent migration takes place toward urban areas, especially in the case of nonresidents. In addition, for nonresidents the survey questionnaire identifies separately small urban areas and large cities, and clearly migration is taking place mostly toward those large urban centers. Given that the focus in this chapter is on permanent migrants, conducting the interviews in the cities listed table 8.1 seems appropriate.
Discussions in focus groups and in-depth interviews in urban areas were organized around core questions, with probing for specific aspects or subquestions within each of the main question. The same was done in rural areas, but with a different set of questions. Annexes 8A and 8B provide the list of questions used in urban and rural areas, as well as the subtopics on which the focus group leaders and the interviewers (for in-depth interviews) probed participants. In addition, key informant interviews were carried with a dozen government officials and a dozen respondents from universities, international organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in each country. The main questions asked to government officials and nongovernmental experts are listed in Annex 8C.
To understand who participated in the urban focus groups and in-depth interviews, it is important to note that filters were used for the selection of participants. If a migrant came from another urban area, or if s/he had relocated to the present area more than 10 years ago, s/he was not selected in the sample. Only migrants who had relocated because they could not earn a living in rural areas due to poor agricultural conditions or because they needed to migrate to work and help their family were included in the sample. Those who said that they migrated because they were tired of their area of origin, because they needed to migrate to go to school or because they missed friends and family relatives who had moved to their urban area were not selected.

In addition to focus groups and in-depth household interviews where the focus groups could not be implemented, we also relied on interviews with key informants. This is because the ability of countries to adapt--and help affected populations adapt--to climate change depends in part on governance and institutional capacity (Sowers and Weinthal 2010). In order to assess this capacity and the extent to which issues related to climate change and migration were present in the policy and development agenda, interviews were carried with key informants--government officials and nongovernmental experts--in each of the five countries. For the purpose of understanding the decisions to migrate of household members and the consequences, both positive and negative, of such decisions for both migrants and the household back home, the information obtained from key informants was not the most valuable. But that information does help in placing climate-induced migration in a broader context. For that reason, we also report as an example the feedback received from key informants in the specific case of Morocco, because for that country key informants were especially knowledgeable about migration flows.

Focus Groups and In-depth Interviews in Rural (Sending) Areas
Focus group respondents were aware of the shifts taking place in the climate and attribute associated declining agriculture fortunes with deteriorating environmental conditions caused by changing weather patterns. Conditions in rural or ""sending areas"" have become very difficult, according to the vast majority of focus group respondents. Participants complained of fewer days of rainfall and lower irrigation levels. For key crops such as potatoes, wheat, and rice, the results are devastating. ""Rice is burnt in some seasons, because we cannot find enough water to irrigate it"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia). Egyptians, in particular, also cited government expropriation of agricultural land as an obstacle to profitable and sustainable agriculture, though this problem was not mentioned in other countries. Many former rural residents from each country also mentioned the rising costs of seeds and other agricultural inputs. Rural residents explained that poor quality of crops mean lower prices for agricultural products and this reduces income. While incomes from agricultural activity are decreasing, the prices for essential goods are on the rise, observed most participants. The inability to earn a stable and adequate income from crops implies that relying solely on agricultural activity is not feasible any more. The experience shared in box 8.1 from a resident in the town of Djelfa in Algeria is one shared by many other focus group participants and respondents in the in-depth interviews.
Rural residents have no choice but to rely on multiple sources of income because without such additional income sources, households cannot sustain themselves. One Egyptian woman explained that poor prices turn farmers away from agriculture altogether: ""They [farmers] used to exert earnest effort in the past because the gains were equally profitable, but now it is of no use. Land [requires] a lot of money and the earnings then have to be distributed among
Box 8.1Testimony from a Rural Respondent in Algeria
Well, the conditions [for] farming are very poor. There's drought on the one hand and the unavailability of the new equipment and poor methods we use on the other hand. Of course, this is the main problem in our life. Our life here depends on the rain, and if there is no rain, how could we survive? The rain is the main source of life here. ...The impact of poor weather conditions on my farm was disastrous to my farm's yields. My income from cereals and vegetables is not enough to feed my household. As I mentioned, the income [has] decreased to its minimum, and I cannot regain the cost of farming over the last two years. All farmers in this region have been affected by the drought and lost their yields (Male, 35­45 years old).
many in the family"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt). Or as a Syrian man put it: ""When the al-Kabour river was flowing, there was a labor force here and people were able to cultivate their lands, but now..."" (Male, 25­45 years old, alHasaka, Syria). Traveling long distances between homes and jobs is cumbersome--and expensive--with a number of respondents from all five countries expressing frustration about the expense of transportation and lack of good roads.
In the Republic of Yemen, almost every rural resident from the area of Hudaydah emphasized the severity of the warm weather and increasing heat waves. Electricity that allows for cooling functions only two to three hours per day, causing residents to lose sleep during the evening due to excessive heat. Residents, therefore, tend to sleep during the day because of exhaustion. As a result, fewer daytime hours are dedicated to work and income generation. Furthermore, Yemeni respondents explained that agricultural productivity is further complicated by lack of governance and neglect of the agricultural sector, ineffective government policies, and corruption. Unfavorable crop prices and pressures to generate income amid extreme rural poverty have caused growers to shift away from agricultural food crops in favor of qat production which is far more profitable: ""...People there [in villages] work shoulder to shoulder, but the problem lies in agriculture. They have stopped cultivating crops and coffee beans and replaced them with qat, which now [dominates] agricultural lands. And we note that there are more than 300 qat vendors in the single market. How much do they add up to in the overall Republic? ...Tomatoes, now, are now non-existent, and it is essential now that we important them from Syria"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen). But qat requires a great deal of water, and Yemeni respondents noted with worry that water scarcity has led to conflicts over access to wells. As a way to cope with water scarcity, a Yemeni woman from Hudaydah described a complicated water distribution scheme where water is distributed to certain communities on certain days of the week.
For farmers in all five countries, the burden of living in impoverished rural areas is not just one of financial cost, but also one of poor health, a concern mentioned frequently by Egyptian rural focus group respondents. For example, some
pointed out that farmers are being increasingly exposed to contaminated water because waste leaks into irrigation canals. Other Egyptian participants mentioned being sick due to illnesses such as the flu. With only limited income at their disposal, many Egyptian respondents said that their households cannot afford quality health care or cannot access health facilities because they are not in close proximity.
The fieldwork suggested that coping strategies are multifaceted among rural households. Common coping mechanisms include selling assets, removing children from school so they can work to support the household, and shifting food consumption habits such as eating less chicken or beef or eating one less meal. Most respondents report having had to employ one or more of these mechanisms to cope with the negative impact of climate change on agricultural production. Borrowing food or money from the community is also an important survival and coping mechanism in times of economic stress. Women, in particular, are also mindful of the impact of income losses on their ability to help their children get married: ""It affects everything. My husband passed away and my monthly income is 60 or 90 EGP, i.e. nothing. Sometimes I refuse a suitor of my daughter because I cannot afford getting her married"" (Female, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt).
Rural respondents also stated that on the whole there is only limited or no involvement of local organizations in their communities, including nongovernmental organizations. In the absence of such organizations to provide advice and assistance and help mitigate the impact of climate change on agriculture, rural residents rely on each other. As a rural Egyptian man explained: ""Rural residents are willing to pay [give] half of what we have to help others. If I have 10 pounds [Egyptian pounds], I will pay 5. If I have 100 pounds, I will pay 50. This is how the social norms work here. We are all one family"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt).
With rural poverty levels high and prospects of substantially improving incomes low, remittances are essential for daily survival. They can be used to purchase durable goods, food, clothes, health care, land, and housing but they can also be used to invest in businesses. Remittances are vital as they may contribute to the health of both household and national economies. Remittances appeared especially important for rural focus group respondents from the Republic of Yemen, where a number of participants declared having family members who had migrated internationally, primarily to Persian Gulf countries. Saudi Arabia is the most popular destination for Yemeni migrants, and remittances allow those who receive them to enjoy a reasonably high standard of living. In the absence of remittances, live is much harder: ""My brother is in Saudi Arabia. He used to send me money all of the time and we were well off, even when I wasn't working. [But] we lost the house and everything we [owned] because of the discontinuity of these aids. We live at God's mercy"" (Male, 30­45 years old, Hudaydah, the Republic of Yemen). By contrast, participants from Morocco and Algeria did not appear to depend as much on remittances, and only a few mentioned that they receive remittances from relatives. Across all focus groups, no one referred to seeking solace or assistance from mosques and respondents were united in their
reprehension toward using children to peddle, saying emphatically that it is never unacceptable.
When asked if they were aware of government or nongovernmental programs addressing climate change in their communities or helping to alleviate its social and economic impact, many respondents stated that they were not aware of such programs. But there were some exceptions. A few Yemeni residents mentioned the Saleh Organization, but concluded that it only provided temporary help or relief. Rural Algerians were aware of forms of government assistance for the agricultural sector, referring to low-interest loans and government provision of advisors who travel to villages to help teach growing methods. However, the impact of the advisors appeared uneven. More isolated locales are far from their reach, and on the main, bureaucracy and corruption make loan acquisition from formal institutions such as banks a lengthy and frustrating process. So much so that many farmers said they avoid this option altogether.
Rural participants in the fieldwork suggested a number of government initiatives that could help farmers better adapt to their changing environment and could help blunt the economic impact of decreasing agriculture. Table 8.3 summarizes commonly mentioned recommendations for government assistance among respondents. In addition, Egyptian respondents mentioned the importance of strengthening agricultural unions. In one focus group, rural participants recalled that in the past agricultural unions were stronger and benefitted from linkages to the Egyptian parliament, and therefore were in a much better position to serve agricultural interests.
Government provision of agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizers was also suggested in addition to the provision of loans to purchase machinery or for livestock breeding. However, participants were less sanguine about whether any real changes would actually materialize. Pervasive local and national-level corruption and patronage were seen as major obstacles to progress in the countryside: ""We need machinery that would help us collect rice ashes instead of burning it and to press wood automatically. Livestock breeding ... are also projects that are of low cost to the government"" (Male 36­45 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt).

Syrians in al-Hassakeh recommended removing the dam at the al-Kabhour river to allow greater access to water for the population, in addition to encouraging the government to keep its promises to improve rural infrastructure. Assistance with navigating the process to obtain loans was also requested. Job training and improved employment opportunities for both rural men and women were mentioned as helpful in all five countries. Men and women said that although local norms may frown upon women working, particularly in public spaces typically reserved for men, training and employment that is discreet and can be done in or near the household would be welcomed by men and women. In contrast to respondents from the other countries, Moroccan participants were virtually unanimous in objecting to rural women working in positions deemed unacceptable according to community norms (for example, sales and teaching), since this is considered shameful. Some Yemenis were doubtful that any government program would bear fruit, citing corruption and distrust of Yemeni institutions as the reason for their lack of confidence.

Focus Groups and In-depth Interviews in Urban (Receiving) Areas
Most migrants who participated in the focus groups and in-depth interviews came from households that depend on rainfed agriculture for their livelihood. The typical profile is a man aged between 25 and 45. The majority of female participants relocated to urban areas to follow their husbands. Younger women between the ages of 18­25 are unmarried and migrated to the cities to work in order to support their families back home. All female participants had a relative or close family friend who already lived in the city and they arrived accompanied by a relative.
Why migration? Many respondents said that they migrated from their rural homes because chronic droughts caused a decline in agricultural productivity. Few mentioned floods or being displaced as a result of natural disasters as the reason for their relocation. ""There is lack of water has resulted in a failure to be able to cultivate rice and it is an important crop"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Dakhalia, Egypt). Married urban female migrants recalled having to increase their workload prior to migrating to cities. A woman who resettled in Cairo explained that women in her village have to help their husbands because it has become too expensive to hire cheap agricultural workers: ""We used to help our husbands during harvest collection instead of getting people to do this against a sum of money. Life was difficult there [in the village], so we decided to come here to Cairo as it is more comfortable"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt).
A finding consistent across all five countries was that many (but by no means all) respondents appeared to have chosen migration as an adaptation strategy of last resort after other strategies proved unsuccessful. Many migrants described a life before they migrated of hardship and precariousness accompanied by a constant lack of food, water, and income for basic needs, education, and employment. In many households, male family members had to leave school in order to work, and many families also had to eat less and forego at least one meal per day.
Selling assets was common: ""My father sold mattresses, furniture, and our bed covers. We even sold our last cow during sacrifice. We had nothing"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco). ""My father was a farmer and he could not work anymore. There was no rain, only drought and labor was soon replaced by machines. For example, my mother used to earn income milking cows. She was replaced by machines"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).2
A critical step in the integration process for migrants resettling in urban areas is finding employment. Most rural migrants said that they came to urban areas in search of better job opportunities, either to support their parents or to improve future prospects for themselves and their own family. Jobs commonly held by female migrants include housecleaning, and working as a seamstress. For men, there was more variety, including occupations such as waiter, mason, doorman, gardener, baker, seller of vegetables, fruits, and crafts, factory worker, small shopkeeper, janitor, car parker/attendant, and driver. Many men hope to ultimately save enough to own their own small business, such as a small shop. Finding jobs, however, is not an easy feat amid high unemployment in the region, especially among youths. While some respondents found that urban communities were receptive to their arrival from the countryside, others said that they were met with more hostility, especially in Morocco and Syria, where respondents complained of negative stereotyping and pervasive discrimination from established urban residents, particularly when trying to find viable employment: ""They look at us and call us `Berber countrymen'. They think we are invaders"" (Male, 18­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
Some rural migrants from Morocco said they felt disadvantaged vis-à-vis their urban counterparts because they lacked a degree and French-and Arabic-speaking capability, features that are needed to secure even the jobs requiring minimal skills: ""When I go look for a job, they ask for a degree and French--this is for hairdressing, sewing or couture"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca). Syrian rural migrants, likewise, said that they felt inferior and unwelcome in Damascus. Wherever they went, they felt treated like strangers and ""different."" This makes finding a job difficult. For Yemenis, the main obstacle to finding a job was corruption, which is deep and pervasive. Corruption was mentioned by Yemenis as a major problem in general far more often than other participants: ""You need to bribe your way into a position. That is your easy way toward a good job position ­ and we all love the easy way"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa). Table 8.4 lists some of the jobs held by respondents (only women indicated occupations of housecleaning and seamstress; the other occupations were dominated by males).
Almost as challenging as finding a job is the challenge of finding a decent place to live. Virtually all participants shared their frustration with the lack of adequate housing. Urbanization has caused a shortage of housing in many cities, and many immigrants live in suboptimal dwellings. Uncomfortable and overcrowded conditions appear to be the norm for both newly arrived and more settled migrants: ""I'm 39, married, with five kids and I don't have a flat of my own. I pay 300 Egyptian pounds per month and cannot have a flat. Why don't they grant me one? They say you have to rent for just one year, and then it all depends on the owner"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). ""We live on top of each other. There's no privacy. Sometimes you get your money stolen"" (Male, 18­25 Casablanca, Morocco). Algerian rural migrants often live in slums that have poor services and inadequate infrastructure. Expert interviews indicate that Ben Messous, Diar Echam, and Oued Keriche are popular areas for rural immigrants relocating to the city. ""The condition of my house or slum is very bad. In winter the rain comes through the ceiling, and it is very cold, (no central heating) and in the summer it is very hot because I have no air conditioning. To be honest, my slum is not even suitable to house animals"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Algiers, Algeria). For Yemenis, the specter of corruption is again a problem, as a resident of Sanaa who wanted to construct a home explained (see box 8.2).
Migrant community networks in urban areas are critical for acquiring information about available jobs and housing for new migrants. Such networks make certain areas more attractive than others, and they facilitate the transition for migrants. Established communities often share a lineage, tribe, birthplace, or ethnic background. Relatives or family friend are key intermediaries for finding a job and a place to live. Social networks are critical for information gathering and for reducing the risks and uncertainty associated with migration. One young Egyptian male migrant attributed his success in finding a job rather quickly to a cousin who had connections with members of the medical community. But another said: ""I had no family relations--and it took me a whole year to get a job"" (Male, 25­35 years old, Cairo, Egypt).
Even for those with access to a social network, feelings of dislocation were common, and one of the least appealing aspects of relocating to urban areas is the loss of personal interactions with community members, and of the sense of belonging to a community. Many migrants noticed that they now only have limited interactions with their neighbors, if they are fortunate to know them at all,

Box 8.2Testimony from an Urban Respondent in the Republic of Yemen
The house is owned but the problem is that you either build or take a random permit. Permits cost up to 60 thousand riyals of which 20­30 thousand are bribes. And paper-work takes two to three weeks, and if we don't pay the bribe they would complicate and even create problems because the Yemeni people have become accustomed to bribery. One loses the sense of this duty due to the fact that his job is underpaid and he does not consider taking another one since he allots his afternoons to qat consumption"" (Males focus group, age 35­45)
and they also lamented the shift of emphasis on family and traditions. In the words of one Egyptian woman: ""Neighbors are close in the villages. Here [in Cairo], I don't know my neighbors, what their job is or how they live"" (Female, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt). Crime and harassment also comes with life in the city. Harassment was mentioned especially by female Moroccan respondents who voiced dismay with the unwanted attention they receive from men: ""We are always subject to problems in the street. Men harass us and they say bad words. We fell like strangers here. When they know we are strangers, they treat us worst"" (Female, 25­35 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
Yet migration also offers opportunities, especially for youths. Young Moroccan respondents expressed a greater sense of independence, belonging, and self-actualization. A married man celebrated his new life, which no longer included working with eight brothers in the countryside. Another said that a friend returned to their village dressed in a suit and he immediately wanted to be like him. For other young former rural dwellers, relocating, while challenging, was still a chance to realize one's potential: ""I want to have a secure job, to be able travel, be able to see other places, other people. ...to live my life!"" (Male, 20­25, Casablanca, Morocco). Moving to the city may also be emancipating. Some Moroccan women noticed that since they migrated, they have little desire to get married and have children right away. One said that she escaped a life of near-servitude. Another explained that she left her rural home to escape an arranged marriage. Compared to life in the rural sector, the ability to work in the city also offers more autonomy for women: ""I could work, get married, have babies and have a husband who will beat me up. Marriage age in my [rural] area is 18 to 19 years old. I've worked like a slave in others' homes. No more. I wanted to come to Casablanca to live, work and maybe get married"" (Female, 20­25 years old Casablanca, Morocco). These various views among both men and women were however much more prevalent in Morocco than in the other four countries.
Given both the challenges and opportunities of urban life, views are mixed on whether or not migrants would like to return to their rural homes. Men were far more likely than women to say they will someday return to their rural homes, preferably as more prosperous individuals. Although cities offer a wider range of opportunities for migrants and their children, migrants, and especially men did miss the stronger sense of community in rural areas. Women, by contrast, appeared to appreciate more the distance from their families, for the reasons mentioned above.
Finally, remittances figured prominently in the resource allocations of migrants. In Egypt items such as ghee, oil, bread, flour, and sugar are purchased for families in addition to funds being sent directly to homes. In all countries, the amounts sent back vary with the level and stability of the migrants' incomes. Male respondents tended to remit more than females. But for most migrants, male and female, sending remittances to their family was without doubt a moral obligation: ""They [our families] are in a terrible situation. Sometimes they call us to send money each month. Sometimes, I go without dinner or not spend much
needed money on myself so I can send money to my family. Without money, they cannot eat. They would have no money for the souk to get food to eat"" (Female, 20­25 years old, Casablanca, Morocco).
While most urban migrants reported sending remittances to their family in rural areas, some Yemeni urban respondents stated that they received remittances from family members working abroad, especially in Saudi Arabia. For many rural and urban Yemeni households alike, international remittances appeared critical to household survival. ""We do not rely on jobs. My mother is a government employee she gets paid 60 thousand riyals which does not cover expenses for seven days, but we rely on the income that comes from the my father who works abroad in Saudi Arabia"" (Male, 30­39 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen). ""My brothers work in Saudi Arabia to provide good living for themselves and their families here in Yemen. They send me money when I need it because my work is not enough for me and my family. ...wages in Saudi Arabia are good and he works one job which is sufficient for him and his family living in Yemen. We rely upon them a great deal. Employment outside Yemen is available in addition to the currency difference. If the surplus is sent to us, it is better than a month's salary here. If it weren't for them we would have nothing to eat"" (Male, 25­30 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen).
It is also important to note that mobility also involves seasonal migration, especially among men. About a fifth of male focus group respondents declared periodically returning to their rural places of origin. Some travel during holidays and specials occasions, amounting to travel roughly two to three times per year on average. Smaller numbers return to help cultivate land still held by their families or to live part time with their families. Respondents reported that this is very challenging as it costs money to travel and maintain housing in the city: ""I worked for a month or two and kept going back to my village in between. But I wasn't able to save money this way. So, I searched for a place so I could have my family with me and it took me a whole year until I found a suitable room"" (Male, 36­45 years old, Cairo, Egypt).
On balance, views are mixed regarding the degree to which expectations from migration have been met. The primary objective of acquiring sustainable employment is often more difficult than respondents anticipated, particularly for women. Many expected to find a job much sooner than they did. Others, more broadly, expected a more stable and social lifestyle. Many have had a difficult time making friends in the city and overcoming stereotypes. Long work schedules also are obstacles to making friends. Importantly, all would like in the future to have a better education. For Moroccans especially, this means acquiring the ability to speak French or finishing their general education in order to have better paying occupations.
What about the areas where respondents felt that government and nongovernmental programs might help? Access to health care, education and job training, credit for housing and rental assistance were deemed vital among participants for advancing the integration of rural migrants into urban communities. Some suggestions were also more country specific. In Morocco some
respondents complained about not having the appropriate official documents that would enable them to work and receive financial credit: ""Our life is in crisis. When you don't have official documents, what else can you do?"" (Male, 35­45 years old, Casablanca, Morocco). As mentioned earlier, French-speaking capability was also seen as relevant in the Moroccan context for fully functioning in the labor force. The service sector and high-skilled labor sector require French because of significant interaction with French speaking Moroccans or Europeans.
While language was not a problem for focus group respondents from the other countries, Moroccan respondents called for government assistance in French language training.
Egyptians emphasized the need for government assistance with agricultural inputs such as seeds and fertilizer, as well as no-interest loans and credit. Yemeni residents had little faith in their institutions to provide assistance: ""I heard about [various programs] and [people] did not get their help because those responsible ... are taking the money which they promise to help the citizen with. Also, with institutions of disabled people we hear that they are funded with millions, but the money is being divided in between government officials"" (Male, 25­30 years old, Sanaa, the Republic of Yemen). Other focus group participants' views were also critical of their governments, but the sentiment was not as widespread and virulent elsewhere as was the case in the Republic of Yemen. Table 8.4 summarizes some the areas of focus proposed for government assistance by urban respondents.

Heterogeneity between Countries in the Reasons for Migration
A quick read of the discussion in the two previous sections could be perceived as simply highlighting common tendencies in the various countries for both urban and rural areas. There are clearly such common tendencies, but one should not underestimate the heterogeneity in the qualitative data and in the underlying circumstances of individuals and households, including in terms of the reasons for migration and how well migrants fare once they have migrated. These circumstances are highly dependent on the local context. There are not only differences between individuals and households, but also between areas within any country and between countries in the drivers of migration. Depending on the country, migration may or may not be a strategy of last resort, and the decision to migrate may or may not be closely related to droughts and declining agricultural fortunes at their place of origin. The role of pull versus push factors is likely to be different in the various countries given differences in dynamism and opportunities.
The fact that there are differences between areas and countries actually comes up in the qualitative data presented above. On average, migrants in Morocco, and to some extent also in Egypt, tend to mention more frequently the opportunities that migration may offer at the places of destination in terms of jobs and freedom, while migrants in Syria, and to some extent in Algeria and the Republic of

Yemen, are quicker to relate their decision to migrate to the difficulty to survive in rural areas due to the deteriorating climate, droughts, and low agricultural yields. For triangulation of the results from the study, it is reassuring that these stylized differences between countries in the reasons to migrate obtained from the qualitative work also show up in the quantitative data from the household surveys implemented at the same time and in the same sending areas in the five focus countries (see chapter 3 on data collection). In the surveys households could provide two reasons for the migration of household members. Basic statistics on those reasons to migrate are provided in table 8.5 for permanent (nonresident) migration.
For the sample as a whole, the two main reasons to migrate are the search for better employment opportunities and the lack of employment opportunity in place of origin. Both of these reasons are of course related, but as mentioned in chapter 7, in terms of the language used, the first reason can be associated more with pull factors, while the second can be associated more with push factors. Marriage is also important, especially so in Algeria, but this cannot be related specifically to push or pull factors. Climate and environmental push factors, such as droughts and floods, as well as the poor quality of land or depleted soils are mentioned, but less often, and virtually all mentions of droughts come from Syrian households. Accumulation of savings is another important reason to migrate, and can probably be associated more with pull factors than with push factors, even if one could discuss this (schooling and better infrastructure also relate more to pull factors, although less in terms of direct employment opportunities and livelihood).
Dividing the share of the main reasons associated with pull factors with the share of the main reasons associated with push factors yields a simple index that can be compared for the various countries. As shown in table 8.5, the ratio of pull versus push factors is highest in Egypt, where it takes on a value of 3.10. This makes sense given that Egypt is the country the least affected by droughts, with data from a recent study by the Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands and the United Nations Secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction Regional Office for Arab States suggesting that only 2.04 percent of the country is vulnerable to droughts (ACSAD and ISDR 2011). The ratio of pull versus push factors in our household surveys is lowest in Syria, where it takes a value of 0.80, which again makes sense given that Syria is by far the country in our sample the most susceptible to droughts according to the ACSAD-ISDR study (almost two thirds of the country is vulnerable to droughts according to that study), and that it did suffer recently from major droughts that led to substantial displacement. Among the other three countries, the Republic of Yemen has the largest ratio of pull versus push factors, which may be related to the opportunities provided not only by Sanaa but also by neighboring Saudi Arabia. And Morocco has the lowest ratio, which corresponds again well to the fact that after Syria it is among the five focus countries the most susceptible to droughts.

Interviews with Key Informants: The Example of Morocco
One more piece of empirical evidence was collected for the qualitative fieldwork through interviews with key informants. In all five countries government officials and nongovernmental experts are well aware of the stress caused by changes in climatic conditions, and of the fact that climate change contributes to rural-urban migration flows even if today it is not the main driver of these flows. They also realize that in most cases, the lack of sufficiently ambitious and well-developed policies and programs contributes to the inability to propose concrete solutions and help to those most affected by climate change in rural areas. Many of the comments made by government officials and nongovernmental experts in the various countries were similar, so that rather than provide examples from all countries, it is probably more instructive to cover one country in slightly more depth. This is done in this section for Morocco, because more respondents were either experts on migration or were conducting ongoing research on migration-related issues.
Key informants in Morocco explained that migration was historically by men and driven by inequitable development in rural areas. The absence of networks in destination areas made women vulnerable to prostitution or slave labor, so they were less likely to migrate than men. Migrants migrated both internationally and internally, in that case principally to Casablanca, which continues to remain as a prime destination for rural migrants since the Greater Casablanca area alone still attracts around 15 percent of all national migration flows in the country. Today territorial units nearby Casablanca have also become preferred destinations for newcomers. This is for example the case of Ain Sebaa, Sidi Moumen, Moulay Rachid, Hay Hassani, Mohammedia city, and districts of Sidi Bernoussi and Hay Mohammadi. Migration to other to cities has also picked up as rural migrants are searching for destinations closer to their homes.
Key informants explained that three main features remain central to migratory flows irrespective of origin and destination locations. The first is the importance of networks which play a critical role in providing support to migrant families and in helping them to decide their destinations. A second key feature is the importance of the remittances sent by migrants, which are critical not only for household survival in rural areas but also for communities. In Tiznit for example, migrant associations are helping build two thirds of the roads. Several informants also stated that migration facilitated women empowerment in rural areas, as the women who remained in the countryside while their husbands were away working in the cities gained more independence and were also more likely to interact with their neighbors. A third important feature, especially in recent years, has been the role of climatic patterns in internal migration. Drastic changes in climatic conditions have led to an expansion of shanty towns. In Tafilelt for example, a fourth of the population has migrated due to climatic hazards that had affected agricultural production. Likewise, in the Draa region which has historically been an important center of trade but more recently has been experiencing frequent and longer droughts, out-migration has increased. In general, informants agree that the so-called Oasis belt is
losing its population as people are becoming increasingly affected by the negative effects of droughts.
Outgoing migration is primarily stemming from the water crisis that Morocco is experiencing. Six of our respondents mentioned water as a major issue, in part due to more droughts, but also with flooding in some areas. For example the Tafilalt region, one of the most important oasis regions in the country, has suffered from severe droughts and flooding which in turn have undermined the oasis agriculture. While droughts used to occur every four to five years, they now occur every two years. Climatic hazards are also leading to severe desertification in the Sahara region. Rising sea water levels are also a concern, among others in Saadia were tourism may have contributed to destroying plant life and consequently making the land vulnerable. A respondent suggested that 60 percent of Saadi may soon be under water.
These severe climatic conditions have had a large impact on rural populations, with farmers experiencing increased water scarcity with no access to water reserves. Women have to travel much further away to get water. Some respondents were convinced that agricultural yields will fall by 20 percent in 20 years, which drive more migrants from rural areas toward urban centers. Life in the cities will then become difficult for both locals and migrants. Many respondents mentioned ongoing housing and employment crises in urban areas. As locals and migrants compete for survival, integration will become a major problem and economic discrimination will rise, as may black markets and the informal economy. In large cities such as Casablanca, many migrants are already found to be living in shanty towns. The pressures of living in cities along with influences from urban lifestyles have also been weakening social structures between migrants and their families which may have severe consequences for those still living in Morocco's rural areas.
In recognition of these challenges, respondents explained that the Moroccan government launched initiatives at both the national and local levels. One such initiative is a higher focus on rural development programs, among others, through the Human Development Initiative (HDI) which is designed to target vulnerable populations in both rural and urban areas. At the local level, the government is also conducting awareness programs to inform people about climate change. The objective is to teach people about conservation and preservation of water resources, disaster preparedness to limit the negative effects of droughts, and different irrigation schemes to encourage the agricultural sector to become independent of water resources. Climate change has also been included as a key component in other initiatives such as Morocco Green and the Communal Development Plan. There is also an Energy Strategy Plan being initiated, and work is ongoing toward an insurance plan named `Natural Catastrophe Insurance.' Active research programs are also on-going in a few universities. Despite these initiatives, respondents perceived some fatalism, with many believing that everything is happening because of Allah's will. And at times government programs may contribute to the issues. One respondent mentioned a dam which instead of stopping flooding drained water resources from the ground, leading to poor water quality and affecting surrounding palm trees.
Conclusion
Adverse weather trends such as increased flooding and droughts shape the decisions to migrate made by household and individuals. Climate change is widely perceived to reduce crop yields and livestock production, decrease water availability, reduce fishing populations, and limit opportunities in rural areas that depend heavily on agriculture. The goal of this chapter was to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between climate change, environmental degradation, deterioration of agriculture, and human mobility, through an exploration of the attitudes of rural residents and urban migrants in our five focus countries. Rural residents use a range of coping mechanisms to survive, ranging from eating less and borrowing money to selling livestock and other assets. Remittances are also important for survival, and when this source of income is insufficient, additional household members are forced to migrate to other areas in search of better opportunities. Overall, while in some countries such as Egypt and to some extent Morocco, there is a perception that migration opens up new opportunities, in other countries such as Syria, for many migrants migration may be a strategy of last resort than a real choice. While such differences between countries seem to emerge from the qualitative fieldwork, and tend to also be supported by quantitative household survey data, of course individual situations remain highly household and area specific within each of the five countries.
The qualitative work also suggests that for urban migrants, the arduous task of obtaining a job is further hindered by corruption and fierce competition with locals for limited employment opportunities. Social dislocation is a risk, with many migrants feeling inferior, alienated, and different in their new urban environs. Many face job discrimination, harassment, and exploitation at the hands of their supervisors and would-be employers. Poor housing conditions, rising food and rent prices, and the obligation to send remittances back home place substantial pressure on urban migrants. Yet, these coexist alongside some benefits. For example, migrants appreciate the independence, social outlets, and opportunities that urban life has to offer.
A number of suggestions were made by households as well as migrants about the types of programs that could be of help to them, in both urban and rural areas. It is not the place in this chapter to comment on whether such recommendations are appropriate, or even feasible to implement by governments. In order to come up with such an assessment, a much more detailed analysis of the types of programs proposed, their cost and their benefits, would be required. But what does emerge from the interviews with key informants is that while government officials and nongovernmental experts are aware of the consequences of climate change and extreme weather events for the population, they also recognize that the extent to which governments are dealing with these issues today is limited. This is a finding that is also emerging from other chapters in this study, in that both the community level responses and government programs and policies not only to cope with weather shocks but also to adapt to climate change, remain insufficient.
CHAPTER 9
Is Climate Change Likely to Lead to Higher Net Internal Migration? The Republic of Yemen's Case
George Joseph, Quentin Wodon, Andrea Liverani, and Brian Blankespoor

Concerns abound about the potential impact of climate change on future migration, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, one of the regions that is likely to suffer the most from climate change. Yet it is not clear whether so far climate patterns have been a key driver of internal migration in countries such as the Republic of Yemen, despite the pressures created by water scarcity. By combining data from the Republic of Yemen's latest census and a weather database as well as other geographic information, we analyze the determinants of past net internal migration rates. Next, using future climate change scenarios, we predict the potential impact of rising temperatures on future net internal migration rates. The results suggest that while climate does have an impact on net internal migration rates, this impact is limited, so that on the basis of past patterns of climate and migration, rising temperature may not have a large impact on future net internal migration.

Introduction
Climate change is likely to lead to substantial migration flows (for a recent review of the evidence to-date, see Foresight 2011). Jakobeit and Methmann (2007) suggested some years back that there may be up to 150­200 million environmental refuges in 30 years, but this estimate was considered as conservative by the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change (2006) and the Foresight report notes that 42 million people were displaced by natural hazards just in 2010. It is also clear that the impact of climate change may be very different on different types of households depending on their coping mechanisms (see Meze-Hausken 2004, on Ethiopia) and that the magnitude of migration flows will depend on country conditions. For example, fast onset disasters such as hurricanes and floods, as well as droughts or decreasing agricultural yields may lead to only temporary displacement (for country case studies, see Findley 1994; Haug 2002; Henry, Schoumaker, and Beauchemin 2004; Paul 2005; Shuaizhang

et al. forthcoming; see also Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl 2006), while slow onset events such as desertification or rising sea levels may take longer to occur but may also have longer lasting effects on net migration flows.
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is likely to be one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, both due to a number of cities threatened by rising sea levels and the vulnerability of agricultural production given water scarcity which is expected to increase further. Average temperatures in many MENA countries may increase by two degrees Celsius by the end of the century, including in the Republic of Yemen, a country where the depletion of groundwater resources is likely to reduce agricultural output by 40 percent (World Bank 2010; for a review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. [2014] and chapter 2 on the focus countries for this work by Burger et al. [2014] in this study).
In a country like the Republic of Yemen, climate change is likely lead to higher migration principally due to the need for households to improve their livelihoods. But many households also tend to be fairly attached to their area of origin, and when they move, this is typically driven more by socioeconomic factors than climate variables, as shown by Joseph and Wodon (2013) using a gravity-type model with census data on internal migration rates combined with data on weather patterns at the district level. Building on Joseph and Wodon (2013), we consider in this chapter net migration rates (as opposed to bi-directional flows) and predict to what extent changes in climate are likely to affect such net internal migration flows. We focus on net migration rates because from a policy point of view, these are likely to be more important than overall bi-directional flows.
The results suggest that controlling for other factors that may affect net internal migration rates, these rates tend to be lower toward areas with higher temperatures, but the impact of temperature on net migration rates, while statistically significant, is small. Using predicted values for future temperatures under alternative climate change scenarios, out-of-sample predictions of expected net international migration rates suggest limited changes in patterns of migration due to rising temperatures. It should be emphasized however that because we rely on past patterns of migration and climate, our results can only be considered as suggesting (in an imperfect and indicative way) that slowly changing climate patterns may affect migration in the not too distant future in a limited way only, but they should not be relied upon to assess how structural breaks such as dramatic changes in climate patterns may affect long-term migration.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section two presents our data and methodology. Section three describes our results. A brief conclusion follows.

Data and Methodology
Net internal migration rates are obtained at the district level from the latest the Republic of Yemen census implemented in 2004. The census has information on 2,752,629 households with 19,708,760 individuals living in 333 districts. It provides information on the current residence, previous residence and place of birth
of all individuals living in the Republic of Yemen at the time of the census. Information is also available on the number of years each individual has been living in the current residence, which along with age enables us to compute net internal migration rates for different age cohorts. For each cohort, we have 333 observations corresponding to the 333 districts in the Republic of Yemen (as of the administrative structure in 2004). Considering seven cohorts corresponding to age groups defined at five years of interval for the population aged 20­54, this provides us with 2,331 observations. The census also provides demographic and socioeconomic information including the level of education of the population, its occupation and employment characteristics, and the extent of urbanization. Finally, we also have at our disposal poverty estimates at the district level that were obtained through the combination of household and survey data through the poverty mapping technique (see Elbers et al. 2003).
In addition, information on the distance between major cities in each district is calculated from the highest population center in each district to all other districts using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 software, and the same procedure is used for distance to the coast. Travel time to the nearest city with 100,000 populations uses a methodology developed from Nelson (2008) with regionally specific information (World Bank 2011). The road data provide kilometers of asphalt roads. The mean slope of district land is derived from a global dataset by Verdin et al. (2007). The percentage of irrigated land is taken from Global Map of Irrigated Areas version 4 (Siebert et al. 2005; Siebert, Hoogeveen, and Frenken 2006). Weather data on annual mean temperature and rainfall and their variability are collected from BIOCLIM (Busby 1991).
Denoting by Yi the net internal migration rate to district to as a proportion of the population of the district, and by Xi the characteristics of the district, we estimate a standard regression using a fractional logit model:

Normalized weights pk are obtained by dividing sk by R2 so that each weight is expressed as fraction of the percentage of total explained variance and the
weights sum to 100. Five slightly different specifications are used to test for the

robustness of the coefficient estimates. The first model or baseline specification does not include dummy variables for the governorates (the administrative level immediately above the district), and it includes the climate variables in both levels and squared values. In the second model, governorate dummy variables are added (although not shown in the regression table--these estimates are available upon request). Next, in the third specification we keep the governorate dummies, but do not include the quadratic terms for the climate variables.
In the last two specifications, we also keep the governorate dummies, but we replace the climate variables that measure seasonality by three intervals each including one third of the districts, with the ""low"" interval (in terms of temperature or rainfall) being the excluded reference category in the regression, and the other two intervals being included as dummy variables. The reason to do so is that for the predictive analysis, while we do have estimates of future temperature and rainfall from climate change models, we do not have estimates of future seasonality in temperature and rainfall that are as reliable. At the same time, it is unlikely that for most districts changes in seasonality would be so dramatic as to shift the interval of seasonality to which a district belongs. Then the last two models can then be considered as the best models for out-of-sample predictions of the potential impact of higher temperatures and lower rainfall on future net internal migration rates. The difference between the last two models is that one includes squared values for mean temperature and rainfall, while the other does not.
For the predictions of future migration under likely future climate patterns, we rely on data from Strzepek and Schlosser (2010). These data provide expected percent changes in temperature and precipitation for the years 2030 (defined as the average for the period 2026­35) and 2050 (defined as the average for the period 2046­55) on a monthly basis in comparison to the model baseline (1961­ 90) which are historical data from the CRU TS 2.1 (Mitchell and Jones 2005). Strzepek and Schlosser define three scenarios (Wet, Mid, and Dry) using a Climate Moisture Index (CMI), which is an indicator of the aridity of a region. The CMI depends on the average annual precipitation and average annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). The Wet scenario is defined as the global climate model (GCM) that has the largest increase in average CMI over the baseline period, while the Dry scenario is defined as the GCM that has the largest decrease in average CMI over the baseline period. The Mid scenario is defined as the GCM closest to the mid-point between the Wet and Dry scenarios. Since GCMs vary in spatial resolution, the results are coerced to the CRU half degree by half degree resolution and then summarized by district.

Results
Table 9.1 provides basic statistics on the main variables of interest. Net internal migration rates are not very large. They range from -2.86 percent to 0.37 percent. The fact that the rates are larger in negative values suggest that net internal migration on average tends to take place from districts with smaller populations to districts with larger populations, as expected. Table 9.1 also provides summary
statistics for the independent variables used in the regression. The summary statistics show that the Republic of Yemen's population still lives predominantly in rural areas with an average urban population across districts of about 20 percent. Trade and services provide employment to 42 percent of the employed. Education levels tend to be low, with 17 percent of the population above 40 years of age being literate. The share of irrigated land is also low, at only 4 percent.
Mean temperatures are relatively high, but not excessive at 22 degrees Celsius. Precipitations are low, at 200 millimeters per year on average. Temperature and precipitation seasonality are high. Many districts are located far from the nearest city with more than 100,000 inhabitants. Most districts also have limited water, public lighting, and road infrastructure.
Regression results are provided in table 9.2. Net migration rates are smaller in districts with a large population, but this is a stock effect--even if migrants tend to go to more populated districts, given that rates are expressed in proportion to existing populations, larger districts tend to have smaller rates controlling for other factors. Poverty does not seem to be correlated with net migration in a statistically significant way, even though the sign is negative as expected in almost all cases. Districts with a higher share of urban population have lower net migration rates--this could be seen as surprising, but the raw data suggests indeed that migration does not necessarily take place toward the largest cities, at least within the Republic of Yemen (there is apparently substantial international migration toward cities in Saudi Arabia, but this is not captured here).
Migration tends to be directed toward districts with a higher share of employment in trade and services, which does make sense, given that many migrants may be leaving agricultural occupations. Migration is higher toward areas with higher access to piped water supply, although the impact of public lighting is negative in a few cases (but also smaller and only marginally statistically significant). Migration is higher in areas with a higher share of the population above 40 having secondary education, with a negative correlation in the case of tertiary education--this might capture areas where migrants have a reasonable expectation of finding good employment, given that many migrants will not have tertiary education. Migration tends to take place in areas with less irrigated land--maybe because areas with irrigated land are already well occupied. Travel time to the nearest large city is in many cases positively related to migration rates but this is partly offset by the squared term, and in some cases, the impact is not statistically significant, including for the preferred specifications (4) and (5). The same can be said for distance to the coast. Finally, migration rates are higher for the age groups 20­24 and then 25­29 (the reference category is 15­19) than for any other age group, as expected.
As for climate variables, there is a clear negative effect of higher temperatures on net migration rates, which is important for our out-of-sample predictions of future migration. The sign and the magnitude of the coefficients tend to be stable across specifications (taking into account the squared term when included). By contrast the impact of the level of rainfall is not statistically significant. Seasonality also does matter, and this is easiest to see in specifications (4) and (5) which suggest higher net migration rates to areas with lower temperature variability, with a smaller impact again for rainfall which is not always statistically significant.
The fact that temperature--in levels and variability--affects net migration rates is an important result, but this does not mean that the effect is large. As shown in table 9.3 which provides the results of a decomposition of the explained

variance proposed by Fields (2004), these variables account only for a limited share of the explained differences in net migration rates between districts (Fields decomposition shares can also be computed for regional governorate effects in the regressions, but these shares are small and therefore are not included in the table). The share of the difference in migration rates explained by temperature levels is only at about 3­4 percent when considering linear and quadratic terms, and it is lower when quadratic terms are omitted. This is small in comparison to the role of urbanization, education, infrastructure, employment, and even population size. This suggests that changes in future temperature levels might have only a limited impact on future net migration rates.
have a statistically significant impact on net migration rates, the out-of-sample predictions were computed only for expected changes in temperature). For easier reading, the districts were grouped into three intervals, each accounting for one third of the districts, and labeled as low, medium, and high temperature districts. Because migration rates are higher for the age group 20­24, we present statistics for that group, as well as for older individuals. The table suggests that net migration rates are lower for low and high temperature districts. Predicted migration rates are obtained under higher temperatures under the mild, dry, and wet scenarios, and considering both expected temperatures in 2030 and 2050, but the differences versus the predicted migration rates today are very small, and the differences between the three scenarios, as well as between 2030 and 2050 are also small. In other words, at least based on patterns of past migration, expected changes in temperature might not affect net internal migration rates to a significant extent.
Conclusion
Is climate change expected to generate larger net internal migration flows in the Republic of Yemen away from areas with higher expected temperatures? Using census and weather data, this chapter has tried to answer this question. We found that although higher temperatures and higher variability in temperatures are associated in a statistically significant way with lower net migration rates, the effects are not large. Out-of-sample predictions suggest that with the increase in temperatures that are to be expected under various climate change scenarios, the impact of climate change on net migration rates is not likely to be large. It should be strongly cautioned however that these results are based on past patterns of migration and climate in the Republic of Yemen, and ""business as usual"" extrapolations of past patterns. Therefore, the simulation may not capture what might happen in the future under more drastic changes in climate, including much more severe weather shocks.

Extreme Weather Events and Migration: The Case of Morocco
Minh Cong Nguyen and Quentin Wodon

Do extreme weather events such as droughts or floods lead to migration away from the areas affected by these events? This chapter aims to provide an answer to that question for Morocco using a new nationally representative household survey implemented in 2009/10. The data suggest that around one in four households have been affected by weather shocks in the five years preceding the survey implementation. Droughts and floods are not directly identified by households as major reasons for migration, but insufficient agricultural revenue and a lack of agricultural employment as well as better employment opportunities at the place of destination are mentioned as reasons to migrate, and these are affected by adverse weather shocks. Furthermore, in regression analysis, after controlling for a wide range of individual and household characteristics, the probability of both temporary and permanent migration increases if the household has been affected by an adverse weather shock or the consequences thereof. Thus, while adverse weather events may not be the main driver of migration, they do contribute to it.

Introduction
The frequency of droughts has increased in Morocco over the last few decades, with negative impact on farmers and the economy as a whole (Azzam and Sekkat 2005; Barakat and Handoufe 1998; Skees 2001). Most agricultural land is not irrigated, which means that affected households often have limited ways to reduce the impact of droughts on their livelihood (Skees 2001; Swearingen and Bencherifa 2000). In chapter 5 of this study, a recent national household survey for Morocco was used to document the extent to which Moroccan households, and especially those involved in agriculture, are confronted with extreme weather events such as droughts. The analysis suggested that most households working in agriculture were affected by weather shocks, often seriously. In the population as a whole, the proportion of households affected was about one fourth, simply because households not in agriculture were not likely
to be affected. Many households affected declared not being able to recover from these shocks.
Given the high level of vulnerability of households to weather shocks and their limited means to cope with the shocks and adapt to climate change, one might expect that weather shocks would contribute to out-migration in the affected areas. It would make sense that some household members would leave the areas most affected by drought, and there is indeed some evidence to this effect. After a severe drought in 2007, two thirds of the illegal migrants arrested in Spain were from the farming and mining region of Khouribga (EACH-FOR 2008). Another study by Hamza, El Faskaoui, and Fermin (2009) found that environmental degradation was one of the reasons leading to past or intended migration. Yet these studies have been fairly localized and based on small samples, so that it is difficult to generalize from them--for example the study by Hamza, El Faskaoui and Fermin has a sample size of 30, so that it is unclear at the national level whether climate shocks are a major or relatively small factor affecting migration.
The objective of this chapter is to test whether these weather shocks indeed contribute to migration, both temporary and permanent, by using a broader sample (for a brief review of the literature which informs this chapter, see the introduction of chapter 1 by Wodon et al. (2014) and chapter 2 on the focus countries for this work by Burger et al. (2014) in this study. The analysis is based on a nationally representative household survey? the Morocco Household and Youth Survey (MHYS) implemented between December 2009 and March 2010. Much of the questionnaire of that survey focuses on issues critical to youth, such as the obstacles they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation. But the questionnaire also included data on migration as well as on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks. One of the shocks is that of adverse weather events (such as droughts and floods). It is thus feasible using econometric techniques to assess whether households who were affected by extreme weather events experienced higher migration rates among their members after controlling for a range of other household and individual characteristics.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section two introduces the data used for the analysis. Section three provides basic statistics on the extent to which households are affected by weather and other shocks, and on the extent of both temporary and permanent migration among household members. Section four then provides the multivariate analysis of the correlates of temporary and permanent migration among household members. A brief conclusion follows.

Data
As was the case for chapter 5 of this study, this chapter is based on data from MHYS implemented in 2009/10. The survey is nationally representative (even if it does not include the scarcely populated Western Sahara southern part of the country) and it includes data on 2,000 households (1,216 in urban areas and 784
Climate Change and Migration · http://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-0-8213-9971-2
in rural areas). The survey was implemented with funding from the World Bank between December 2009 and March 2010. Much of the questionnaire focused on issues critical to youth, and especially the obstacles that they encounter on the labor market and for civic participation. Questions were also asked about young people's intentions to emigrate. Other more traditional modules deal with standard questions on household member demographics and education as well as employment information. The questionnaire also focused on various shocks affecting households and their ability to cope with these shocks, including weather shocks. In order to be able to use the survey for this work on migration in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, additional questions as well as more options within existing questions were added to the questionnaire on household perceptions regarding changes in climate, and whether this affected migration decisions.
Apart from a range of household and individual characteristics which are used as controls in the regression analysis, a few central questions are used for the analysis presented in this chapter. In section 6A about the incidence of shocks and household responses, households are asked whether since November 2004, the respondent or a member of the household experienced various shocks. The shocks listed are: (1) Weather shocks (Droughts; floods; Pest infestation, crop and livestock diseases); (2) Unexpected increase in prices of food or other essential commodities consumed; (3) Unexpected loss of job; (4) Involuntary reduction in employment or the number of hours worked; (5) Unexpected decline in prices or demand for products that you sell; (6) Unexpected increase in prices or shortages of inputs or products needed for your activity; (7) Loss of asset or of livestock due to theft, death, or accident; (8) Cut-off or decrease in remittances to household; (9) Death of main earner for the household; (10) Death of another member of the family; (11) Serious injury or illness that kept any member from doing normal activities; (12) Divorce or abandonment by husband; (13) Big amount of dowry for daughter's marriage; (14) Other (specify). This is the information used in the regression analysis to assess the impact of weather shocks on migration controlling for a range of other independent variables.
Data on migration is available for all household members, both those who remain today members of the households, and those who used to be members but have left permanently. We can thus measure both temporary and permanent migration by household members. On the other hand, we only record the migration of household members, as opposed to that of whole households, but this should not be too much of a problem given that most migration is typically undertaken by household members, instead of entire households. It must also be recognized that it is difficult to distinguish the separate effects of climate change, environmental change, and weather shocks on households, and to separate shortterm versus long-term household responses. What the questionnaire provides us with is information on whether households declare having been affected by a weather shock--but the decision to migrate is probably based on repeated shocks or changing conditions, as opposed to a single shock, and we cannot verify to what extent the declarations of households correspond closely to actual weather data for their area. But on the other hand one could argue that decisions such as
that of migrating are influenced at least as much by perceptions of households of weather patterns as by the weather patterns themselves.
While all households respond to the question of whether they suffered from a weather shock, in a separate part of the questionnaire households working in agriculture are asked whether they were faced with a number problems in the last five years. The list of problems identified was as follows: (1) Reduction in agricultural yields due to inadequate rainfall (periodic and recurrent water scarcity due to droughts); (2) Reduction in agricultural yields due to too much water (too much rain or flooding); (3) Poor soil quality due to erosion reducing agricultural yields; (4) Changing and unpredictable climate and temperatures reducing agricultural yields (that is, too hot, too cold, too rainy, too dry); (5) Pest or locust infestation reducing agricultural yields; (6) Reduced job opportunities in the agricultural sector; (7) Death of livestock due to bad weather conditions; (8) Reduction in the stock of livestock since the availability of grazing land is becoming less due to droughts and floods. Next households were asked: ""How serious was the financial loss to the household due to these climate related factors listed above?"" The potential answers were very serious, moderate, serious, and negligible. Finally households were asked ""Was (the household) forced to change the economic activity after the shock?"" This information will also be used in the regression analysis as some problems encountered by agricultural households-- who tend to be more exposed to climate shocks--may lead to migration and the problems identified in the questionnaire may potentially better capture changes in structural environmental conditions than a weather shock would.

Basic Statistics
Table 10.1 provides summary statistics on the main variables of interest. The first two columns of the table give the migration rates observed for the various groups of households or individuals. The last two tables provide the summary statistics for the same variables as they are used in the regression analysis--note that in a number of cases the summary statistics are missing and replaced by the symbol ""--"" because these are the excluded reference categories in the regressions (the shares of those with that dummy variable can be readily computed from the other shares for the corresponding category of variables). In what follows, we focus the discussion of the basic statistics on the migration rates, while the summary statistics are provided simply for the sake of completeness in information and standard practice.
The temporary migration rate is at 5.71 percent for the sample as a whole, and is a bit higher than the permanent migration rate, at 4.00 percent. The temporary migration rate is at its highest level among individuals aged 25­34, while for permanent migration, the rate is highest among those aged 15­24. The older an individual gets, the less likely it is that s/he will migrate. Migration rates are much higher for women than for men, and this is confirmed when looking at the position of the individual in terms of being a head of household or a spouse (rates for spouses are much higher), or at the interaction effects between gender and marital status.
In general, and especially in the case of permanent migration, migration rates are higher among the better educated. This is observed whether one looks at the education level of the individuals, or at that of the household heads. Migration rates also tend to be higher among households whose heads is self-employed, which would include small business owners. There are also higher among individuals belonging to a household with little hand, possibly because there is less pressure to stay at the place of origin in order to work the land. Temporary migration is especially high among poorer households as measured through an index of wealth, while permanent migration is slightly higher among both the bottom and the top quintiles.
Migration rates are higher among household located in urban areas, which may indicate substantial migration from smaller to larger areas as well as international migration from urban centers. There are also large differences in migration rates depending of the regions where households live. The highest temporary migration rate is observed in Souss-Massa-Draâ,, followed by Marrakech-TensiftAl Haouz, Taza-Al Hoceima-Taounate, Doukala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, and Gharb-Cherarda-Béni Hssen. For permanent migration, the highest rates are observed from Tadla-Azilal, Méknès-Tafilalet, Souss-Massa-Draâ,, and GuélmimEs Semara.
When looking at migration rates according to whether households have been exposed to weather and other types of shocks, it is remarkable to note that migration rates are essentially always higher among households who were not affected by negative shocks. This does not mean that shocks, including weather shocks, may not be correlated with migration in a multivariate setting, but it does suggest that overall, in the country as a whole, much of the migration that is taking place may not be primarily related to weather shocks.
A similar message emerges from the data provided in table 10.2 on the reasons declared by households for the migration of household members. For temporary migration, the main motivation by far is the fact that better offers of agriculture employment are available at the place of destination-this is the rationale for half of all temporary migrants. The same reason is mentioned for permanent migration, although in that case marriage is mentioned more often. The lack of jobs at the place of origin is mentioned, and it could be related to adverse weather conditions. It could also be that the availability of better agricultural employment at the place of destination is related to the effect of climate change and droughts at the place of origin. But this cannot simply be assumed given that being a victim of a drought or a flood is explicitly listed among the potential reasons to migrate in the questionnaire, and that very few households declare that these were the main reasons for the migration decisions of their members.

Correlates of the Probability of Migration The basic statistics presented in the previous section appear to suggest that migration rates are lower in areas affected by extreme weather shocks. This does not mean however that weather shocks have a negative impact on migration. For
xample, a positive association was found between education and the likelihood of migration. If migration is lower among households affected by weather and other shocks, this might simply reflect the fact that these households tend to live in rural areas, work in agriculture, and be less well educated. Controlling for education, it could very well be that weather shocks could have a positive effect on migration. In order to assess the marginal impact of weather and other shocks on migration after controlling for a range of individual and household characteristics, this section provides a regression analysis of the likelihood of temporary and permanent migration in a multivariate setting. The analysis is still descriptive, but it enables us to assess whether controlling for individual and household characteristics as well as broad levels of geographic location, adverse weather shocks have a statistically significant effect on migration, whether positive or negative.
Table 10.3 provides the results of probit regressions (with robust standard errors) for the correlates of the probability of migrating either temporarily or permanently. Note that in the case of permanent migration, only migration for reasons not related to marriage is considered. Two different specifications for the model are provided-- the second specification includes a series of additional household level variables which are not included in the first because of the risk of endogeneity with those variables in that, for example, migration may affect who is considered as the household head, or the education level of the household head. This risk of endogeneity is much larger in the case of permanent migration, but for comparison purposes the two models are estimated for both regressions. Marginal effects are provided (dF/dX), so that a value of 0.02 would represent an increase in the likelihood of migration of two percentage points.

The main variables of interest are at the bottom of table 10.3, and we start the discussion with those. Being subject to an adverse weather shock appears to increase the probability of temporary migration depending on the specification, but not the probability of permanent migration. It looks like household members are coping with weather shocks (which might be one-time events) by looking for work elsewhere, but that these conditions do not yet lead to permanent departures. However, a reduction in agricultural yields due to less water increases permanent migration, suggesting that when the changes in environmental conditions are perceived to be more permanent, some household members do feel the need to migrate permanently. By contrast, a reduction in agricultural yields du
to excess water (probably through floods) reduces the likelihood of migrating temporarily, possibly because the shocks may reduce the resources available to household members to migrate, and such shocks are not as likely to be perceived as permanent changes in conditions that affect long-term livelihood.
Unexpected increases in prices of food and others basic commodities also lead to more temporary migration, but the effect is only marginally significant in one of the two specifications, so one could argue that there is no clear effect. Finally, the largest effect on both temporary and permanent migration comes from being affected by a cut-off or decrease in remittances from previous household members who had migrated. This decrease in remittances leads to a large increase in both types of migration, suggesting a certain level of dependence on remittances among the households receiving them since they send other members away when this is the case (note that the ability to send new members away may be facilitated by network effects that having other members who migrated before entail).
Apart from shocks, a number of individual level characteristics affect the probability of migration. Younger individuals are more likely to migrate permanently, given that they have often not yet created a household at the place of origin, but age does not affect the probability of temporary migration in the same way. Better educated individuals appear to be more likely to migrate temporarily, but not permanently. Those who are married are more likely to migrate temporarily, but this is essentially the case for men who are heads of households, while married head are less likely to migrate permanently. As to household level characteristics, temporary migration is more frequent among members for the poorest households (bottom quintile of wealth), but the differences are less systematic for permanent migration. Whether households own more than one acre of land or not does not make much difference after controlling for other variables. Households where the head does not have work are more likely to have temporary migrants.
While the urban versus rural location of the household does not have a statistically significant impact on the probability to migrate, there are geographic effects at work after controlling for individual and household characteristics. The reference geographic location in the regression model is the prefecture of TangerTéÈtouhan, which is located in the tip of the northern part of the country toward Spain. In comparison to that region, temporary migration is lower in Oriental, Grand-Casablanca, Méknès-Tafilalet, and Fès-Boulemane, and higher in SoussMassa-Draâ,. Again in comparison to Tanger-Tétouhan, permanent migration is lower in Chaouia-Ouardigha, Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz, and Fès-Boulemane, and higher in Tadla-Azilal.

Conclusion
Do extreme weather events such as droughts or floods lead to migration away from the areas affected by these events in Morocco? The analysis presented in this chapter suggests that this is the case. While droughts and floods are not directly identified by households as major reasons for migration, the characteris-
tics of areas affected by droughts, such as insufficient agricultural revenue and employment are mentioned as reasons for migration by households. Furthermore, in regression analysis, being subject to an adverse weather shock appears to increase the probability of temporary migration, and a reduction in agricultural yields due to less water (droughts) increases permanent migration. Other factors do have a larger effect on the probability of migration, so that climate and environment related variables may not be the main drivers of temporary and permanent migration. But they do appear to contribute to migration.
CHAPTER 11
Do Remittances Reach Households Living in Unfavorable Climate Areas? Evidence from the Republic of Yemen
George Joseph, Quentin Wodon, and Brian Blankespoor

There is evidence in the literature that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate shocks, so that both may function as coping mechanisms. It is not clear however whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of weather shocks. This chapter uses a nationally representative household survey for the Republic of Yemen combined with weather data to measure remittance flows, both domestic and international, and assess the likelihood of households receiving remittances as well as the amounts received. We are interested in testing whether households living in less favorable areas in terms of climate (as measured through higher temperatures, lower rainfalls, more variability or seasonality in both, and larger differences in a given year between extreme temperatures) are more likely to benefit from remittances. The results suggest that this does not seem to be the case in the Republic of Yemen.
Introduction
Cross-country and country studies suggest that migration and remittances tend to increase in response to climate and other shocks, with remittances helping households to cope with the effect of the shocks (World Bank 2006). While private international capital flows tend to dry up after such shocks, remittance flows tend to increase or at least remain stable after natural disasters, as well as macroeconomic or financial crises and armed conflicts (for example, Clarke and Wallsten 2004; Weiss, Fagen and Bump 2005; World Bank 2006). Yang (2007) provides cross-country evidence on the response of international financial flows to hurricanes, and concludes that for poorer countries, increased hurricane exposure is associated with greater remittance flows. In the Caribbean, a 1 percent decrease in real gross domestic product may be associated with a 3 percent increase in migrant remittances with a two-year lag (Mishra 2005).


Do Remittances Reach Households Living in Unfavorable Climate Areas?

Evidence from household surveys also indicates that households use both migration and remittances as coping strategies in response to climate shocks. Migration flows increased in the aftermath of disasters in Jamaica in 1989, after hurricane Gilbert and in Central America in 1998, and after hurricane Mitch (Wisner 2003). In El Salvador, an agricultural shock increases the probability of migration of a household member to the United States by 24.3 percent (Halliday 2006). Studies using household survey data also confirm the consumption smoothing role played by remittances in recipient households (Quartey and Blankson 2004). Yang and Choi (2007) show for the Philippines that remittances help to compensate for nearly 65 percent of the loss in income due to rainfall shocks. Increased remittances helped to smooth household consumption and compensate for the loss of assets after an earthquake in El Salvador in 2001 (Halliday 2006). A survey of households in four villages in Pakistan after the devastating earthquake in 2005 reveals that migrant remittances were important factors in disaster recovery and reconstruction (Suleri and Savage 2006). Remittance-receiving households in the Aceh region of Indonesia were found to have recovered faster from the 2004 Tsunami because of immediate relief provided by migrant remittances, although remittance transfers were adversely affected due to the disruption of financial services and informal remittance transfer channels (Wu 2006). Konseiga (2007) finds evidence of migration to Cote d'Ivoire and resulting remittances used as a survival strategy in drought prone areas in North Eastern Burkina Faso.
Despite the emerging consensus in the literature that migration and remittances are indeed part of an overall livelihood strategy by which households try to insure against shocks in disaster prone regions, there is less evidence on whether households use migration and receive remittances as part of a livelihood strategy in regions prone to slow onset disasters, or more generally adverse weather conditions as opposed to specific climate shocks. Said differently, it is not clear whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate in the absence of specific major climate shocks. On the one hand, households in such areas often are poorer and thus need support, which may be an incentive for migrants to remit. But such households also have limited means to send migrants away, especially internationally, and thus may not benefit from as large flows of remittances than households living in regions with better climate. In addition, migrants from unfavorable climate regions are also less likely to be well educated and may thus have lower earning potential, which may in turn limit their ability to remit.
By combining a nationally representative household survey with climate and geographic data, this chapter tests whether in the Republic of Yemen remittance flows, both domestic and international, benefit more those households located in areas with unfavorable climate than households living in better climate areas. This is done both with and without controls for household characteristics that may affect remittances, but may also be endogenous--a fact that is often brushed aside in empirical work on remittances.
The Republic of Yemen is an interesting case study for such work, given that it is highly vulnerable to the vagaries of weather. This is suggested not only by
historical patterns of climatic variability, but also by extreme levels of water scarcity and high economic reliance on water dependent sectors such as agriculture and fisheries. The topography of the country is highly diverse, with coastal plains where the population is concentrated, a mountainous interior, and upland deserts to the north toward the Saudi Arabia border. Annual precipitation in many parts of the country is low, although much higher in the western mountainous highland region. Temperatures are high, with more than occasional extreme values, but they also vary a lot across areas and over the year. While climate models do not all agree on how the Republic of Yemen's climate is expected to change, there is agreement that temperatures are likely to rise, while rainfall will fall. Due to near complete depletion of groundwater resources, agricultural output is projected to decrease by 4 percent in the next two decades (World Bank 2010). For households who will remain in areas with unfavorable climate, the ability to rely on remittances may well therefore be crucial for their livelihoods. Looking at current patterns of remittances is one way to assess whether the hope of steady and substantial remittances flows for households living in ""climate-poor"" areas is realistic.
The chapter is structured as follows. Section two presents the data and methodology. Section three presents the estimation of models for the likelihood of receiving remittances and the amounts received, both for domestic and international remittances. A conclusion follows.

Data and Methodology
We use the most recently available nationally representative household budget survey implemented in the Republic of Yemen, whose data were collected in 2005/06. The survey includes 13,136 households (98,941 individuals) living in 309 of the country's 333 districts. Apart from the location of households, the survey provides information on a wide range of socioeconomic characteristics including among others demographics, education, health and anthropometrics, employment and occupation, consumption and assets, and income including remittances. Data are available on both domestic and international remittances.
Beyond the household survey, and based on the location of households proxied through the most populous city in the district in which the household lives, we also use information on the distance between the household/district location and the coast, as well as the distance to the nearest airport. These distances are calculated using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 software. We also use measures of travel time to the nearest city with a population of at least 100,000 using a methodology developed from Nelson (2008) with regionally specific information (World Bank 2011). The percentage of irrigated land is taken from Global Map of Irrigated Areas version 4 (Siebert et al. 2005; Siebert, Hoogeveen, and Frenken 2006). Weather district-level data on annual mean temperature and rainfall and their variability/seasonality are collected from BIOCLIM (Busby 1991). All weather variables are computed on observations for the period 1990­2000. We also include in some specifications governorate
dummy variables to control for additional geographic effects operating at a higher level of aggregation than the district.
The estimation method-a standard Heckman (1979) selection model-- enables us to look at both the likelihood of receiving remittances, and the amount of remittances received. Estimations are provided for domestic and international remittances separately. The Heckman specification allows to control for potential selectivity in who receives remittances. It is however not easy find a variable that affects the probability of receiving remittances and not their amount. One candidate could be the leave-out-mean likelihood of receiving remittances (domestic or international) in the district in which the household lives, which reflects migration networks. However, while this variable certainly affects the likelihood of migrating, it may also affect the amount of remittances received by households. For example, it could be that larger networks may be associated with better employment opportunities at destination, which can, in turn, influence the amounts of remittances sent by the migrants (Munshi 2003). On the other hand, it could also be that if more migrants are coming to destination areas, they may compete for the same jobs and thereby benefit from lower wages which might reduce the amounts of remittances they are able to send back home. Also, even if networks only influence migration costs and not wages at destination, they might still influence the demand for remittances in migrant-sending households (Carrington, Detragiache, and Vishwanath 1996; McKenzie and Rapoport 2010). For this reason, the leave-out-mean is included in our analysis in both the probit on whether households receive remittances, and in the levels regression for the amount of remittances received by households, with the Heckman model simply identified through the nonlinearity in the probit equation.
Table 11.1 provides summary statistics for the variables used in the estimations. Out of the total number of households (13,136), 12,987 are used for the estimation due to missing values for some variables. The number of households receiving remittances is 5,334 (43.63 percent when using sample weights), of which 4,019 (33.90 percent) receive domestic remittances, and 1,920 (14.10 percent) receive international remittances, and 605 (4.38 percent) receive both. 7,653 households (56.37 percent) do not receive any remittances. The average amount of remittances received among households who receive domestic remittances is YER 46,654 (US$252 at the average exchange rate in 2004 of US$1 = YER 185), while the average amount for international remittances is as expected significantly higher, at YER 218,786 (US$1,183). Given low standards of wellbeing in the country, these are rather substantial transfers.
Based on the basic statistics provided in table 11.1, a few facts are worth pointing out. First, the differences in the characteristics of households receiving domestic and international remittances are smaller than one might have expected based on experience in other low income countries (see for example Hildebrandt and McKenzie 2005). Households receiving international remittances are ""better off"" in many dimensions (such as poverty status, education of the household head, land cultivation status, and so on), but not by a whole lot. For example, poverty measures are lower among households receiving
international remittances, but the differences are smaller than one might have expected. In general, the fact that poverty measures are relatively high among both domestic and international migrants suggests that migration is likely for the most part to be unskilled (this is related to the relatively low skills employment opportunities that are available for international migrants in nearby oil producing countries of the Gulf region, and especially neighboring Saudi Arabia). In terms of weather variables characterizing the areas in which households live, the differences between households receiving remittances, whether domestic or international, and the national sample are also small.
Turning to the regression methodology, it is important to start by pointing out that in many papers on the determinants of remittances using household survey data, a number of household level variables are included in the correlates. This is however often problematic, because most of the household level correlates are at risk of being endogenous. Consider the correlates included in tables 11.2 and 11.3. Whether the household head has a given level of education depends on who the household head is. When households receive remittances, it is typically because they have one or more migrants, and this may well include the household head. This is the case when the husband or father has left the family either temporarily or for a longer period of time in order to increase his earnings through better employment, and thereby help the family members back at home through remittances. In that case, if the wife is then considered as the household head at home in the survey, given that her level of education is often likely to be lower, the level of education of the head depends on the decision of the husband to migrate and send remittances, and is thus endogenous.
The same problem arises, albeit probably in a more diluted way, with the shares of household members above the age of 21 that have various levels of education. But more generally, the type of occupation of the household members at home, and whether they cultivate land, own livestock, or have debts, may all be endogenous. If one were to include additional variables (as is often done) such as poverty status or quintiles of well-being based on consumption, this would clearly depend on the remittances received (or lack thereof). Even if this often ignored in the applied survey-based literature in the drivers of migration and remittances, it is in general difficult to find household socioeconomic characteristics that are truly exogenous to the decision of some household members to migrate and send remittances. And while some of these problems are alleviated when the household survey has information on members that were part of the household but have left (see for example Binzel and Assaad 2011), this is not the case for most surveys, and such information is not available in our data.
This being said, in this chapter our main interest is less on how household level correlates affect whether they receive remittances or not, than on whether remittances reach households that are located in areas with comparatively unfavorable climate. This is why we include in the correlates a large number of district-level variables that were merged with the household survey data and that account for weather (temperature and rainfall), irrigated land characteristics, and location of the districts in which households live. We have quite a few

district-level variables, and much more so than is typically found in the literature, as well as higher level governorate dummies. Therefore we have the possibility of estimating at least somewhat meaningful models even without household characteristics, even though it must be clear that one could argue that it is problematic to try to explain household level variations with mostly geographic variables. If one considers the models without household level variables as a test for robustness of the results obtained with the model with household controls, then the procedure enables us to test whether the partial correlations observed between remittances and district-level characteristics are indeed robust to the inclusion of household controls or not. To the extent that the results are robust, we can be more confident in the results obtained for the geographic effects. As we will show, the fact that the sign, magnitude, and statistical significance of most of the district-level variables do not change much whether we include household level correlates or not is a good sign of the validity of the estimates for the district-level variables which are the focus of this chapter.

Results
Tables 11.2 and 11.3 provide the regression estimates (Heckman model) for the likelihood of receiving domestic and international remittances, respectively, as well as the amounts received. This is done with and without regional (governorate) variables as additional controls. The coefficients of the regional dummies are not reported here to save space, but they are available upon request and many of them are statistically significant. Differences in results in the specifications with and without governorate dummies tend to be small.
Consider first the results for domestic remittances without the household level controls in order to focus on the district-level variables. Districts with more irrigated land are less likely to receive remittances. Apart from the migration network variable which has a strong effect on the probability of receiving remittances and several regional dummies that are not shown in the table, this is the only variable for which a statistically significant effect is observed in the probit when no household controls are included.1 One explanation might be that there is less need for households to send migrants away when more land is available for cultivation, which would reduce remittances. As for the amounts of domestic remittances received, the coefficients of the many of the weather variables are statistically significant either in the specifications with or without regional dummies, and in several cases in both specifications. The coefficients for three of the five weather variables (and their squared values when applicable) suggest that domestic remittances are lower in districts with unfavorable climate. This is the case for higher temperatures (negative impact with regional dummies), higher levels of precipitation (positive impact without regional dummies), and larger differences between minimum and maximum temperatures (negative impact without regional dummies). The coefficients for precipitation seasonality are not statistically significant. The only weather variable which suggests more remittances in climate poor areas is temperature seasonality, for which a higher value
is associated with higher remittances. But one could argue that this is counteracted to some extent through the negative correlation between the amount of domestic remittances received and the difference between the maximum and minimum temperature.
This suggests that unfavorable climate is associated with lower amounts of domestic remittances. We are of course not claiming that climate itself necessarily influences the amounts of remittances received. The mechanisms at work may be much more complex, and are likely to be related in part to the fact that households living in districts with unfavorable climate may be poorer and less educated. In that case, even when households are able to afford the cost of sending migrants (the weather variables where not statistically significant in the probits), the migrants may not be able to send back as large remittances as is the case for migrants from other areas. This is only a speculation, but whatever the reasons for the findings, the fact is that districts with structural disadvantages in terms of their climate receive less domestic remittances. The fact that many of the effects vanish when including regional dummies is not too surprising, given that weather patterns differ between regions, so this does not invalidate the results.
Consider next international remittances. The likelihood of receiving remittances is again lower in districts with a higher share of irrigated land, probably for the same reason as mentioned before. Higher temperatures are also associated with a lower probability of receiving international remittances (this is observed with regional dummies and the positive sign for the quadratic term does not affect the overall sign of the effect.) There is a positive effect on the probability of receiving remittances for the squared value of precipitation but this is only marginally statistically significant. Turning to the amounts received, two of the weather variables have a negative impact: higher temperatures lead to lower amounts received in the specification without regional dummies, and more precipitation seasonality reduces the amounts of remittances in the two specifications with and without regional dummies. In the case of the specification with regional dummies, temperature seasonality is associated with more remittances, but this is the only case where indicators of poorer weather lead to more remittances. The upshot is that overall, households in districts with less favorable climate also tend to be less likely to receive international remittances, and when they do, the amounts received tend to be lower, as observed with domestic remittances.
Do these results remain when adding household level controls? They do, and remarkably so, not only in terms of sign and magnitude, but also in terms of statistical significance. In the case of domestic remittances, all results for the weather variables remain virtually the same when household level controls are added. In the case of international remittances, stability is also observed in most cases, with two exceptions. First, the effect of temperature seasonality on the amounts received in the specification with regional dummies vanishes when household controls are added. Second, the effect of precipitation on the probability of receiving remittances becomes statistically significant in the specification
without regional dummies when household controls are added. These two changes both go in the way of our conclusion, which is that climate poor areas are less likely to receive remittances and when they do, receive less of them.
Beyond climatic variables, the other district variables (apart from the leaveout-means) which measure isolation of the districts also have an impact on domestic remittances, but not on international remittances, and the effects are robust to the inclusion of household controls. For domestic remittances, being further away from an airport increases the likelihood of receiving domestic remittances, perhaps because international travel is more difficult. Being further away from an airport or a port also increases the amount of remittances received, possibly for the same reason. But being away from a large city reduces domestic remittances, perhaps because of fewer well paying employment opportunities for domestic migrants in nearby districts.
Finally, for the sake of completeness, it is worth briefly discussing the results for the household controls, even if they must be treated with caution due to the risk of endogeneity. Households in rural areas are as likely to receive remittances as households in urban areas in most cases, but they tend to receive lower amounts, as expected. A higher level of education is associated with both a lower likelihood of receiving remittances, and a lower amount of remittances received--the effects tend to be more often statistically significant for the household head than for the share of household members above the age of 21. The effect on the probability to migrate may reflect the fact that much of the Republic of Yemen's migration is unskilled, and the effects on the amounts of remittances received may be linked to the fact that households whose members have higher education levels may need remittances less. Households cultivating land are less likely to receive domestic remittances, probably because there is less of a need for members to leave, but are more likely to receive international remittances, perhaps because of a higher ability to pay for the cost of international migration. Households with debts are more likely to benefit from domestic remittances, but the reverse is observed for international remittances. As to the correlation between indebtedness and amounts, it is negative for both forms of remittances. Different rationale might be provided for such results, but again endogeneity may be an issue. As for network effects, when the effects are statistically significant they tend as already mentioned to increase the probability of receiving remittances, but they are negatively correlated with the amount of remittances received for both domestic and international remittances. This would be consistent with a story emphasizing the competition between a larger number of migrants for limited job opportunities (especially in a context of substantial unemployment), which would then reduce the amounts of remittances that they are able to send back home.

Conclusion The literature suggests that migrant remittance flows increase in the aftermath of natural disasters, macroeconomic or financial crises, and act as a safety net for
households that have migrants either within or outside the country. Furthermore, there is an emerging consensus that migration and remittances are part of an overall livelihood strategy by which households try to insure against shocks in regions which are prone to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions. Less is known however on whether remittances are likely to be higher in areas that suffer from poor climate more generally, in the absence of specific weather shocks. Assessing whether this is the case is however difficult, because data from household surveys are rarely combined with weather data in order to test the impact of climate on remittance patterns.
Using the Republic of Yemen's latest nationally representative multipurpose household survey as well as detailed district-level weather and other data, we have tried to assess whether households living in areas with higher temperatures and lower rainfalls, as well as more variability or seasonality in both, are more likely to benefit from remittances than households living in districts with more favorable climate. The results suggest that in the Republic of Yemen, both the likelihood of receiving remittances and the amounts of remittances received tend to be lower in districts with unfavorable climate. The effects are especially strong for domestic remittances. This suggests in turn that in areas with unfavorable climate, the ability of household to rely on remittances for their livelihoods or to cope with shocks may be more limited than one might have hoped.
CHAPTER 12
Does the Impact of Remittances on Poverty and Human Development Depend on the Climate of Receiving Areas?
George Joseph and Quentin Wodon

This chapter uses matching techniques and a recent nationally representative household survey for Yemen combined with weather data to measure the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes (school enrolment, immunization, and malnutrition). The estimations are carried both nationally and in areas with favorable and unfavorable climate. Remittances are found to have a statistically significant impact on many of the indicators, and this is especially the case for international remittances which tend to provide more resources to their beneficiaries. The impact of remittances on measures of poverty and malnutrition is also found to be stronger in districts that are affected by unfavorable climate (as measured through higher temperatures or lower levels of rainfall), while the impact of remittances on school enrollment is found to be stronger in areas with better climate. The results are consistent with households in the least favorable areas using their remittances to meet basic needs first, while households in better areas can use remittances flows for education investments.

Introduction
Migration of household members and the potential resulting remittances are part of livelihood strategies used by households to insure against shocks in regions which are prone to natural disasters and adverse weather conditions. There is ample evidence that migration and especially remittances may reduce poverty and improve human development outcomes for receiving households. According to Mansuri (2007), school enrollment rates increase by 54 percent for girls in migrant households in rural Pakistan (the increase is lower for boys at seven percent). Frank and Hummer (2002) find that infants born into Mexico-to-US migrant households have better birth outcomes: while nine percent of infants in

international migrant households have low birth weights, 11 percent of those in nonmigrant households have this condition. Hildebrandt and McKenzie (2005) and McKenzie (2006) suggest that international migration has positive effects on both infant mortality and child weight among Mexican households.
Remittance-receiving households typically have better asset ownership and are more entrepreneurial. Taylor and Mora (2006) suggest that international migrant households have the largest marginal budget share for investments in rural Mexico. Makdissi and Wodon (2004) suggest that households with migrants have better housing. Osili (2004) shows that in Nigeria, a ten percent increase in migrants' income increases the probability of investing in housing by three percentage points in the country of origin. Remittances also help to smooth consumption during adverse shocks--both through ex ante preparedness and ex post adaptation.
Controlling for the endogeneity of the remittance-receiving status of households, remittances help to smooth consumption after floods in Bangladesh and build disaster resilient housing in Ghana and Burkina Faso and ensure sufficient liquidity during food shortage in Ethiopia (Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha 2011). Gubert (2007) finds that households in rural Mali use remittances to insure themselves against adverse shocks, with a 500 kilogram drop in grain output leading to a 48 percent increase in remittances; if that drop in grain output is coupled with a death in the family, remittances rise by 124 percent.
There is also evidence that migration and remittances reduce poverty. Lokshin, Bontch-Osmolovski, and Glinskaya (2007) show that in Nepal almost 20 percent of the decline in poverty between 1995 and 2004 was linked to migration. Adams and Page (2005) suggest that a ten percent increase in per capita international remittances leads to a 3.5 percent decline in the share of people in poverty. International remittances reduce poverty in Latin America by 0.4 percent for each percentage point increase in the remittances to GDP ratio (Acosta et al. 2007). Conversely, a drop in international remittances may lead to higher poverty, as observed in Burkina Faso after the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire reduced the ability of migrants to remit (Siaens and Wodon 2011).
The question investigated in this chapter is somewhat different. We are interested in assessing whether the impact of remittances on poverty and human development indicators depends on the areas in which households live. Our hypothesis is that remittances may have a larger impact in areas affected by unfavorable climate because it is in those areas that households tend to be most vulnerable. By combining climate and household survey data from Yemen, we test whether domestic and international remittances reduce poverty and improve education and malnutrition indicators more in areas with high temperatures and low rainfalls.
Yemen is an interesting case study for this work. First, it has high levels of migration, both domestic and international, and as a result many households do benefit from remittances. In the nationally representative household survey for 2006 that we use for the analysis, 43.63 percent of the population benefits from either domestic or international remittances (the proportions are 33.90 percent

for domestic remittances, 14.10 percent for international remittances, and 4.38 percent for both.) Yemen's topography is diverse, with a mountainous core at the center, coastal plains in the east, west, and south, and upland deserts to the north, toward the Saudi Arabia border. The country suffers from a relatively harsh climate in many areas. Rainfall is limited and the population must deal with high levels of water scarcity as well as persisting economic reliance on water dependent sectors such as rainfed agriculture. The average annual mean temperature is 22 degrees Celsius in our data from BIOCLIM, but there are large differences between various parts of the country as well as over the year, and temperatures have peaked to well above 50 degrees. Climate change is likely to progressively bring in even higher temperatures and lower rainfalls in the future. Climate is not only likely to play an important role in decisions by household members to migrate and remit, but it is also likely to affect poverty and human development outcomes both directly and indirectly through its impact on livelihoods. In turn, as a coping mechanism, the impact of remittances may differ between areas.
The chapter is structured as follows. Section two presents the data and methodology. Section three presents the results from the estimation of the impact of remittances, both domestic and international, on poverty and human development outcomes. A conclusion follows.

Data and Methodology
We use the most recently available nationally representative household budget survey implemented in Yemen, whose data were collected in 2005/06. The survey includes 13,136 households (98,941 individuals) living in 309 of the country's 333 districts. Apart from the location of households, the survey provides information on a wide range of socioeconomic characteristics including among others demographics, education, health and anthropometrics, employment and occupation, consumption and assets, and income including remittances. Data are available on both domestic and international remittances, with 43.6 percent of households receiving some form of remittances (33.9 percent for domestic remittances and 4.38 percent for international sources, and some overlap between both; we treat households receiving remittances from domestic and international sources as international remittance receiving households.)
Beyond the household survey, and based on the location of households proxied through the most populous city in the district in which the household lives, we also use information on the distance between the household/district location and the coast, as well as the distance to the nearest airport; these distances are calculated using an Euclidean distance function in ESRI ArcGIS 9.3 software. We also use measures of travel time to the nearest city with 100,000 populations using a methodology developed from Nelson (2008) with regionally specific information (World Bank 2011). The percentage of irrigated land is taken from Global Map of Irrigated Areas version 4 (Siebert et al. 2005; Siebert, Hoogeveen, and Frenken 2006). Weather data on annual mean temperature and rainfall and
their variability are collected from BIOCLIM (Busby 1991). All weather variables are computed on observations for the period 1990 to 2000.
The estimation method--a standard matching procedure--enables us to look at the impact of remittances on a range of outcomes. These include the poverty status of the household (based on consumption per equivalent adult), as well as education enrollment for children below the age of 15, immunization for children below the age of 5, and malnutrition. Using standardized z scores for height for age, weight for age and body mass index, and based on World Health Organization (1995) guidelines, all children whose height for age and weight for age z score is less than ­2 are deemed stunted and wasted respectively; similarly, all children whose body mass index is less than 16 are deemed as underweight (grade 3 thinness). The logit regressions used for the matching procedure are available upon request, with some examples provided in the appendix--care was applied to make sure that balancing properties were respected. We used k-nearest neighbors matching, with k equal to 4, a radius of 0.02, and we excluded the one percent of observations with extreme values for the indicators of interest.

Results
In principle, we would expect remittances to have a potentially large impact on poverty and human development indicators. The average transfer received by households who benefit from domestic remittances is YER 46,654 (US$252 at the average exchange rate in 2004 of US$1 = YER 185), and the average amount for international remittances is as expected significantly higher, at YER 218,786 (US$1,183). Given rather low standards of well-being in the country as a whole, these are substantial transfers which should make a difference for households.
Tables 12.1­12.3 provide the results from the matching for all, domestic, and international remittances, respectively. Consider first table 12.1, which accounts for any type of remittances received, whether domestic or international. Using a cut-off point for t-statistics of 1.96 corresponding to a 95 percent confidence interval, the impact of remittances is statistically significant at the national level for six variables: the three poverty measures (for example, with a reduction of six points for the headcount index from 28.71 percent to 22.81 percent), male and female school enrollment (increase of three points for boys and two points for girls), and stunting (reduction of two points).
Note that statistical significance is easier to obtain at the national level than for subsets of the districts, given the larger number of observations available at the national level. For our purpose, the interesting comparison is between districts with high or low temperatures, as well as between districts with high and low levels of rainfall. Specifically, we will consider the top 20 percent districts with high temperature and the bottom 20 percent districts in terms of rainfall, and compare these groups with respectively the bottom 20 percent districts in terms of temperatures and the top 20 percent districts in terms of rainfall. Our prior is that we expect larger impacts of remittances in districts with high temperatures or low levels of rainfall.

or high rainfall, there are even more differences. In districts with low rainfall, the effects of remittances are statistically significant for the same five measures as observed in the case of high temperatures. By contrast, in districts with high rainfall, the effect of remittances is statistically significant for none of these indicators, but it is for male and female school enrollment. Taking both statistical significance and the magnitude of the effects when they are statistically significant, the results suggest that remittances have a larger impact on poverty and especially nutrition measures in areas affected by more difficult climate, while in areas with better climate (especially higher rainfall), education gains tend to be larger.
Similar results tend to be observed in tables 12.2 and 12.3 when considering domestic and international remittances separately, although there are differences between the impacts of both types of remittances. One would expect that for households benefitting from remittances, the impacts on the various indicators would be larger in the case of international remittances simply because the average level of international remittances among beneficiaries is much higher than the average level of domestic remittances among beneficiaries. This is indeed observed through the fact that at the national level, for example, impacts are statistically significant for only three indicators with domestic remittances (the three poverty measures), while impacts are statistically significant for seven indicators in the case of international remittances (the three poverty measures, as well as school enrollment for both boys and girls, and stunting and wasting).
But what about the comparison between districts in terms of climate? Consider first domestic remittances. When looking at temperatures, apart from the results for the poverty measures which tend to be similar in both sets of districts, we see that for domestic remittances, there is a statistically significant impact of remittances on stunting in districts with high temperatures, while this is not the case for districts with low temperatures. (There is also a curious reduction in male immunization with remittances in high temperatures districts-but
this is the only case of unexpected result, and the only time that the effect is statistically significant for immunization, so one can probably discount that observation). When looking at rainfall, we see that the effects on poverty are statistically significant for two of the poverty measures in low rainfall areas, while this is not the case in high rainfall areas. As for education, we see a (marginally) statistically significant gain in school enrollment for boys in areas with low rainfall, while there is a gain for girls in areas with high rainfall. Still, overall, the evidence points to a larger impact of domestic remittances in districts with either high temperatures or low rainfall.
This is also observed for international remittances, especially when comparing districts with low and high temperatures. In districts with low temperatures, the impact of international remittances is statistically significant for school enrollment only, while in districts with high temperatures, the impacts are statistically significant for the poverty measures, school enrollment for boys, and the three measures of malnutrition. The differences in impact are lower when comparing districts with high and low levels of rainfall--there the impacts are similar in terms of statistical significance and often as well magnitude for the poverty measures, but school enrollment gains tend to be statistically significant in areas with high rainfall (both types of districts in terms of rainfall levels exhibit some gains in nutrition measures from international remittances, with one of the three impacts being statistically significant, albeit not the same one in the two types of districts).

Conclusion
Is the impact of remittances on poverty and human development different in various areas depending on their climate? By combining nationally representative household survey data with climate data, we have tried to answer this question in the case of Yemen. Our main results can be summarized in four main points. First, remittances--which are substantial in Yemen--tend to have positive impacts on poverty measures, school enrollment, and measures of malnutrition. Second, the impact of international remittances tends to be larger than that of domestic remittances, probably because among beneficiaries, the amount of remittances received tends to be higher for international than for domestic remittances. Third, the impact of remittances--and especially international remittances--on measures of poverty and malnutrition tends to be larger in areas affected by high temperatures, and also to some extent in areas with lower levels of rainfall, which in both cases tend to be more vulnerable. Fourth, and by contrast, in areas with higher levels of rainfall or lower levels of temperatures, where issues of poverty and malnutrition may be less severe, remittances--and again especially international remittances--tend to have a larger impact on school enrollment. Thus, the results suggest, as might be expected, that in areas with unfavorable climate, remittances help first for meeting basic needs in order to escape poverty and malnutrition, while in areas with more favorable climate, remittances can be used by households for investments, such as investments in the education of children.
Climate change and migration are major concerns in the Middle East and North Africa region, yet the empirical evidence on the impact of climate change and extreme weather events on migration remains limited. Information is broadly lacking on how households in vulnerable areas perceive changes in the climate, how they are affected by extreme weather events, whether they benefit from community and government programs to help them cope with and adapt to a changing climate, and how these conditions influence the decision of household members to migrate, either temporarily or permanently.
Climate Change and Migration: Evidence from the Middle East and North Africa provides a dozen papers and an overall synthesis on various aspects of the relationship between the climate and migration. It is based in large part on the results of new household surveys and focus groups undertaken in Algeria, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, and the Republic of Yemen. The results suggest that households do perceive important changes in the climate, and that many households are being affected by extreme weather events resulting in losses in income, crops, and livestock. The coping and adaptation strategies used by households to deal with weather shocks are diverse, but also limited, with most households not able to recover from the negative impact of weather shocks. The ability of community-level responses and government programs to support households is also very limited. Finally, while climate change is currently not the main driver of migration flows, it does contribute to these flows, with worsening climatic conditions likely to exacerbate future migration flows.

WB-2016-12.txt,"World Bank Group Climate Change Action Plan 2016­20  Executive Summary Climate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group (WBG). Current weather extremes already affect millions of people, putting food and water security at risk, and threatening agricultural supply chains and many coastal cities. Without further action to reduce extreme poverty, provide access to basic services, and strengthen resilience, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. Climate change presents enormous challenges and opportunities for development, making it essential that climate and development be tackled in an integrated way. The world needs to feed nine billion people by 2050, provide affordable energy access to all, and extend housing and services to two billion new urban dwellers--and to do so while minimizing emissions and boosting resilience. Recent global developments favor bold climate action by the WBG. At the most recent Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, 140 World Bank client countries committed to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of an agreement to limit global warming to less than 2°C by 2100, and make best efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. At the same time, public and private actors have renewed their global commitments to increase investments and research and development, boost carbon pricing, and end wasteful energy subsidies. This Climate Change Action Plan (for short: ""the Action Plan"") demonstrates how the WBG intends to meet these challenges and opportunities, by scaling up climate action, integrating climate change across its operations, and working more closely with others. The Action Plan is driven by client demand, focused on activities that support the WBG's core mission, and builds on the WBG's comparative advantage. Countries start from different points and have different emission levels, and therefore need differentiated actions and support. These differences translate into different climate commitments in the NDCs, and into different needs in terms of support that the WBG can and will provide. To get impact at scale, the Action Plan is focused on helping to shape national investment plans and policies and leveraging the private sector. Financing needs for resilient, low-carbon growth are much larger than available public resources, and WBG resources are small relative to these needs. Policy and institutional support for national investment plans and for facilitating private sector initiatives will be critical to having impact at scale. The Action Plan reconfirms the WBG's commitment to increase the climate-related share of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand, with total financing (including leveraged co-financing) of potentially $29 billion per year by 2020. Meeting these targets is conditional on sustained aggregate WBG lending volumes, access to concessional finance, and client demand. The Action Plan is underpinned by five strategic shifts for the WBG's climate work: (i) Implementation: the WBG focus will accelerate support for countries and companies to implement the plans they have developed. (ii) Convergence: the WBG climate and development agendas will be fully integrated into strategies and operations, and global- and country-level action will be aligned. (iii) Maximizing impact: the WBG will increase its focus on impact at scale, including shaping national investment policies and programs and mobilizing private finance. (iv) Resilience: the WBG climate portfolio will be rebalanced-- putting a greater focus on adaptation and resilience. (v) Transformation: achieving global climate commitments will require a shift from business as usual. The Action Plan will focus on facilitating transformational impacts. The Action Plan is based on comprehensive joint preparation between the Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA), Regions, Global Practices (GPs) and other CCSAs, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The Regions and GPs, as well as the IFC, have prepared a background analysis and developed complementary and detailed contributions. The Action Plan also includes the IFC Climate Change Implementation Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan. WBG activities under the Climate Change Action Plan are organized along four top-level priorities: (i) support transformational policies and institutions, (ii) leverage resources, (iii) scale up climate action, and (iv) align internal processes and work with others.  Support Transformational Policies and Institutions The WBG will support countries in translating their NDCs into climate policies and investment plans into actions, and in mainstreaming climate considerations into policies and budgets, through advisory services, public expenditure reviews, and development policy operations. The objective is to help client countries strengthen their resilience and adaptive capacity, and deliver affordable and efficient services (especially energy) in a low-carbon manner and in a way that is consistent with their NDCs and global climate commitments. The WBG will work to ensure that the vulnerable are protected and will help build country capacity in this regard. The WBG will scale up country-level support and global advocacy work to ""get prices right"", by helping clients to reform fossil fuel subsidies, put a price on carbon, deepen market-based instruments, and reform other distorting subsidies. Carbon pricing work will be extended to widen, deepen, and connect markets.  Leverage Resources The IFC will crowd in private sector finance by significantly scaling up its own investments--from $2.3 billion to about $3.5 billion in five years. By 2020, it will mobilize at least $13 billion per year in external private sector investments through its operations.   To ""green"" the financial sector, the WBG will work with regulators, create green banking champions, provide climate credit lines, and promote continued growth and development of the green bond market. The WBG will scale up financial leverage in operations for resilience and mitigation through improving the preparation, structuring, and aggregation of projects; de-risking private investments; and scaling up support for a climate-smart focus in project preparation facilities. Cross-WBG ""deal teams"" will focus on delivering bankable/investable projects, including through the use of blended concessional finance, for high-impact sectors--such as energy infrastructure, rooftop solar, distributed energy service companies, and resilient urban infrastructure. The International Development Association (IDA) has a strong record of supporting climate change activities, and the WBG has a strong record of using blended non-IDA concessional finance, but existing funding is limited. There is an ongoing need for concessional finance, IDA and non-IDA, to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, build climate resilience, and meet climate targets. The WBG is counting on a strong IDA18 replenishment and significant non-IDA concessional financial support to meet the targets in this Action Plan. In the coming months, the WBG will develop an integrated approach to the mobilization and management of these different sources of funding in the context of the Forward Look initiative. The WBG will focus on enhancing the effectiveness of, and helping countries gain access to, concessional climate finance. Concessional climate finance will be concentrated on the incremental cost of climate action, to redirect investment flows and maximize impact. The WBG will work to ensure that policy options, institutional practices, and reforms are deployed to minimize the required level of concessional finance.  Scale Up Climate Action By 2020, the WBG will have significantly scaled up its activities with climate co-benefits in multiple sectors and increased its impact in countries through direct investments, advisory services, and the shaping of new and innovative solutions. In particular, the WBG will deepen and scale up its action in six high-impact areas, with indicative targets that represent current expectations of future demand. Achievement of these targets will be dependent as always on client demand; these targets are not commitments and will be adjusted over time. The six areas are described in the following. Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency The World Bank will use multiple instruments to de-risk renewable energy investments, with a cumulative target of adding 20 gigawatts (GW) in renewable energy generation over five years, that is, a doubling of current World Bank additions. The World Bank will ""green"" grids with the aim to enable the addition of 10 GW of variable renewable energy over the same period, and ensure that all energy investments are adapted to climate change. The IFC and    MIGA will support grid-connected clean energy by focusing on large hydropower, wind, and solar, continuing to open new markets with ""first-of "" investments, and helping industrial and commercial clients expand the use of low-carbon captive power. The WBG will increase its share of energy efficiency operations and aim to invest $1 billion to promote energy efficiency and resilient building in urban areas. The World Bank will aim to mobilize $25 billion in commercial funding for clean energy over the next five years. Sustainable Mobility The WBG will help countries develop sustainable mobility alternatives and implement transport adaptation options. It will increase the share of its transport portfolio that contributes to climate mitigation and resilience. It will pursue urban mobility and low-carbon, multimodal transport operations in all regions and aim for $2 billion in lending for adaptation in the transport sector over fiscal year (FY) 16­FY20 (four times the level in the previous five-year period), with a strong focus on enhancing the resilience of the road portfolio. The WBG will also focus on improving the competitiveness and fuel efficiency of the trucking sectors, promote green freight, and lead a global coalition to develop a framework for sustainable mobility. Sustainable and Resilient Cities The WBG will further integrate climate into urban planning, by developing tools and knowledge products through the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities, and aim to roll these out in at least 30 cities by 2020. It will develop and aims to pilot in 15 cities by 2020 a city-based resilience approach that integrates infrastructure development, land use planning, disaster risk management, institutions/governance, social components, and infrastructure investment. It will incorporate principles of integrated urban water management in its urban operations. By 2020, transit-oriented development solution packages will be piloted in at least five cities. The IFC and MIGA will increase investments in municipal transport. Climate-Smart Land Use, Water, and Food Security Climate-smart agriculture profiles and investment plans will be developed by 2020 for at least 40 countries, and climate-smart agriculture programs will be delivered at scale, with a focus on hybrid seeds and carbon capture practices, high-efficiency/low-energy-use irrigation programs, livestock productivity, energy solutions for agribusiness, and mainstreaming of risk management. Under the Forest Action Plan, the WBG aims to support Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Conservation of Forest Stocks, Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+) strategies in more than 50 countries, and develop/implement in 10 countries a large-scale, multisector program promoting ""forest-smart"" development and mobilizing International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)/IDA/REDD+ financing. The WBG will work with its   partners to improve the effectiveness of the various forest climate funds. The WBG will develop a series of area-based operations in climate-sensitive locations, using ecosystem-based adaptation, land restoration, integrated water management, and biodiversity conservation, to maximize the development benefits and the use of carbon sinks. It will implement large-scale national and transboundary programs to promote water efficiency across sectors, and improved water management. Analytical work will be further developed on the energy-water-food nexus. Green Competitiveness By 2020, the WBG aims to have assisted 20 countries in enhancing their capacity to innovate in climate sectors and increase industrial competitiveness in response to climate change, including through greening global value chains and trade practices, developing eco-industrial zones, and introducing best practices for standards and labeling. The IFC will intensify its work with entrepreneurs, through incubators and private equity investments, to increase impact and grow the market in climate-smart innovation. Leaving No One Behind By 2020, the WBG will aim to (i) help bring access to high-quality hydrometeorological data and early warning systems to another 100 million people in 15 developing countries; (ii) help bring adaptive social protection to an additional 50 million people; and (iii) provide five more countries coverage with integrated sovereign disaster risk financing instruments, including insurance, risk pools, and contingent finance. The Small Island States Resilience Initiative will build capacity, better use the existing fragmented funds, and mobilize increased financing for small island states. The WBG will produce a flagship report on climate change and migration/conflict. The WBG will also strengthen action on climate and health, increase its capacity to respond to the 32 IBRD and 40 IDA-eligible countries that have included health in their NDCs, and integrate climate considerations within its support for universal health care.  Align Internal Processes and Work with Others With selected partners, the WBG will create, share, pilot, and implement new and innovative solution packages that answer client countries' demands, especially those linked to their NDCs, and continue contributing to the global debate on climate and development. The WBG's internal capacity to respond will also increase. WBG country strategies will take into account climate goals and opportunities, and climate risks. The World Bank will screen all projects for climate risks and account for the social cost of carbon emissions in project evaluations; the WBG will move toward accounting for climate and carbon risks in its operations. In addition, the impact of WBG operations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will be calculated and reported.    The WBG will work with others to benefit from what they do best, and ensure synergies across actors active in the field. The WBG will continue to strengthen alignment and cooperation with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and bilaterals on strategies and work programs; work on mainstreaming principles and reporting with MDBs and the international development finance agencies; strengthen collaboration with leading think tanks, research groups, nongovernmental organizations, and business alliance groups, including on coordinated analytical work and country support; and build on work already started to increase collaboration with the International Monetary Fund on fossil fuel subsidies, carbon pricing, and the fiscal implications of climate change, especially for small island states. Global advocacy will be stepped up on selected issues where the WBG has an established voice--carbon pricing, mainstreaming climate action, and protecting the poor and vulnerable--with a focus on ""how"" to deliver rather than ""why."" The WBG will align internal processes, metrics, and incentives to support the implementation of the Action Plan. Systematic Country Diagnostics and Country Partnership Frameworks will consider the risks and opportunities created by climate change and countries' climate priorities. Risk screening will be extended to IBRD operations in early 2017, after a review of existing tools and the lessons drawn from application to IDA countries, and will integrate gender considerations into the screening tools. The IFC will start screening some sectors after having tested and validated its climate impact risk screening tool; this is expected to be done by September 2016 and to lay the basis for the IFC's path forward. The WBG will continue to roll out GHG accounting and account for carbon emissions, and resulting risk, in its project evaluations. The World Bank will account for the social cost of carbon emissions in its project evaluations, and the IFC will evaluate such an approach later this year. Over the next 18 months, the WBG will continue to develop and mainstream metrics and indicators to measure the outcomes of WBG operations, and move monitoring and evaluation from inputs to outcomes, to incentivize a greater focus on leverage. Easily accessible, consolidated ""one-stop-shop"" data will be made available to all staff on climate impacts, NDCs, climate finance, analytic tools, and methodologies. Learning modules on climate will be expanded and mainstreamed into the World Bank's core curriculum, and support to the community of practice of climate change practitioners across the World Bank will be strengthened. The WBG organization is now aligned to deliver on this Action Plan. All WBG units have put in place structures to mainstream climate change into their activities and operations. The IFC has developed a Climate Business Network that includes one climate anchor from each industry department and from each region, advisory, and operational unit. The Climate Change CCSA works with all WBG units to provide targeted, cross-cutting climate support.    1. Context and Rationale  Climate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group (WBG): to end extreme poverty and increase shared prosperity in a sustainable way. Current weather extremes already affect millions of people, putting food and water security at risk, and threatening agricultural supply chains and many coastal cities. As shown in the WBG's Turn Down the Heat reports,1 climate change will make these events more frequent and extreme. WBG borrowers are exposed to greater climate risks than high-income countries are. Climate impacts on food security are especially strong, for example, in Africa. Lower-income countries suffer disproportionally from natural disasters, with almost half of disaster casualties occurring in low-income countries, and economic losses sometimes exceeding 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in small, vulnerable economies. Specific locations, such as small islands or large cities located in deltas and low-lying coastal zones (especially in Africa and Asia), are at very high risk. As the WBG's Shock Waves report2 demonstrates, without further action to reduce extreme poverty, provide access to basic services, strengthen resilience, and increase adaptive capacity, climate impacts could push an additional 100 million people into poverty by 2030. Sustaining long-term poverty reduction means that it is essential to meet global climate objectives to keep average temperature increases below 2°C, which in turn requires rapid global action to reach zero net emissions by the second half of the century. There are limits to what adaptation and resilience actions can achieve, and avoiding the long-term threat to prosperity requires stabilization of the climate. Maintaining the increase in global temperature below 2°C would prevent many of the worst impacts of climate change from occurring. Doing so requires urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks. Delaying action would significantly increase the cost of keeping warming below 2°C--according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, delaying action until 2030 would increase total mitigation costs by 50 percent.3 Climate change presents enormous challenges, and opportunities, for development, making it essential that climate and development be tackled in an integrated way. The world needs to feed nine billion people by 2050 while reducing emissions, increasing carbon sinks, and ensuring climate-resilient food security. It needs to provide affordable energy access to the 1.1 billion people worldwide who still live without electricity, while keeping emissions to a minimum and managing a transition away from fossil fuels. New research suggests that more than four billion people already experience severe water scarcity during some part of the year, and climate change will increase water stress in many regions. Countries will have to provide access to mobility using resilient and low-carbon transport modes and systems. Cities will have to welcome two billion new urban dwellers with livable, energy-efficient dwellings, low-carbon transport, good jobs, and appropriate access to services, while reducing vulnerability to climate shocks. Populations need to be    protected against natural disasters and climate-related diseases, even as hazards are expected to increase in frequency and intensity over time. And $90 trillion in low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure investment will be needed by 2030--mostly in developing countries. Building more resilient infrastructure is essential to adapting to climate change, but is also likely to increase upfront costs, although it will be cost-effective in the longer run. There are also opportunities to exploit the co-benefits from climate-smart development. Climate-smart urban planning and public transit can improve the livability of cities; renewable energy and mini grids can provide new opportunities to improve energy access; energy efficiency can reduce energy costs and improve fuel security; and climate-smart agriculture and efficient food supply chains lead to higher agricultural productivity, less waste, and better food security. Recent global developments favor bold climate action from the WBG. At COP21 in Paris, the world came together and agreed to limit global warming to less than 2°C by 2100, and make best efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. As part of the Paris process, 140 World Bank client countries committed to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline their actions on climate action. In 2015, the world also committed to the Sustainable Development Goals, the Financing for Development Agreements, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In parallel, many firms made strong commitments before or during COP21: 114 companies announced emission reduction targets; 36 multinationals committed to use 100 percent renewable energy; and more than 1,000 companies are setting up carbon pricing systems. The negotiators have done their job. The priority in the next few years is to focus on accelerated implementation. COP22 in Morocco will be an opportunity to take stock of the implementation of the first year of these commitments. All these commitments show increasing global demand for climate change action and a mandate and opportunity for the WBG to support countries and companies in meeting these objectives, in partnership with others. At the same time, good policies and technological advances are making more rapid advances possible. Renewable energy prices continue to fall, there is a renewed global commitment to research and development, and the use of big data is enabling cheaper and faster risk assessments. And there is growing momentum behind carbon pricing and ending wasteful energy subsidies. There are large opportunities for WBG interventions.   2. Climate Change Action Plan: Structure and Drivers  This Climate Change Action Plan demonstrates how the WBG intends to meet these challenges and opportunities. It lays out concrete actions to help countries and companies address current and future climate risks and opportunities, and describes how the WBG will build on its comparative advantage, scale up climate action, integrate climate change across its operations, and better work with others. WBG climate action will be driven by client demand, focusing on those activities that support the WBG's core mission and build on its comparative advantage. The actions proposed focus on supporting client demand, recognizing that client needs differ. The Action Plan focuses on supporting the WBG's core mission of eliminating extreme poverty and enhancing shared prosperity in a sustainable way. And it builds on the WBG's comparative advantage to tackle complex, multisector problems in an integrated way, combining all of its instruments (funding, knowledge, and convening power), its local presence but global reach and experience, its deep technical expertise and multisector integration, and its ability to work across the public and private sectors. To get impact at scale, a key focus of the Action Plan is to help to shape policies and national investment plans and leverage the private sector. Financing needs for resilient, low-carbon growth are much larger than available public resources, and WBG resources are small relative to these needs. The investment needs embedded in the NDCs amount to more than $1 trillion per year over the next 15 years, while WBG annual commitments are around $60 billion per annum. Although WBG funding will remain important, policy and institutional support for national investment plans and strategic use of private sector finance to open markets and facilitate increased actions from external investors will be critical to having impact at scale. To achieve its global climate commitments, the WBG will support transformational changes in multiple domains. While action on the ground will be driven by demand in countries, the Action Plan will accelerate action by driving innovative solutions shaped by WBG global experience in several high- priority areas. To enable this change, WBG activities under the Climate Change Action Plan are organized along four top-level priorities and four objectives for 2020 (see table 2.1). The Action Plan is underpinned by five strategic shifts for the WBG's climate work: ·· Implementation. With Paris behind us, the WBG will shift its focus toward supporting countries, companies, and teams to accelerate implementation, giving more attention to ""how"" to get results on the ground than on advocacy as to ""why"" change is needed. ·· Convergence. The WBG climate and development agendas (including subcomponents like gender, health, and others) will be fully integrated    Table 2.1 The Four Priorities of the WBG Climate Change Action Plan, and associated objectives for 2020  WBG Climate Change Action Plan Priority I: Support Transformational Policies and Institutions. Deep economic transformations need to be enabled by a supportive policy and investment environment and stronger institutional capacity that redirects investment flows, including public and private as well as international and domestic capital. Priority II: Leverage Resources. Meeting global climate goals will require the crowding in of much higher levels of private sector finance and investment. Priority III: Scale Up Climate Action. To accelerate transformation and develop new solutions, the WBG will increase its investments with climate co-benefits, focusing on a few high-impact areas and rebalancing its portfolio with more focus on adaptation and resilience. Priority IV: Align Internal Processes and Work with Others. The climate challenge can only be met through collective action and partnerships. The Action Plan will strengthen the WBG's partnerships, engage in focused global advocacy, develop and share knowledge and solutions, and align internal processes to support staff in implementation.  By 2020, the WBG will have contributed to sustainable poverty alleviation and shared prosperity by building resilience to climate change impacts and policies and decarbonizing development. Objective. By 2020, the WBG will have supported new enabling policies and institutional change in client countries, integrating the development and climate agendas, with a focus on the poorest and most vulnerable. Objective. By 2020, the WBG will have facilitated larger private capital flows toward resilient and low-carbon projects in its client countries, making the best possible use of concessional climate resources. It will have mobilized at least $13 billion per year in external private sector investments through its operations. Objective. By 2020, the WBG will have significantly scaled up its activities with climate co-benefits in multiple sectors and increased its impact in countries through direct investments and the shaping of new and innovative solutions. At least 28 percent of WBG operations will generate climate co-benefits, and at least 75 percent of the scaled-up initiatives proposed in this Action Plan will have had a measurable impact. Objective. With selected partners, the WBG will have created, shared, piloted, and implemented new and innovative solution packages that answer client countries' demands, especially those linked to their nationally determined contributions, and contributed to the global debate on climate and development. WBG country strategies will take into account climate goals and opportunities, and climate risks. The World Bank will screen all projects for climate risks and account for the social cost of carbon emissions in project evaluations; the International Finance Corporation will move toward accounting for climate and carbon risks in its operations.  into strategies and operations, and global objectives, such as climate stabilization, will be distilled into and coordinated with country strategies and operations. ·· Maximum impact. The WBG will move from measuring inputs to measuring impacts, with better metrics and evaluation. In particular, it will increase its focus on the total resources mobilized and catalyzed, rather than only focus on its own account lending, and adjust internal processes and incentives accordingly. ·· Resilience. The WBG climate portfolio will be rebalanced with a greater focus on adaptation and resilience, taking into account the contribution of resilience to poverty alleviation and the contribution of development and poverty reduction to resilience. ·· Transformation. Achieving global climate commitments and protecting the world against the negative impacts of climate change will require a shift from business as usual in multiple domains. The Action Plan will focus on facilitating these transformational impacts.    The Action Plan is based on comprehensive joint preparation by the Climate Change Cross-Cutting Solutions Area (CCSA), Regions, Global Practices (GPs) and other CCSAs, International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Such preparation ensures ownership: each Region and GP, as well as the IFC, has prepared background analyses (see the appendix). The preparation also includes the IFC Climate Change Implementation Plan and the Africa Climate Business Plan. The Action Plan has been designed through an iterative process. Agreed actions are a combination of bottom-up proposals from different units and a top-down push for strategic coherence and ambition. The process of development of the Action Plan deepened unit-level understanding of options and led to increased ambition. And the Action Plan promoted IFC-MIGA-World Bank and cross-sector cooperation in the design of high-impact actions (for example, leverage of private capital) and in the definition of regional priorities.  A Demand-Driven Plan Countries start from different points and have different emission levels, are exposed to different impacts, and therefore need customized actions and support (figure 2.1 and 2.2). Low-income countries currently have very low levels of emissions per capita; they are not expected to implement the same actions as richer countries, although they would benefit from avoiding carbon- intensive lock-ins and a future of high emissions. These differences translate into different climate commitments in the NDCs, and different needs in terms of support that the WBG can and will provide. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has immense needs for adaptation, food security, resilience, and energy access. Most NDCs in Africa prioritize adaptation. Current WBG climate funding up to FY16 focuses on mitigation, but the WBG's Africa Climate Business Plan aims to raise $16 billion for adaptation investments by 2020, including strengthening the resilience of natural, physical, and human capital, powering resilience, which will focus on improving energy access via renewable energy, and enabling resilience with support for hydrometeorological services and improved tools and capacity for climate-resilient investment planning. The IFC will invest in large-scale renewable energy, green buildings, and off-grid electricity, and will also be looking at developing agricultural adaptation opportunities, which will require new business models and technical assistance. The East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region contributes a third of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The region also includes some of the areas that are most vulnerable to climate impacts (for example, small islands). Generation capacity is expected to double by 2030 and, despite a decline in the share of coal, generation from coal is projected to increase by 455 gigawatts (GW) under a business as usual scenario. Forests and landscapes are a key element of the climate challenge in the region and a major focus of climate policies. Current WBG operations are well aligned with the NDCs. A significant level of deliveries is expected  in FY16, with an expected share of investment with climate co-benefits near 50 percent. The IFC will expand its climate business in urban infrastructure and renewable energy, with an emerging focus on South-South business. The IFC will also build its climate-smart agriculture business in key markets. Europe and Central Asia (ECA) has countries with high energy intensity, large forest resources, and differentiated vulnerability depending on subregions. The NDCs focus on mitigation, but several also mention adaptation. Current climate action in ECA aims to address energy intensity, green growth, sustainable forestry, sustainable cities, climate resilience, and support for clients' NDCs. There are opportunities to scale up climate funding, especially by tackling high energy intensity, implementing integrated multisector planning, and fostering cross-country knowledge exchange to support long-term action on climate change at the national level. There are private sector opportunities in renewable energy, sustainable cities, and sustainable energy finance. Latin America and the Caribbean (LCR) is vulnerable to natural disasters and a shifting energy matrix that risks raising emissions through increased reliance on fossil fuels, but is an innovator on climate policies (for example, green growth strategies and carbon tax on fossil fuels in Mexico, and sustainable forest management in Brazil). The region has developed ambitious NDCs with many unconditional pledges, although some action is conditioned on the availability of climate finance. The current WBG climate portfolio already targets climate, mostly mitigation and disaster risk management (DRM), with increasing private sector opportunities in urban infrastructure and agribusiness. The Middle East and North Africa (MNA) region represents 7 percent of global emissions, but has high per capita emissions in oil-producing countries, and half of the world's energy subsidies. Extreme vulnerability to climate change is linked to water availability and agriculture, sea level rise, and heat waves. The NDCs are often less ambitious than the reforms already underway in the energy sector, which can offer large mitigation co-benefits. The WBG is ramping up its climate co-benefits in MNA from 13 to 29 percent, primarily via mitigation in energy, finance and markets, and transport (93 percent) in FY16­FY17. There is large potential to grow WBG climate co-benefits in MNA in agriculture, cities, and water. The South Asia region (SAR) is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise, floods, landslides, and agriculture--and rural areas have low access to clean and modern energy services. Between FY11 and FY15, 29 percent of the regional portfolio included climate co-benefits. Transformative action on climate change requires partnership with countries to mobilize additional capital for mitigation and adaptation action. The NDCs suggest large demand for funding for adaptation and mitigation, with private sector opportunities in urban infrastructure, and wind and solar, and potential for sustainable agriculture. Some regions are preparing bottom-up regional climate business plans, based on known demands and needs. The Africa Climate Business Plan was launched at COP21 in December 2015; other regions are undertaking a similar process, with identification of current demands and needs at the country level. A summary of priorities and key actions per region is included in the appendix. In parallel, the GPs, IFC, and MIGA are working on new solutions to offer our   client countries and private sector actors, with an FY20 time horizon and based on global knowledge and lessons learned. These solutions will be tailored to country contexts and offered through country-level engagement.  Building on WBG Comparative Advantage The WBG is uniquely positioned to bring the global climate agenda into the country-level development agenda, and align climate objectives with development. The WBG will focus on combining its knowledge, finance, and convening power in areas of comparative advantage, as identified by the Forward Look Initiative and summarized in figure 2.3. ·· Country AND global. As a leading provider of globally informed knowledge and solutions, and with a strong country presence, the WBG can develop, pilot, share, and support the implementation of innovative, climate-smart development options and policies, integrating country- level solutions and global experience and advocacy. ·· Public AND private. As a Group, the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are uniquely positioned to help develop and implement the public-private collaborations that are required to accelerate innovation and leverage private capital and resources for climate change. ·· Single AND multisector. As an organization that has engagements with all ministries and sectors, the WBG develops and implements the complex cross-sector and integrated solutions that the climate change challenge calls for.  Building on WBG Experience The main agencies of the WBG have deployed increasing balance sheet resources and dedicated climate funding to catalyze many projects with significant climate co-benefits.1 Over the past five fiscal years, the WBG has committed an average of $10.3 billion a year of its own resources, or around 21 percent2 of commitments, to help developing countries and emerging economies mitigate the effects and adapt to the challenges of climate change. More specifically, in that period, more than $50 billion has been committed by the WBG through more than 900 projects with climate-related activities,  with 27 percent focusing on helping people and countries adapt to a changing climate and 73 percent on mitigating the impact of climate change. The IFC's core climate business nearly doubled between FY11 and FY15, and 27 percent of MIGA guarantees have climate co-benefits. Climate co-benefits are generated in multiple sectors. Mitigation activities have included investments in renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, and hydropower), the promotion of energy efficiency, and changes to urban transportation and railways. Adaptation activities have included projects supporting coastal and flood protection, irrigation and drainage systems, protection for forests and landscapes, and the development of resilient crop systems. Beyond investment funding, the WBG provides policy and technical advice, including on project design. Although technical support to client countries on climate change may be small in financial terms, it can deliver major impacts for low-emission and climate-resilient development. Figure 2.4 provides the breakdown of climate co-benefits per GP and entity. Mitigation action has dominated the current portfolio of projects with climate co-benefits.  Meeting WBG Commitments The Action Plan reconfirms the WBG's commitment made at the 2015 Annual Meetings in Lima, Peru, to increase the climate-related share of its portfolio from 21 to 28 percent by 2020 in response to client demand, with total    financing (including leveraged co-financing) of potentially $29 billion per year by 2020. Meeting these targets is conditional on sustained aggregate WBG lending volumes, access to concessional finance, and client demand. Based on estimates from the GPs, IFC, and MIGA, climate co-benefits could represent 28 percent of total lending by FY20 in a high scenario, and 25 percent in a low scenario. The GPs, Regions, IFC, and MIGA have identified and assessed areas of business growth, based on known and expected demand, under high and low scenarios (figure 2.5). The Action Plan works toward increasing the probability that the high scenario will materialize by (i) supporting demand growth with analytical work and country engagement; (ii) developing innovative solutions based on global experience that will create their own demand (for example, new approaches for resilience, and business models for scaling up renewable energy); (iii) better leveraging concessional climate finance to increase demand and generate more climate co-benefits with WBG resources; and (iv) building new climate business models and markets in key strategic areas where commercial capital needs assistance.   Meeting these targets is conditional on sustained aggregate WBG lending volumes, sustained access to concessional finance, and sustained client demand. The WBG's commitment in Lima noted that this is ""in response to demand"" and ""with support of its members."" The analysis presented in this Action Plan assumes (i) constant lending volume for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) (at FY15 levels); (ii) constant volume for the International Development Association 18 (IDA18) (compared with IDA17); (iii) growth in the IFC's own account consistent with the IFC's strategy and business outlook FY17­FY19 (and then a continued 4 percent per year growth to FY20); and (iv) a 10 percent annual growth rate in MIGA's issuance of new guarantees (consistent with MIGA's Strategic Directions FY15­FY17 paper, extrapolated to FY20). Should aggregate lending be lower, then the level of climate co-benefits will be lower than targeted, because of the lower overall lending and the probability that the share of climate co-benefits will be closer to the lower end of the projected range, in the face of competition for scarce resources. Sustained access to concessional climate finance, blended with WBG resources and private finance, will also be critical to meeting these objectives. In addition, this will require that the implicit client demand for climate solutions be translated into firm demand, in the face of competing demands for non- climate poverty reducing activities. The largest risk in this regard would arise if economic conditions were to remain weak or worsen in several large borrowers, and this resulted in a relative increase in demand for policy reforms, budget support operations, and a higher proportion of social protection lending. Many actions proposed in the Action Plan will contribute to increasing the share of climate co-benefits in WBG operations. These actions are presented in the following sections, with indicative targets that represent current expectations regarding future demand. These targets are not commitments and they will be adjusted over time. Increasing climate co-benefits does not necessarily crowd out other sector investments. The focus on climate co-benefits tracks the amount of WBG lending that is tagged for climate benefits. Operations so tagged also deliver development benefits in mobility, energy access and security, clean air, agricultural production, etc. Thus, they do not crowd out other investments. However, an increase in climate co-benefits does mean that the relative share of operations with climate benefits will increase, and the share of operations that do not have climate benefits will as a result decline.  3. Priority I: Support Transformational Policies and Institutions To increase resilience and achieve climate commitments, deep economic transformations will be necessary, enabled by the policy and investment environment and institutions. The WBG will support countries in strengthening their sector-specific and national development planning processes, policies, and expenditure and fiscal frameworks, and in building institutional capacity to enable these transformations (see Box 3.1 for examples). These actions will aim to improve policies and public and private investments. To enhance   impact, the WBG will work to build coalitions of partners to support this work in a coordinated way.  Support Countries to Transform Climate Commitments and Priorities into Actions The WBG will support countries to translate their NDCs into climate actions, and to mainstream climate considerations into policies and budgets. The NDCs are a new and welcome instrument. However, their quality and specificity vary considerably across countries. Building on the analysis already completed of all the NDCs, and requests from several countries for specific support, the WBG will expand its support, on demand, to more countries to translate their NDCs into specific targets, prioritized policy interventions, targeted investment plans, and financing plans. To provide further support for implementation, the WBG will, building on experience in a few countries to date (see Box 3.1 for examples), support client countries in integrating their NDC plans and broader climate considerations into their national planning and budgeting processes. Over time, the WBG will also support, on demand, the design of future NDCs to enable a progressive increase in ambition. The exact extent of demand for support on mainstreaming NDCs is uncertain. This will be a priority for the WBG, but the speed will be determined over the coming years. Several partner organizations are looking to support countries in this area. The WBG will work to form coalitions to avoid duplication and focus on its comparative advantage. In this regard, the WBG has strong connections with ministries of finance and planning, strong public finance skills, and the ability to bring a multisector and strong analytical perspective and global experience. However, there is a strong role for other partners as well, and the WBG will work closely with others in this area. The WBG will intensify its efforts to support low-carbon development, including with support to reforms of the energy sector (for example, through development policy financing or the Program for Results), to help client countries deliver affordable and efficient services (energy, mobility, etc.) in a low-carbon manner and in a way that is consistent with their NDCs and global climate commitments. This work will rely on country engagement and analytical work to identify lower-carbon options and pathways, and subsequent policy and investment needs, with a focus on countries where a large increase in energy consumption is expected in the next decades. The WBG will support resilient development through advisory services, public expenditure reviews, and development policy operations, with a strong focus on ensuring that the vulnerable are protected. The WBG will expand the use of development policy operations to support policy and institutional reforms to strengthen resilience. Based on the Shock Waves report1, poverty impact analysis at the country level will be used to inform climate action, consider distributional impacts, and design ongoing analytical work. Gender considerations will be built into climate risk and policy analysis and support.    To complement the policy and advisory support, the WBG will, in collaboration with others, support building institutions and capacity for climate-resilient investment planning and help countries build resilient and low-carbon alternatives into sector and project decisions. Get Prices Right A deep reduction in carbon emissions requires changes in public and private investments, and price signals are an efficient and powerful instrument to redirect investments toward lower-emissions projects and technologies. To accelerate progress and facilitate climate action, the WBG will scale up country-level support and global advocacy to ""get prices right"" by reducing damaging fossil fuel subsidies, putting a price on carbon, and deepening market-based instruments, and reforming other distorting subsidies. WBG workstreams within this space will be strengthened, including through stronger coordination of instruments and approaches. The resulting changes in the relative prices of renewable versus fossil fuel energy sources, when accompanied by other policy choices and concessional finance, could have a major impact on future energy mixes, ensuring that future capacity growth has a lower carbon content. In the past five years, the WBG has assisted many governments in assessing and reforming their energy sectors and subsidies (box 3.2), and will continue to do so. Direct fossil fuel subsidies were estimated at $493 billion in 2014, exceeding 1 percent of GDP in 31 countries. When properly implemented,  subsidy reforms can generate large benefits in terms of economic performance and poverty reduction, fiscal savings, and climate co-benefits. The WBG will continue to support fossil fuel subsidy reform on demand in priority countries (work is currently underway in 20 countries), integrating fiscal, social, political, and climate considerations. The current low fuel prices provide an opportunity to reduce these subsidies, but sustainable mechanisms will need to be put in place to keep these prices from rising again when fuel prices increase. Carbon pricing work will be extended to widen, deepen, and connect markets, with a focus on implementation at the country level. Carbon pricing is increasingly being used to incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see box 3.3). And an increasing number of private actors are supporting the introduction and use of carbon pricing. However, further efforts are needed to accelerate the increasing coverage of emissions (currently only 15 percent of GHG covered) and ensure the success and efficacy of pricing schemes, including but not limited to their effective price (85 percent of trades cost less than $10/ton). The WBG will work with partners in the coming months to agree on targets for a significant increase, by 2020, in the global share of GHG emissions covered by carbon prices, and a material increase in the effective carbon price in many of those markets. Much of this work will be supported through the convening, knowledge sharing, and analytical work of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), where the goal would be to increase the number of CPLC partner countries to cover more than 75 percent of global GHG emissions by 2018 (up from the current 30 percent), and to have actively supported country-level dialogues in 15 countries by end2017 and in 30 countries by 2020. Support will be continued for country programs through the Partnership for Market Readiness and extending the work on Networked Carbon Markets. The WBG will continue its influential annual flagship ""State and Trends of Carbon Pricing"" report. The Heads of State Panel on Carbon Pricing will be supported to expand its work at the global political level. Results-based financing mechanisms, which put   funding behind innovative market-based instruments such as the Pilot Auction Facility and the Transformative Carbon Asset Facility, will be expanded, and options to scale up these mechanisms will be evaluated. Work will continue on non-energy subsidies, such as water- and agriculture-related subsidies, and land tenure issues, which will be necessary to align incentives for development, environmental, and climate action. Note  4. Priority II: Leverage Resources Delivering on climate ambitions will require significant increases in investments in resilient and low-carbon infrastructure, in the context of a preexisting financing gap. Renewable energy--even when it is cost-effective--requires higher upfront investment; efficient and highly productive cities rely on public transit and resilient water and sanitation infrastructure that are highly capital-intensive; flood management infrastructure implies large investments; and energy-efficient and disaster-resistant buildings are more expensive to build, although the operating savings make up for more than the investment costs. As a result, meeting the development and climate challenges will require a significant increase in investment, and thus in financing, going beyond what public resources can provide. Increasing private capital flows toward developing countries--and toward infrastructure in these countries--is an imperative, making it critical to leveraging public resources. The WBG already achieves significant leverage of its resources. First, it leverages domestic public resources. Second, it mobilizes private capital through the IFC. And third, the WBG catalyzes public and private, domestic and international resources through, for instance, programmatic interventions to remove barriers, the opening of new markets with ""first-of "" investments, and piloting of new instruments or technologies. The IFC systematically mobilizes private sector capital through syndicated loans, asset management companies, public-private partnerships, and IFC initiatives (""core mobilization""). The IFC's climate scorecard includes core mobilized capital, creating an internal incentive to bring in external investors. The IFC brings in additional co-financing by typically financing no more than 25 to 35 percent of the total project cost. Since 2009, the IFC has mobilized $4.7 billion in core mobilization from private sector sources, and catalyzed an additional $30 billion in co-finance, for total climate-related private cofinancing of $34.7 billion. These figures represent a 1:3 leverage ratio to the IFC's own account. (Including public sector co-finance, this ratio is 1:4.) Opportunities for further leverage of private capital will grow, if the right conditions can be met. In 2014, a coalition accounting for more than $24 trillion in assets committed to invest in the low-carbon economy; and a year later, a group of 15 investors with $2.5 trillion in assets under management committed to scale up financing for energy efficiency. However, there are also risks and challenges related to private capital mobilization, including the weak operating environment in some countries, low energy prices in others, and the recent slowdown in economic growth.  Catalyze Private Capital The IFC's Climate Implementation Plan includes a significant scale-up of IFC own account investments with climate co-benefits, which will also increase    the volume of mobilized and catalyzed private capital. The IFC plans to grow its commitment with climate co-benefits to 28 percent, that is, to $3.5 billion by 2020, from the current level of $2.3 billion--a 50 percent increase in five years. The IFC's biggest impact is not its own account financing, but its ability to bring in external capital for co-investment in climate sectors. The WBG pledged to mobilize $13 billion in external private sector capital annually by FY20. To achieve this private sector co-financing, the IFC will need to increase its private sector leverage ratio from 1:3 to almost 1:4. To do so, the IFC will create products that attract larger institutional sources of capital through aggregation and securitization, create de-risking vehicles that use blended finance, and increase its climate-related public-private partnerships. The WBG will help to ""green"" the financial sector through a coordinated and integrated approach across banking, pensions, and capital markets to implement the changes needed globally and nationally. Resilient and effective financial sectors will need to address the risk of climate change for the financial sector, as well as the impact of the financial system on the climate through allocation of resources that could be misdirected, for example, because of fossil fuel subsidies and the absence of carbon pricing. The WBG will expand financing for green investments by working with regulators on the enabling environment; demonstrating the business case and creating green financial champions; using programmatic interventions to remove barriers to financial sector growth and use; promoting the adoption of appropriate environment and social performance standards by pension funds and banks; providing climate credit lines directly to private sector banks; and working with banks and investors/pension funds to identify and build the pipeline in climate sectors, as well as to measure and track their climate investments. This work includes providing technical advice to banks and pension funds, and integrating green elements into the development of bond markets. The WBG will provide climate finance policy guidance for regulators, including through the IFC-managed platform of the Sustainable Banking Network. The WBG will gather data on whether climate risk threatens the stability of the financial sector (globally but first in poor countries sensitive to climate risk), and develop a performance framework to assess the level of greening of the whole financial system and its contribution to climate change in terms of efficacy, efficiency, resilience, and transparency. By 2020, the WBG aims to have five country programs that can integrate green elements into banking, capital markets, and pension funds. The WBG will promote continued growth and development of the green bond market, at the corporate, financial institution, and municipal levels. The WBG has already played a significant role in developing a robust, liquid green bond market, reaching $41.8 billion in 2015. The IBRD has issued more than $8 billion in green bonds and the IFC has issued about $4.3 billion. This work will continue. To go further, the WBG will develop and deploy asset-backed, project, and other new classes of green bond issuances, and continue existing work in two or three countries, to implement green elements in ongoing bond market development programs.    Well-designed strategic investment funds (SIFs), with the government as anchor investor, could act as powerful catalysts to crowd in domestic and international institutional investors in large, climate-resilient infrastructure projects, by sharing and mitigating the risk of private investors. By 2020, the WBG plans to work with SIFs in 34 markets, to make them greener and support them in crowding in equity and debt financing from domestic and international institutional investors. The WBG will also scale up financial leverage in World Bank, IFC, and MIGA operations for resilience and mitigation by (i) improving the preparation, structuring, and aggregation of projects, and (ii) helping rebalance risk-reward profiles or de-risking private investments, for example, through blended finance instruments (such as senior/mezzanine loans, equity, quasi- equity, and guarantee products), asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, or renewables performance insurance. As one example, the objective is to mobilize $25 billion in commercial funds for clean energy between FY16 and FY20, including funds to support up to 20 GW of renewable energy generation. The WBG will scale up support for project preparation facilities, such as the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF) and the Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility, so that they support the creation of resilient or low- carbon projects, and ensure that projects are developed following best practices in terms of resilience and climate change adaptation. For instance, the GIF will encourage its technical partners to include shadow carbon pricing analysis for all projects, where relevant. It will also monitor and report on the portfolio share that delivers climate co-benefits. The GIF's effectiveness and efficiency in supporting climate-smart projects, among others, will be evaluated as part of the facility assessments. And the GIF will pursue operational collaboration with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and follow the same principles and approach in its design of the Downstream Finance Window. The World Bank, African Union Commission, and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa have teamed up to develop the Africa Climate Resilient Investment Facility to support the integration of climate change into infrastructure planning and design by developing guidelines, providing training, delivering on-demand advisory services, making data and knowledge tools more easily accessible, and ultimately helping attract funding from sources of development and climate finance. The WBG will also leverage expertise in a coordinated way across the WBG to tackle high-opportunity sectors. It will create ""deal teams"" to work with countries to deliver transactions at scale by generating a robust pipeline of bankable/investable projects from early stage to financial closure. For selected high-impact opportunities, blended concessional finance may be needed to demonstrate viability and attract private capital. Early-stage ideas include the following: ·· Energy infrastructure. The idea is to improve infrastructure deal flow and financing by operationalizing the work of the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) Finance Committee. By 2020, the WBG aims at working in six    countries, including four IDA countries, to help bundle projects and attract private investors. In FY17, an Infrastructure Management System Delivery Manual will be available to support all teams. ·· Rooftop solar. The photovoltaic (PV) solar industry has experienced tremendous growth in recent years, driven largely by declining costs and a growing interest in emission-free power. Rooftop installations for commercial, industrial, and residential customers make up a significant volume of total solar capacity, but growth is often held back because financing is unavailable. Creating the conditions for the flow of institutional capital into these smaller systems would have a major impact on scaling the deployment of rooftop solar. The goal is to close two systematic transactions on rooftop solar in two countries by 2020. ·· Distributed energy service companies (DESCOs). DESCOs provide assets at below cost to customers who pre-pay for energy services. DESCOs have benefited from innovative approaches to establish and monetize client relationships, increased mobile phone penetration, and the falling cost of PV. However, the model requires large sums of working capital and many DESCOs are struggling to finance rapid annual growth. A joint IFC/World Bank team will explore how the WBG can accelerate the growth of distributed solar in SSA. By 2020, the objective is to close two transactions in two countries and crowd in private capital through successful securitization. By 2020, the team expects the number of deployed solar home systems in Nigeria to have increased by 50,000 and the n umber in SSA by 150,000. ·· Resilient urban infrastructure. The ability of cities to finance urban infrastructure depends on their: (i) budgets and creditworthiness, (ii) ability to exploit existing assets to finance new ones, (iii) ability to access regional or national government funding streams, and (iv) access to capital markets and private finance. The existing financing gap highlights the challenge to connect the necessary private capital to governments. A WBG ""transaction team"" would act as brokers, engaging a global network of partners to leverage public/private funding solutions. By 2018, the objective is to close three transactions in more than one country, and by 2020, to close six transactions in two or more countries.  Optimize the Use of Concessional Finance IDA has had a strong record of supporting climate change activities. Sustained investment in good development outcomes is an important part of building the resilience of poor communities to climate change. Under IDA17, the WBG is contributing to mainstreaming climate and disaster risk in IDA countries' strategies, policies, plans, and investments, and screening all IDA projects for climate change and disaster risks (and where risks are identified, incorporating resilience into project design). It is expected that climate change will continue as an important theme in IDA18, the focus of which is under discussion with the IDA deputies.    The WBG has a strong record of using non-IDA concessional finance to support other resources used for mitigating the impact of climate change (see box 4.1), but existing funding is limited. The Climate Investment Funds (CIFs) supported $9.8 billion of IBRD, IDA, and IFC resources with their own $4.1 billion from 2010 to 2015. Across the multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the WBG, $8.3 billion from the CIFs is on track to  Box 4.1 Transformational Impact of Well-Used Concessional Climate Finance Concentrated Solar Power in Morocco The Moroccan Agency for Solar Energy, the government agency established to realize the country's solar ambitions, used a $43 million World Bank­Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant to test the viability of solar thermal technology at Ain Beni Mathar, in the northeast of the country, and encourage its replication nationwide. This laid the groundwork to scale up and secure the more than $3 billion needed for the Noor-Ouarzazate complex from the World Bank, the Climate Investment Funds' (CIFs') Clean Technology Fund, the African Development Bank, and European financing institutions. The approach accelerated cost reduction and the commercial adoption of large-scale, low greenhouse gas­emitting generation technologies while testing the viability of solar thermal technology to encourage its replication in Morocco and elsewhere. The China-GEF-World Bank Urban Transport Partnership Program (CUTPP) The program supports development of a national approach to sustainable urban transport, with activities in 14 cities. Approved in 2008, the CUTPP's $21 million GEF grant has leveraged more than $500 million of investment, including approximately $200 million in World Bank funds. The project has stimulated collaboration among national ministries, including the National Development and Reform Commission, which plays a key role in urban transport. Increasing Tajikistan's Resilience Tajikistan is considered the country most vulnerable to climate change in Europe and Central Asia. It is leveraging $60.7 million from the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (from CIFs), with more than $80 million from development partners for climate-proofing water management and hydroelectric infrastructure, improving institutional capacities for integrating climate resilience into national development and investment planning, and supporting land management measures to enhance rural livelihoods, the latter of which also includes financing from a GEF grant ($5.4 million) and the International Development Association (IDA). Tajikistan's strategic program for climate resilience has become a model for the region, with Central Asian countries engaged in the preparation of the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Program for the Aral Sea Basin, a platform for increased regional cooperation on climate action. Supporting Jamaica's First Wind Independent Power Producer The $10 million from the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program, alongside $10 million from the IFC and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, financed a 36 megawatt (MW) wind farm   support at least an additional $58 billion from the MDBs and public and private sources, with $35 billion already committed for projects under implementation. These projects will deliver emission reductions of approximately 1.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent over the projects' lifetime--the equivalent of taking 315 million cars off the road--and support more than 30 million people through climate resilience projects. However, the CIFs are already mostly committed, and if they are to continue to play this catalytic role and support the WBG and other MDBs to deliver on their climate mandate, they would need to be recapitalized in the near future. The IFC has built a solid track record in blending concessional funds alongside its investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Over the past five years, the IFC has committed $280 million in concessional finance from multilateral and bilateral sources across multiple sectors and instruments, alongside $1,100 million in IFC investments and $3,800 million from other financiers. The IFC's disciplined blended finance criteria (to ensure additionality beyond what the IFC can do for its own account, targeting and leveraging subsidies to minimize market distortion), and its own account co-investment requirements ensure significant leverage in every transaction. When reviewing all donor fund sources and instruments from FY10 to date, the overall leverage ratio is 1:17. That ratio may become lower if new allocations emphasize challenging areas like infrastructure, agriculture, and IDA countries and fragile and conflict-affected situations. The IFC currently has an unfunded, concept-approved, blended finance pipeline of at least $300 million, mostly in infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa and MNA, which    cannot proceed because of the lack of (geographically and sectorally) flexible concessional finance. If that financing were available, it could leverage at least $500 million of IFC funds and $1.7 billion from other investors. There is an ongoing need for concessional finance, IDA and non-IDA, to support the WBG in accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and expand energy efficiency. Although some renewable energy technologies are now competitive with fossil fuels in several markets, targeted concessional finance will still be needed to accelerate this transition. Concessional financing will help de-risk investments and lower the cost of capital, which is substantially higher in developing countries. Concessional finance can therefore help level the playing field between low-carbon projects and fossil fuel­based technology by addressing viability gaps, such as those associated with high capital costs or different types of risk (such as first-mover risk, technology risk, sovereign risk, and financing risk). In addition, concessional finance will support critical enabling infrastructure, such as transmission, smart grids, and solar parks, to help lower transaction costs and allow higher penetration of renewable energy. Another market barrier that concessional finance could help address is the weak creditworthiness of the power off-takers in many of the markets, which presents a key challenge for attracting private capital. Concessional finance is also needed to fund the incremental costs associated with ""climate proofing"" infrastructure investments and for technical assistance and project preparation work. Even if the incremental costs associated with making infrastructure more resilient to climate change impacts result in savings later and are cost-efficient overall, financing higher upfront costs may be challenging, and there is a strong case for this funding to be made concessional in the smallest, poorest, and most vulnerable countries. In many countries, concessional funding is also needed to support the design of policies, strengthen institutional capacity, and prepare projects, all aimed at expanding the pipeline of financeable climate-smart projects. The WBG will also need sustained, ongoing access to trust fund resources--such as the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)--to support analytic work, policy dialogue, and project preparation activities. Additional concessional funds will be key to supporting the WBG in meeting its new climate targets and mobilizing private sector participation at scale. A strong IDA replenishment will be critical to allowing the WBG to meet the climate objectives set out in this Action Plan, which is based on an IDA18 replenishment comparable to IDA17. In addition, the WBG would need to be able to access further non-IDA concessional climate finance, comparable at least to past amounts, for the areas noted. This kind of non-IDA concessional climate funding (especially through the CIFs and bilateral funds such as the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program) has in the past allowed IDA, IBRD, and IFC to finance climate investments that would not have been possible without this concessional financing. The World Bank, IFC, and MIGA are counting on significant non-IDA concessional financial support to meet the targets in this Action Plan.    Although the WBG is working strategically with the GCF and sees possibilities for strong collaboration, uncertainties exist around how this process will move forward and how much concessional finance might be available from this source. There remains a risk of a global shortage of access to leveraged ""climate finance"" for transformative activities in the critical period from Paris through 2020. Options are being explored and will be considered in June 2016, at the request of the CIF Trust Fund Committee, for the future role of the CIFs to (i) support the MDBs and help them deliver on their increased climate mandates, and (ii) catalyze action where gaps persist in the climate finance architecture. This will include options for: (i) mobilizing more private sector investments at a larger scale by leveraging finance from institutional investors and through a broader offer of risk mitigation instruments in key infrastructure sectors, (ii) catalyzing private sector investments in resilience, (iii) using innovative financial instruments for natural resources, and (iv) enhancing efficiency in the use of public finance by deploying more targeted concessional finance. The WBG will work with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to identify ways to deepen collaboration in the future. The World Bank has been one of the largest implementing agencies for the GEF in the past, with climate change playing a dominant role, contributing substantial leverage to the GEF as a whole, and contributing the largest transformational impacts. Although the total share of GEF funding through the World Bank and other MDBs has fallen over the past two replenishment periods, there are good examples of GEF support that helps enable the WBG to innovate and mainstream climate through larger platforms, like the Sustainable Cities and Amazon Programs, and other investments. The WBG will continue to work with the GEF to mainstream the Paris climate commitments through its ongoing development work, while advocating a continued reduction in transaction costs in the operating model. Under the Paris Agreement, the GEF has been given a renewed mandate on capacity building and support for the NDC process. In the coming months, the WBG will work with the GEF to identify more specific opportunities to collaborate in this regard, especially to support actionable investment strategies. Going forward and regardless of the available resources, the WBG will further enhance the use of concessional financing to increase impact, and leverage private capital. Countries will need the appropriate combination of concessional development finance, concessional climate finance, and other forms of financial and technical support. Concessional climate finance will be concentrated on the incremental cost of climate action, redirecting investment flows, and maximizing impact. The WBG will also work with partners to ensure that policy options (including pricing), institutional practices, and reforms (such as structured bidding and strengthening of off-take agreements in the power sector) are deployed to minimize the required level of concessional finance. As part of the work being done for the CIF Trust Fund Committee, a ""concessionality framework"" will be completed by June 2016 to help more systematically guide when and where and how much concessional    finance would be appropriate in different situations. The IFC will continue to use its rigorous screening, established concessionality and financial sustainability principles, and strong governance framework for its blended finance projects. Although the amounts of climate finance currently available are limited with respect to climate needs, the WBG will continue to facilitate country access to a menu of external climate finance instruments, and work with partners and donors to harmonize, simplify, and rationalize access to concessional finance, especially in forestry, where climate finance remains fragmented, which increases transaction costs. The IFC and the World Bank will continue to coordinate approaches to concessional finance, when the ultimate beneficiary is the private sector, to leverage most effectively the WBG's strengths and minimize market distortions. Over the coming months, in consultation with its shareholders, the WBG will articulate a more comprehensive, integrated strategy on how to balance the need for a robust IDA18 replenishment with the mobilization and management of non-IDA concessional finance, as well as in relation to IBRD/IFC/ MIGA financial capacity discussions in the context of the Forward Look Initiative. These are complex, interrelated strategic questions, and non-IDA concessional resources raise wider strategic issues, which, while very important for the Action Plan, cannot be addressed in its context.    5. Priority III: Scale Up Climate Action To help client countries meet their development and climate objectives, the WBG will deepen and scale up its action in six high-impact areas: (i) renewable energy and energy efficiency; (ii) sustainable mobility; (iii) sustainable and resilient cities; (iv) climate-smart land use, water, and food security; (v) green competitiveness; and (vi) leaving no one behind. The WBG will in particular increase its action toward resilience and adaptation to climate change. The actions in each impact area have been selected and prioritized based on (i) where transformation is an imperative to meet client and global climate goals; (ii) where the WBG has a comparative advantage, has been successful, and can make a difference; and (iii) where client demand or appropriate market conditions are observed in some countries or regions. These actions will involve scaling up what works, deploying existing tools where relevant, developing new tools and solutions (often with partners), piloting in selected countries--ensuring replicability and maximizing the demonstration effect-- and then rolling out more broadly, based on specific demand. Each high- impact area and its related actions are discussed in turn.  Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Renewable energy and energy efficiency are critical for stabilizing climate change and reaching universal access to energy, and require an integrated approach. Around 1.1 billion people worldwide still live without access to electricity. Providing universal access to affordable, reliable, and renewable energy is vital to ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity, with the lowest possible emissions. To ensure that global warming remains below 2°C, it is critical to accelerate improvements in energy efficiency and more rapidly de-carbonize energy supply. The NDCs announced in Paris go a long way in this direction, but still fall short of the 2°C target. Renewable energy--including hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal--is instrumental in reaching this goal. However, renewables cannot scale up without the appropriate enabling environment, governance of the energy system, system planning, and the necessary investment in transmission and distribution, in first-of and high-risk generation capacity, and sometimes in non-renewable production. In the past 15 years, the renewable energy market has grown from 46.8 to 467.9 GW in cumulative capacity. This growth has been supported by significant decreases in the price of renewable energy, coupled with favorable national policies that aim to reduce pollution and increase energy independence. Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that non-hydro renewables, just 6 percent of global electricity in 2014, will reach at least 33 percent of global    electricity production by 2040 (46 percent with hydroelectricity), with most of the projected growth (78 percent) occurring in developing countries. The cumulative installed capacity of large, grid-tied solar in non-OECD countries is expected to require about $1.3 trillion in new capacity investment through 2040. Onshore wind is expected to grow in developing countries by 585 percent through 2040, driven by India, with investments of approximately $1.8 trillion. Hydroelectric capacity will also grow in emerging markets, by about 64 percent, needing approximately $1 trillion in the next 25 years. Energy efficiency investments will also be critical to meeting carbon reduction objectives. These investments are often cost-effective and produce large economic and development co-benefits; many countries have energy efficiency commitments in their NDC. However, challenges remain in implementing business models that work at scale to produce greater energy efficiency. According to the International Energy Agency, 50 percent of the potential for reducing GHG emissions will come from energy efficiency gains. The SE4All initiative and the WBG's Energy Sector Directions Paper form the cornerstone of the WBG's energy objectives. WBG energy financing has topped $49 billion since 2010, of which more than $21 billion was for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects--of this, $5.8 billion was the IFC's own account investments (see box 5.1). Of the balance of $28 billion, most has been to improve access, sector reform, and transmission and distribution.  Box 5.1 Promoting Renewable Power Generation and Energy Efficiency Hydropower in Nepal The world's second richest country in inland water resources, Nepal can meet not just its own electricity needs, but also serve energy-hungry neighbors like Bangladesh and India. Yet, Nepal's 30 million people remain starved for electricity. One major challenge is to address the grid interface for small and micro hydro plants, so the World Bank--with the Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy program--provides policy, operational recommendations, and advice on reforms to government and development partners. The World Bank Group (WBG)--through the International Development Association and International Finance Corporation (IFC)--also approved $84.6 million in financing for Kabeli, the first project-financed hydro plant in the country, with support for the Investment Board of Nepal to improve its ability to facilitate the development of hydro projects in line with international standards. Private Sector Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Turkey The $100 million invested by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF) alongside the $500 million from the World Bank accelerated the development of small hydro and wind energy facilities, and pioneered industrial-scale energy efficiency through the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey and the Development Bank of Turkey. Following the successful implementation of its initial $500 million loan, the World Bank approved an additional $500 million loan in November 2011. Overall, the $100 million in CTF financing leveraged $1.53 billion, and the Development Bank of Turkey and Industrial Development Bank of Turkey were able to attract an additional $1 billion for renewable energy and energy efficiency from other international financiers. The project has financed 960 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity and achieved energy savings of 2,100 Tcal for a total greenhouse gas emission reduction of 3.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Concentrated Solar in South Africa In 2011, South Africa launched a program aimed at awarding 3,600 MW of private sector concessions for renewable energy production, including concentrated solar power (CSP). As is typical with first installations, CSP faced high upfront costs. The IFC's investment in the first two CSP projects--KaXu and Khi--with $41.5 million in concessional finance (CTF) and $154.3 million from the IFC's own account, leveraged an additional $1.2 billion in financing for a total project size of $1.4 billion. The IFC's first-mover position, enabled by strategic use of blended finance, lowered the perceived risk for a new technology and established a track record for CSP that led to a competitive private sector market. Multiple rounds of bids resulted in reduced bid tariffs and project costs for the CSP investments. Green Building Code and Certification Program The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) program provides technical assistance to governments and the private sector on mandatory building codes and voluntary certification, to raise the minimum standards of resource efficiency and carbon intensity while incentivizing private sector innovation and leadership. The EDGE program convenes building sector stakeholders around a metrics-driven vision of green buildings as superior financial assets, contributing to firms' profitability and countries' competitiveness. Partnering with financial institutions, EDGE aims to facilitate $91 billion in green investment a year by FY23.  Since FY11, more than 80 percent of IBRD/IDA lending for power generation has been in renewable energy, with fossil fuel investments limited--as guided by the WBG's Energy Sector Directions Paper--to those justified by emergency situations, strong cases for development impacts, or when they support a transition to a cleaner energy mix. The WBG has not financed any greenfield coal projects since FY10. The IFC has grown its grid-tied renewable energy investment business at a compound annual growth rate of 26 percent over the past 10 years, and the IFC's own account investment in green buildings has reached $1 billion (with $400 million mobilization). Between 2013 and 2015, WBG financing brought new or improved electricity supply to nearly 29 million people. The WBG supports technical assistance through partnerships and trust funds, such as ESMAP and the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.    Recent tools include the Global Tracking Framework to track progress in countries, and the Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy indicators to help countries improve the enabling environment for investing in clean energy and access. The Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) Green Building Market Transformation Program provides advice to governments on building codes and supports green building certification (box 5.1). Codes are in implementation in four countries and in development in three. The EDGE certification is available for 125 emerging markets. Going forward, the WBG will carry out long-term system planning to identify and accelerate the implementation of the most economic low-carbon options in client countries, and support with lending and assistance as appropriate, to help client countries deliver affordable and reliable energy services in a manner that is consistent with their NDCs, the global climate goals, and the WBG's Energy Sector Directions Paper. The WBG will work to lower net carbon emissions from energy generation, transmission, and distribution investment projects, as well as from energy efficiency investments. It will continue to support natural gas in accordance with the Energy Sector Directions Paper. The World Bank will de-risk renewable energy investments, through policy advice, regulatory reforms, direct investment funding, guarantees, and other products, and by reducing resource risks and using development policy financing, the Program for Results, or technical assistance. The indicative cumulative target will be scaled up 20 GW in renewable energy generation over five years, representing a doubling of current World Bank additions to renewable capacity over the previous five-year period. Further, the World Bank will facilitate the expansion of renewable energy by supporting grid infrastructure and systems (for example, grid planning, solar parks, electricity market design, and regulations for grid access and operations), with the aim to enable an additional 10 GW of variable renewable energy sources to become integrated into grids over the next five years. This requires improving the ability of power systems to absorb more variable renewable electricity by investing in: (i) smarter transmission and distribution grids; (ii) hydro storage and, increasingly, electric batteries; (iii) natural gas-based generation to balance variable renewable energy, especially where hydro-based storage is not available; and (iv) expansion of power grid interconnections and scaling-up of regional energy trade to allow efficient utilization of renewable energy resources. The WBG will focus on crowding in private sector funding for clean energy, with the objective of mobilizing $25 billion of commercial funds over FY16­ FY20, more than double the amount mobilized over the past five-year period. Crowding in this funding and expanding access to renewables will require a significant volume of concessional finance. Country-level engagements will be supported by using analytical instruments and tools to engage in upstream dialogue on policies, regulations, and practices. The WBG will support the sharing of good practices, such as the ""Scaling Solar"" initiative in Africa, which replicates transparent bidding with pre-agreed template documents and stapled finance from IFC, MIGA, and World Bank partial risk guarantees, to reduce payment risk from power    off-takers and concessional financing to buy down costs. The WBG will continue to support the recently announced International Solar Alliance, which brings together 122 countries to share knowledge, technology, costs, research and development, innovation, and project financing mechanisms that reduce financing costs for grid and off-grid solar power. The WBG will explore opportunities to facilitate and encourage technological innovation in the energy sector. Innovation will be critical to achieving the level of de-carbonization needed for a 2°C world. The exact nature of the WBG's role in this area will be defined over the next year. The IFC and MIGA will support the growth of grid-connected clean energy by focusing on large hydropower, wind, and solar; continuing to open new markets with ""first-of "" investments; increasing programmatic interventions to remove barriers; and supporting specific instruments (for example, renewable energy performance insurance). The IFC expects financing for grid- connected renewable energy to remain approximately constant--around $1 billion on average. The IFC and MIGA will help industrial and commercial clients directly access renewable energy by financing captive power or brokering power purchase agreements, and increasing investments in commercial/residential rooftop solar and off-grid solar home systems. The IFC is developing de-risking tools and renewable energy insurance that will help facilitate additional outside investment in the distributed renewable market. The objective is a net increase in investments in distributed renewable energy, and the opening of new markets. The World Bank will also ensure that 100 percent of World Bank hydropower and other energy investments are adapted to climate change, and create financial mechanisms to encourage upfront investments in resilient hydropower infrastructure. The IFC will look at resilient hydropower investment opportunities in the private sector, but making climate adaptation the market standard will require time and effort, and concessional finance for some of the first private sector movers will probably be needed. The WBG will invest in energy efficiency, especially in the built environment. The WBG will increase the share of energy efficiency operations in the WBG portfolio, with an initial scale-up in the urban space, which offers large emission reduction potential and where the clearest scale-up models exist. It will ensure that 50 percent of World Bank infrastructure operations in the urban space integrates energy efficiency measures (and reduces CO2 and hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions). By 2020, the WBG aims to support at least 10 operations, investing at least $1 billion to promote energy efficiency and resilient building. The WBG will further explore new business models and implementation strategies for further scaling up industrial and residential energy efficiency and utility demand-side management. The World Bank will develop action plans in two demonstration countries to reduce emissions in the health sector. The IFC will expand energy efficiency credit lines (box 5.2), propose energy efficiency components in corporate loans and green bonds, and increase advisory services for sector-level interventions. It will also ensure that 50 percent of IFC building investments are green certified.    Box 5.2 IFC Promotes Private Sector Financing for Clean Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects Energy Efficiency Credit Lines in Brazil The International Finance Corporation's (IFC's) climate credit lines through local banks help strengthen financial institutions' capacity to on-lend to climate-related projects. In FY15, the IFC provided $100 million from its own account and mobilized an additional $300 million for climate credit lines to Itau Unibanco in Brazil. These funds will be used to on-lend to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other climate-related loans. Boosting Sustainable Energy Financing in Lebanon The IFC together with the IFC­Canada Climate Change Program provided $20 million to Fransabank and its leasing arm, the Lebanese Leasing Company, to promote the first sustainable energy financing in Lebanon. The role of blended finance was instrumental in making this financing package viable, by providing the bank with adequate incentive to offset the additional costs of establishing a new line of business. This project, accompanied by IFC advisory services, is expected to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in Lebanon and set a new standard of sustainable energy financing for other banks to follow.  The World Bank will continue to play a key role as an Implementing Agency of the Montreal Protocol, working to channel Multilateral Fund grants to help countries meet their international regulatory compliance targets, especially where climate impacts and mitigation benefits are highest. The World Bank will support clients to stay at the leading edge of the best feasible technology alternatives to reduce HFCs--which have high greenhouse gas potentials-- especially in the refrigeration and cooling equipment manufacturing sectors, in combination with energy efficiency, helping to transform domestic and international markets. The same technical knowledge will be brought proactively into World Bank operations to help teams and clients identify opportunities in the refrigeration and cooling sectors and boost climate benefit goals. The WBG will work with governments, oil companies, and other development institutions to end ongoing routine flaring of gas at oil production sites around the world by 2030, and to avoid entirely routine flaring at all new oil fields. So far, 17 countries have signed on to the World Bank-led ""Zero Routine Flaring by 2030"" initiative, as have 20 oil companies and 11 development institutions. The initiative aims to cover at least two-thirds of global gas flaring by 2020, compared with more than 40 percent today. The initiative is important because of flaring's considerable climate impacts: emissions of CO2, methane, and black carbon (soot). Flaring is a major source of the black carbon that deposits on the Arctic snow and ice cap, accelerating melting. Ending flaring is also good resource management--if converted to electricity, the gas flared around the world could produce more electricity than what is currently consumed on the entire African continent.    Sustainable Mobility Sustainable mobility is needed to achieve countries' development and climate objectives, and the transport sector needs deeper action on climate adaptation and resilience. Actions to stabilize climate change will fall short if they do not include the transport sector. Investments in low-carbon solutions are urgently needed in the sector, and opportunities exist in the design of public transport, vehicle efficiency, demand management, regional development, and land use. An estimated 30 percent reduction in carbon emissions is thought to be possible by 2030 from new information and communications technologies (ICT). But transport is also vulnerable to climate risk, which can affect the entire transport value chain: new and existing transport systems urgently need greater investment in resilience. The challenge is how to respond to rising global demand for mobility and greater interconnectedness in a sustainable manner while improving the resilience of transport networks. With 76 percent of NDCs including transport actions, there is strong potential demand from clients to address climate change in the sector. Currently, over FY11­FY15, the World Bank's contribution in transport and ICT to climate benefits is $7.3 billion (26 percent), driven by urban mobility and railways, with a strong regional focus on EAP, LCR, and SAR (box 5.3). Climate co-benefits in adaptation reached $373 million over the period. Transport has the second largest volume of climate co-benefits in the World Bank. The MDBs made a concerted move at the 2012 United Nations (UN) Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), where they pledged $175 billion in loans and grants for more sustainable transport over the  2012­22 decade. At COP21 in Paris, the MDBs joined forces to commit to ramp up climate action in transport. The WBG will help countries develop sustainable mobility alternatives and implement transport adaptation options, especially in lagging regions. The WBG will increase the share of the transport portfolio that contributes to mitigation and resilience. It will pursue sustainable urban mobility opportunities across all regions and multimodal freight operations in several portfolios. It aims to reach $2 billion in lending for adaptation over FY16­ FY20 (four times the level in the previous five-year period) and enhance the resilience of the road portfolio. The WBG will partner with the GFDRR and other donors to create a knowledge platform to build climate resilience in the roads sector. The IFC will build on existing engagements with municipal clients and develop new relationships with creditworthy cities that are looking to address congestion and mobility issues. This scale-up of investment will be paired with targeted analytical work, to provide advisory services to countries that need support for identifying specific interventions in the transport sector (for example, for future NDCs and trucking, fuels, and vehicles). In particular, the WBG will focus on improving the competitiveness and fuel efficiency of the trucking sectors and promoting green freight, and on investing in capacity building on adaptation. The WBG will lead a global coalition to develop a framework for sustainable mobility. The World Bank has been tasked with leading the transport track of the Climate Action 2016 Summit, which will take place May 5­6, 2016. This will deepen and expand the multi-stakeholder action coalitions launched at the UN Secretary-General's Climate Summit in 2014. The summit provides an opportunity to link the transport-related climate change and sustainable development agendas, and bring coherence and clarification of goals to the international community.  Sustainable and Resilient Cities Cities are hotspots for global emissions and climate vulnerability. With more than 80 percent of global GDP generated in cities, urbanization can contribute to sustainable growth. Significant urbanization is expected in the coming decades in all regions. Cities are responsible for 80 percent of GHG emissions, and up to 80 percent of adaptation costs are expected to be borne in urban areas. Building sustainable and resilient cities requires an integrated and multisector approach that combines planning, policies and regulations, and investments. Delayed action would create lock-ins in high-risk or carbon- intensive patterns. In particular, buildings offer a large potential for immediate, cost-effective action with short-term development gains through lower energy expenditures, better comfort, and higher resilience. Tackling urban development in an integrated way is essential for meeting climate change mitigation and adaptation challenges and is in line with many countries' NDCs. In the past 10 years, World Bank commitments for cities almost doubled, to an annual average of $4.11 billion (FY09­FY13) and several resilient cities   initiatives have been established. The urban strategy aims to ensure that urbanization is managed for resilient, inclusive, and sustainable growth (box 5.4). Urbanization Reviews have been completed in 14 countries. The WBG helps reduce the climate impact on cities through investments in waste, water, transport, and buildings. The Global Platform for Sustainable Cities promotes an integrated approach to sustainable urban planning and management and will serve as a key knowledge platform to connect and support   integrated solutions. The Resilient Cities Program aims to help cities adapt and withstand shocks while maintaining essential functions, with CityStrength Diagnostic and City Creditworthiness Academies. ESMAP's City Energy Efficiency Transformation Program helps identify, develop, and mobilize financing for investment programs in urban energy efficiency. Through its focus on climate-smart urban development, the IFC has invested in transport, waste, and green buildings--for example, with investments in public transit deals in the cities of Izmir and Istanbul in Turkey (with MIGA), and Bogotá in Colombia and Lima in Peru, through the IFC's subnational lending program. Going forward, the WBG will further integrate climate into urban planning. The WBG will support cities directly and by developing tools and knowledge products through the Global Platform for Sustainable Cities, and roll these out in at least 30 cities by 2020. The WBG will develop and pilot in 15 cities by 2020 a city-based resilience approach that integrates infrastructure development, land use planning, DRM, institutions/governance, social components, and infrastructure investment. It will scale up the cross-GPs team that provides assistance to task team leaders (TTLs) on incorporating the principles of integrated urban water management (multi-stakeholder, integrating urban, environment, water supply, sanitation planning, and investments) to improve efficiencies and outcomes, to ensure climate resilience. To ensure consistency between infrastructure development and urbanization, the WBG will develop and pilot solution packages for transit-oriented development. By 2020, transport-oriented development solution packages will be piloted in at least five cities. The IFC and MIGA will increase investments in municipal transport, leveraging advisory engagements to create the pipeline.  Climate-Smart Land Use, Water, and Food Security Climate-smart land use is central for food security and resilience, poverty reduction, GHG emission reductions, and natural resource protection. More than one billion people are undernourished today; the world will need to produce at least 50 percent more food by 2050. With current practices, the world will face a 40 percent shortfall between the forecasted demand and available supply of water by 2030. Climate-smart land use, applied across the agricultural, forestry, fisheries, and conservation sectors, can increase food production and farmers' income while offering large opportunities for climate resilience, emissions reduction, more sustainable water use, and carbon sequestration. Land use­related emissions currently represent 19 to 29 percent of global GHG emissions, over half of which is caused by deforestation. At COP21, leading global agribusiness leaders outlined their ambition to make 50 percent more food available and strengthen the resilience of farming communities while reducing GHG emissions by 50 percent.  Climate-smart land use includes different components: (i) climate-smart agriculture, an approach to better managing the food and agricultural system to simultaneously increase productivity and resilience, and reduce GHG emissions (box 5.5); (ii) forestry; (iii) land restoration; (iv) ecosystem-based adaptation and coastal area management projects; and (v) improved water management, including groundwater. These actions all seek to enhance the ways in which our natural capital can protect people's assets in the face of climate change, and enhance their incomes through ecosystem services, water supply, and flood protection. The WBG has a large portfolio in agriculture, water, forestry, and environmental management. Currently, the WBG is scaling up climate-smart agriculture, has been financing many projects with forestry components, and has played a catalytic role in sustainable land management. In 2015, the WBG committed $8 billion ($4.7 IBRD/IDA and $3.2 billion IFC) to    agriculture and related sectors; 42 percent of the Agriculture GP's pipeline projects deliver climate-smart agriculture, and the World Bank has committed to 100 percent of agriculture operations being climate-smart by 2019. The World Bank portfolio also includes approximately $22 billion in lending in the water sector. The WBG has financed $15.7 billion in projects with forestry components (2002­15), and manages about $2.2 billion in climate finance for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, Conservation of Forest Stocks, Sustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement of Forest Carbon Stocks (REDD+). In sustainable land management, the WBG has played a catalytic role from China to Ethiopia, and committed at COP21 to restore 100 million hectares (ha) of degraded land in Africa, at a cost of approximately $750 million. In coastal zones, the WBG has $1 billion in projects with resilience and coastal fisheries benefits. Going forward, the WBG will deliver on climate-smart agriculture at scale to increase the efficiency and resilience of food systems. Climate-smart agriculture profiles and investment plans will be developed by 2020 for at least 40 countries, and climate-smart agriculture programs will be delivered at scale under six focal areas: (i) the introduction of hybrid seeds and carbon capture practices for major crops, including scaling of agroforestry, in three regions; (ii) the implementation at scale of high-efficiency/low-energy-use irrigation programs in the Africa, South Asia, and Middle-East and North Africa regions (AFR/SAR/MNA); (iii) livestock productivity increases through ""feed and breed"" and simultaneously pursuing emission reductions with manure management/ biodigesters; (iv) leveraged private capital and purchasing to increase the medium-term capital flow for producers, to develop resilient supply chains, aimed at having at least 10 initiatives linking food supply chains with smallholders, thereby increasing resilience and reducing emissions by 2020; (v) energy solutions for agribusiness (for example, solar and biogas); and (vi) mainstreamed risk assessment and management, including using suitable insurance products. The IFC will examine how to increase agricultural adaptation investments, including building resilience into agricultural supply chains. Investments in the agricultural sector are expected to require concessional finance and innovative financing models, such as weather index insurance. The WBG will also scale up its interventions on forests via the implementation of the new Forest Action Plan (FAP) FY16­FY20. The Forest Action Plan seeks to fully embed forests in the development priorities of countries, by focusing more deliberately on the positive contributions that forests make to poverty reduction, food security, economic development, and the climate action agenda. The FAP builds on an in-depth assessment of the WBG's forest portfolio over the FY02­FY15 period as well as a detailed analysis of the emerging demands coming from clients (in particular through their NDCs). The FAP articulates the WBG's value proposition to tackle the forest challenge with sustainable results, and identifies two focus areas for WBG engagement for the next five years: (i) sustainable forestry, where the WBG aims to have investments contributing to sustainable management of forests and value chains, and (ii) forest-smart interventions, where the WBG aims to    have interventions in other sectors not come at the expense of forest capital. These two focus areas build on three cross-cutting themes that aim to improve the enabling environment and strengthen the foundations for positive forest outcomes: climate change and resilience, rights and participation; and institutions and governance. Under the first focus area, priority actions are to (i) protect and optimize the management of natural forests, (ii) encourage sustainable plantations and tree planting, and (iii) support sustainable forest value chains (for timber and non-timber forest products). Under the second focus area, the WBG aims to support clients to promote growth that does not come at the expense of their natural forests, and that properly values and recognizes the contribution of forest services to the economy; it will aim to promote forest-smart interventions in other sectors (such as agriculture, transport, energy, and extractives) that consider avoiding or minimizing their potential adverse impact on forests. To do so, interventions in forests and other economic sectors will be guided by comprehensive, ex ante, and robust information on potential tradeoffs for forests as well as opportunities for restoration. By 2020, the WBG aims to support REDD+ strategies in more than 50 countries, develop/implement a large-scale, multisector program promoting ""forest-smart"" development and mobilizing IBRD/IDA/REDD+ financing in 10 countries, and prepare Country Forestry Notes in at least 20 countries. The WBG will also work with partners and donors to improve the effectiveness of forest climate funds, to reduce transaction costs and increase impact. In the short term, it will work to improve country-level coordination, whereas in the medium term it may need to work toward rationalization of funds and financial innovation to improve the performance of results-based instruments while addressing short-term investment funding needs. The WBG will produce a series of area-based operations in climate-sensitive locations using ecosystem-based adaptation (natural infrastructure), land restoration, integrated water management, and biodiversity conservation, to maximize the development benefits and carbon sinks (the target is five operations in 2020) (box 5.6). It will strive to integrate landscape-scale planning into infrastructure planning, support the clarification of property rights, improve land use controls, and include considerations of climate impact inequality. The World Bank will also ensure that 50 percent of adaptation projects include ecosystem-based adaptation measures by 2020. Moreover, the WBG will continue to play its role as a strategic partner in many international efforts, like the Bonn Challenge, Global Landscape Forum, and Wealth Accounting and the Valuation of Ecosystem Services global partnership on ecosystem services and their valuation. By 2020, actions will be underway to restore 20 million ha in LCR and 100 million ha in Africa, with results seen by 2030; 15 landscape restoration operations will have been developed in Central Asia, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Vietnam; and environmentally sustainable livelihood alternatives will have been implemented in 50 coastal communities in West Africa. The WBG will also promote climate-proof fisheries management by focusing on critical marine ecosystems in the face of climate-induced   changes (for example, higher water temperatures, increased salinization, and shifting currents). This includes the development of better monitoring systems, research, and capacity to make more informed decisions, and the strengthening links with the ""blue economy."" The expanded approach will be piloted in 10 regionally diverse but heavily fisheries-dependent countries by 2020. The WBG will implement large-scale national and transboundary programs to promote water efficiency across sectors, improved water management (including groundwater), and allocation mechanisms (box 5.7). It will also produce analytical work on and provide support to countries in developing an integrated water-energy-food nexus.    Box 5.7 The Niger River Basin Management Project In the Niger Basin, countries understand the need for investment and cooperative action to overcome the water and development challenges they face and to build climate resilience. In addition to their own national-level plans and investment pipelines, the countries have taken several important steps toward shared planning, management, and development of the Niger Basin, including establishing the Niger Basin Authority (NBA); approving the Niger Basin Water Charter in 2008; and developing and approving the Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP) in 2007, which emphasizes development of socioeconomic infrastructure, preservation of ecosystems in the basin, capacity building, and stakeholder participation. A related $8.2 billion investment program was adopted in April 2008. Building on this momentum, the Niger Basin countries asked the World Bank to support their efforts to prepare an ""Investment Plan for the Strengthening of Resilience to Climate Change in the Niger River Basin"" (CRIP), to identify and elevate the visibility of the important climate adaptation and resilience investments that are needed in the Niger Basin. CRIP, as a subset of SDAP, was prepared through a thorough participatory process, including the nine Niger River riparian countries and led by the NBA, with support from the World Bank and the African Development Bank, and launched during the COP21. The World Bank is now in the process of assisting the NBA and Niger Basin countries in grouping the first priority actions into thematically homogeneous packages. These themes include (i) climate-dependent rural livelihoods, (ii) climate variability, and (iii) water stress (as well as a few other actions that aim at reducing the Niger Basin's vulnerability to soil degradation and the rising sea level). Underpinning each of these themes is a critical Knowledge and Governance package, which includes vulnerability assessments, integrated adaptation, resilience planning for national and regional institutions, and hydro-meteorological information and systems. The World Bank is considering mobilizing a significant amount from International Development Association resources--on the order of $275 million under the first theme--and helping the NBA and Niger Basin countries mobilize the required amounts for the other two themes.  Green Competitiveness Green competitiveness offers large potential for development benefits and is an important building block for the transition toward zero net emissions. There is growing demand from client countries to involve their private sectors in emerging green business lines and create green jobs. Currently, the Climate Technology Program has seven Climate Innovation Centers around the world, helping nearly 300 companies to scale up innovative and commercial climate solutions. Today, the IFC's Venture Capital group has $122 million invested in 12 climate-related businesses in its portfolio, including in energy storage, agriculture, and software companies, in addition to the solar home system companies. Going forward, the WBG will support green, innovative sectors in developing countries. There is demand from client countries to involve their private   sectors in growing climate-related sectors and create jobs. The market is large: up to $6.4 trillion will be invested in climate-related sectors in developing countries in the coming decade, including energy efficiency, water supply, and climate-smart agriculture. In 2015, clean tech venture capital investments grew to $3.3 billion. In some countries, the WBG would support more systematic analytical/advisory work on the role that green and climate-smart development can play as a new driver of growth. The WBG will support innovation in emerging clean tech markets, enhanced industrial competitiveness, and business and entrepreneurs (see box 5.8 for an example). The WBG will pilot innovative approaches to support clients' climate technology ecosystems and industrial competitiveness by facilitating policy and regulations to catalyze private investment and green trade. It will respond to market failures exacerbated by climate change, with solutions to reduce energy consumption, water use, and waste in industrial processes, thereby realizing a sizable reduction in industrial emissions and increasing competitiveness. Further opportunities with equipment manufacturers and through supply chains will be developed. By 2020, the WBG aims to have assisted 20 countries in enhancing their capacity to adopt new climate solutions and increase industrial competitiveness in response to climate change. This assistance aims to include eight new Climate Innovation Centers and support to 10 countries to increase industry resilience to climate change. Areas of focus will include greening global value chains and trade practices, establishing eco-industrial zones, and developing best practices for standards and labeling. The IFC will intensify its work throughout the finance value chain for entrepreneurs, from incubators through private equity, to increase its impact and grow the market in climate-smart innovation. By 2020, the IFC will have increased its early-stage investments in key new markets, including the Internet of Things, distributed systems, and business model innovation.  Leaving No One Behind In recent years, the WBG has focused on policy development to support the people most vulnerable to climate change (box 5.9). Poor people are more exposed, more vulnerable, and less able to cope with and recover from climate shocks. The WBG will be a voice for the poor and vulnerable, and ensure that  climate policies and impacts do not slow down poverty reduction. Extremely vulnerable groups include the very poor--those without access to basic infrastructure services and social protection--children, women and the elderly, indigenous populations, refugees and migrants, and people living in extremely vulnerable areas such as small islands and deltas.    IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world's 77 poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa, and is the single largest source of donor funds for basic social services in these countries. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, IDA commitments totaled $19 billion (including climate and non-climate operations). Since 2005, the IFC has committed $3.5 billion in 219 climate projects in IDA countries and in FY15, 50 percent of the IFC's blended climate finance co-investments went to projects in IDA countries. Climate change is one of the four thematic areas in IDA17, and IDA action helps build poor people's resilience. The WBG has targeted action on some of the groups most vulnerable to climate change, particularly through (i) the REDD+ readiness process, which has deepened the participation of and collaboration with indigenous peoples; (ii) the recently revised gender strategy; and (iii) specific strategies on very vulnerable countries, such as small islands (with specific IDA allocation and programs) and fragile states and conflict areas (with a commitment to increase IDA financing to fragile and conflict-affected situation countries by 50 percent), which can also contribute to building climate resilience. Building people's resilience to prepare for and respond to climate disasters is critical to managing climate impacts and eradicating poverty. Between 1994 and 2013, 6,873 natural disasters worldwide were recorded, which claimed 1.35 million lives or almost 68,000 lives on average each year. The cumulative economic losses from disasters since 2000 are close to $2.5 trillion. Climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of disasters in many regions. Making people--especially the most vulnerable--more resilient to climate- related shocks is essential to eradicate poverty. The $1.2 billion Pilot Program for Climate Resilience already assists developing countries in integrating climate resilience into development planning. Going forward, the WBG will support universal access to hydromet information and early warning with client countries and international partners (for example, through the Climate Risk Early Warning Systems and the Global Framework for Climate Services). The WBG increased its contribution to DRM from 9.4 to 12.0 percent of the portfolio between FY12 and FY15, that is, from $3.7 billion to $5.7 billion. The Hydromet Program has already supported modernized weather, climate, and hydrological services in countries around the world. The WBG will help build the institutions, observation systems, decision-making processes, and service delivery focus. By 2020, the goal is that an additional 100 million people in 15 developing countries, including least developed countries and small island developing states, will have access to high-quality hydromet data and early warning systems. To achieve this, the WBG will mobilize resources to support universal access to climate information and core climate services. The WBG will help scale up adaptive social protection, by creating a multi-GP team and providing solution packages to support this work. The WBG also supports innovative adaptive social protection systems, including in Ethiopia and Pakistan. By 2020, the aim is to scale up these services so that an additional 50 million people will be covered by climate-adaptive social protection schemes, and be better able to cope with natural disasters and other shocks.    The WBG will also scale up sovereign disaster risk financing. In 2014 alone, World Bank projects in more than 12 countries helped improve financial resilience, with better post-disaster financial response capacity. Significant programs are already in place in the Pacific and the Caribbean. The aim is to add five more countries covered by financial protection instruments, including insurance, risk pools, and contingent finance, by 2020. Beyond sovereign schemes, the WBG is currently working with local government units (for example, in the Philippines) to provide financial cover for natural disasters. The World Bank will work to expand this, if successful, to other countries. It will also develop and expand contingent finance instruments for IDA countries. The WBG will scale up and expand the use of community-driven development approaches to strengthen resilience at the local level. By 2020, ex ante resilience investments will be integrated into seven community-driven development country programs. Specific interventions will also include programs for the most vulnerable locations (for example, small islands) and populations (for example, migrants and refugees). The WBG will scale up the Small Island States Resilience Initiative to build capacity and for better use of existing, fragmented funds, and mobilize increased financing for small island states. The WBG will (i) facilitate scaled-up and more efficient resource flows, among others, by increasing absorption capacity and institutional capacity; (ii) strengthen global knowledge of the specific needs and challenges of small islands; and (iii) strengthen implementation support (by building capacity for eventual direct access to global climate funds, etc.). The WBG will also produce a flagship analytical report on climate change and migration/conflict (FY17). The WBG will strengthen and reinforce action on climate and health. Subject to available resources, the WBG will increase its capacity to respond to the 32 IBRD and 40 IDA-eligible countries that have included health as a focus area in their NDCs, with expectations that by the end of FY17, two countries will have vulnerability assessments; by the end of FY18, two countries will have climate-smart surveillance and early warning systems; and by the end of FY19, 75 percent of TTLs will be trained in climate change and health, and 20 percent of new health, nutrition, and population projects will consider climate in their design.    6. Priority IV: Align Internal Processes and Work with Others To enhance its impact and support its client countries, the WBG will strengthen its partnerships, internal processes, and organization.  Work in Partnership with Others The WBG already has a very large set of partnerships in the climate change domain, with other development actors, the research and academic communities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and business groups and associations. Some of these partnerships are broad and highly strategic--such as the work with other MDBs--while others are targeted (for example, on some methodological issues). To complement its own action, the WBG will work with others to benefit from what they do best, and ensure synergies across actors in the field. But partnerships will be more selective and strategic, so that more synergies can be captured between WBG operations and the actions of other actors. The WBG will align with other MDBs and international development finance agencies on mainstreaming principles and reporting, and with MDBs and bilaterals on strategies and work programs. The WBG will strengthen collaboration with leading think tanks, research groups, NGOs, and business alliance groups (for example, World Resources Institute, We Mean Business, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Tropical Forest Alliance, New Climate Economy, Global Green Growth Institute, and IPCC), including on coordinated analytical work and country support. The WBG will build on work already started, to increase collaboration with the International Monetary Fund on fossil fuel subsidies, carbon pricing, and the fiscal implications of climate change, especially for small island states. The IFC will join international initiatives such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, We Mean Business, and other business initiatives that mobilize the private sector to move the needle on emission reductions. The IFC is also convening a joint MDB Task Force on private investment leveraging that will allow the MDBs to report accurately the financial impact of their climate action. The WBG will also further develop strategic relationships with partners active in climate finance. It will further include climate considerations in the GFDRR--for instance on urban resilience. The WBG will work to incorporate climate considerations in the Global Infrastructure Facility, support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change processes--as appropriate--and continue and strengthen country-level and regional partnerships. The WBG will build and expand on CIF and MDB partnerships to    catalyze actions where there are gaps and where the CIF is well positioned to support the WBG in delivering on its ambitious climate targets. The GCF could be a significant partner for co-investment, building pipeline, and increasing countries' readiness for direct access. However there are still uncertainties at this time. The World Bank and IFC are now both accredited as GCF Implementing Agencies. The GCF has received pledges amounting to $10.3 billion, of which $6.9 billion has been paid in. The GCF is still hoping to approve projects amounting to $2.5 billion in 2016. It has so far approved $168 million, and more projects will be approved at the next board meeting in June 2016. The WBG (and MDBs) have the capacity to deploy resources at scale and in transformational ways on behalf of the GCF, and MDBs could be an especially important channel for countries with weak capacity. The World Bank has started to build a pipeline of projects for the GCF, with initial proposals pending approval for $86 million. The WBG has engaged with the GCF more strategically, with early discussions on projects estimated at $600 million. There is an opportunity for the WBG to provide readiness support for countries to build institutional capability and move toward accreditation to enable direct access. The WBG will continue to work closely with the GCF, trying to develop a strategic programmatic partnership, but strategic and technical issues would need to be resolved. Expectations will need to be managed in the medium term.  Global Advocacy on Key Issues The WBG will advance selected climate issues through focused global advocacy, focusing on issues on which the WBG has an established voice and that can facilitate large-scale climate action. Such priority topics include carbon pricing--building on momentum from Paris, the CPLC, and the Carbon Pricing Panel; fossil fuel subsidy reforms; issues related to inclusion and poverty and the imperative to leave no one behind; integration of climate into finance for development (including advocating well-targeted and well-scaled blended concessional finance); and increasing private sector capacity and building private sector markets. Moreover, additional issues will be selected annually for a special advocacy effort, such as issues related to climate change and water during 2016. The IFC will contribute to the dialogue through blogs and articles that share lessons learned. This advocacy work will also take place through participation and leadership in key external events, such as the Spring and Annual Meetings, regular global events such as the World Economic Forum, the Climate Week and UN General Assembly, G20/G7 meetings, the Climate Action 2016 summit, COP22, and major thematic meetings such as the World Humanitarian Summit, Habitat III, and the World Cities Summit. The WBG will also support COP22 by assisting the host country and pushing forward its clients' agenda. In particular, it will support the Moroccan government, as the host and to demonstrate the leadership the country has shown, with WBG help, on the low-carbon agenda. The WBG will continue its leading role in global advocacy on specific topics (including carbon pricing, renewable energy, and the blue economy). COP22 will be implementation-focused, with objectives that align with the WBG's agenda for its clients and advocacy. In particular, COP22 can support the delivery of new financial tools that are innovative and able to mobilize private sector flows and unlock public sector resources; facilitate technology transfers and capacity support of new and emerging technologies; increase and accelerate the financing of adaptation; and enhance transparency through, for example, setting up metrics for the NDCs. In that framework, the WBG can in particular build on the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, by creating new and implementing existing coalitions and partnerships, including on transport, renewables, adaptation, forests, water, agriculture, and climate security.  Build the Knowledge Base and Create New Solution Packages The WBG is a leader in analytical work and data collection on climate-related issues, has produced major influential reports on climate, and has co- developed or shared many global best practices. The WBG has a rich history of developing and implementing overall standards--notably IFC Performance Standards, which have become global benchmarks--as well as sector-specific standards, such as IFC's EDGE standard for green buildings and Climate Assessment for Financial Intermediary Investment, which enables financial intermediary clients to monitor climate results. With its development partners, the WBG has invested in monitoring and evaluation and developing new metrics to measure the impacts and results of climate policies and projects. The WBG is actively promoting learning--targeting staff and country counterparts, organizing conferences, and investing massively in new technologies for training, for instance, through the Open Learning Campus. The WBG implements and advocates an ""open data"" approach, a major component for evidence-based policies. Open data are particularly important for DRM and climate change adaptation, considering the need to include risk information and data in planning and design decisions. The 2016 World Development Report, Digital Dividends, and the recent Shock Waves reports emphasize the potential development and resilience gains from better access to environmental and climate data. Going forward, the WBG will improve the design and implementation of household surveys, to ensure it has the data needed to understand the climate-related challenges countries face and design better solutions. By 2020, 15 developing countries will have introduced climate-related components in their household data collection. The WBG will maintain thought leadership that contributes and disseminates key pieces of analytical work, and strengthen knowledge sharing activities. At least four flagship reports on climate change will be published and disseminated by 2020. Suggested topics include helping countries manage the fossil fuel transition; the distributional impacts of climate policies; resilient infrastructure; metrics for measuring policy outcomes on resilience and carbon emissions; migration, climate change, and resilience; climate change and cities; and climate change, gender, and poverty. The WBG will also continue doing regional and country-level analytical work, as needed, and produce country-level reports. The WBG will also build on its strong track record to develop and roll out decision support tools and metrics for staff and clients, to help them understand the implications of their own development pathways and improve policies for low-carbon, climate-resilient development--for example, the IFC's EDGE, ESMAP's Tool for Rapid Assessment of City Energy, and the Climate Policy Team's Climate Action for Urban Sustainability Tool. The WBG will continue ongoing work to define resilience indicators at the project and national levels, and develop methodologies to measure the outcomes of emission-reduction policies. The WBG will work in partnership to increase the impact of analytical work. In particular, it will partner with NGOs, UN technical agencies, think tanks, research centers, and key businesses to leverage and share lessons learned, and produce co-branded reports and analyses. It will work within international standard-setting groups to bring usable, ""science-based standards,"" and new technology innovations to its clients as they seek to set ambitious climate targets. It will also participate as an observer at the IPCC and contribute staff to future IPCC reports.  Organizational Capability and Collaboration to Deliver All WBG units have put in place structures to mainstream climate change into their activities and operations. The country departments, GPs, and global industry departments have the responsibility for determining and delivering operational programs. In the World Bank's regions, the focal points take the lead on climate change for the regional strategies. The Regional Leadership Teams have regular review meetings on climate change priorities and progress. Most of the World Bank's GPs have a member of the GP's Leadership Team serving as the climate change focal point, and some have dedicated teams focusing on this issue. The IFC has developed a Climate Business Network that includes one climate anchor from each industry department and from each region, advisory, and operational unit. The IFC's Climate Business Department, which is part of the CCSA, coordinates the network, develops strategy, and provides key centralized support. The Climate Change CCSA works with all WBG units to provide targeted, cross-cutting climate support to clients. The CCSA will continue to develop innovative solutions that have the potential to be scaled up, and support other WBG units on cross-cutting, climate-related issues. It will step up its technical support to operations for lending, analytical work, and mobilization of private sector climate finance. In collaboration with others in the WBG, the CCSA helps shape the overall WBG climate strategy. The CCSA will oversee    and support the implementation and updating, as needed, of the Climate Change Action Plan; advance further strategic analysis of climate-related issues, enabling the optimal use of concessional finance; and promote crossWBG interventions. The CCSA is also the interlocutor/spokesperson for the WBG on cross-cutting global dialogue on climate change issues, working closely with the GPs, which lead externally on sector-specific climate issues. The CCSA also leads on relevant corporate functions, including the development of indicators, leading the climate theme for IDA, and monitoring IDA commitments to ensure compliance. The CCSA hosts global climate funds, including the CIFs, the IFC-Canada Climate Change Program, Forest Funds, and Carbon Funds, and will lead the efforts to streamline and simplify access to these funds, and reduce the fragmentation of climate finance.  Align Internal Processes and Incentives The WBG will align internal processes, metrics, and incentives to support the implementation of the Action Plan. These processes include Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPFs), which will consider the risks and opportunities created by climate change and countries' climate priorities; project design, which will consider climate risks; and monitoring indicators, which will include new indicators to help the WBG track its progress in implementing the Action Plan. The World Bank's GPs and regions, World Bank's Treasury, IFC's global industry departments, and MIGA will work together--with the support of the Climate Change CCSA--to create and fulfill demand for climate change action. The WBG will take climate change into account in its country strategies. The WBG will ensure that SCDs consider available climate information and data to examine the potential impact of climate change on future poverty reduction, and adaptation and resilience priorities and needs. Where appropriate, SCDs will also take into account the implications of a country's energy mix and proposed shifts to a lower-carbon economy, as articulated in the NDC. The WBG will also ensure that the CPFs addresses climate change issues and risks as appropriate for each country--in line with current guidance--and include, when and where it is appropriate, NDC priorities and the multiple available sources of financing to increase the climate-related contributions of WBG-financed projects. The WBG will also ensure that its operations take climate change risks into account. It plans to extend risk screening to IBRD operations in early 2017, after a review of existing tools and the lessons drawn from application to IDA countries. The IFC will start screening some sectors after testing and validating its climate impact risk screening tool; this is expected to be done by September 2016 and to lay the basis for the IFC's path forward. The World Bank will also build gender considerations into its climate screening tools (FY17), and take stock of lessons learned from the incorporation of gender issues into climate change considerations and adapt those tools as needed (FY18). The ongoing work on resilience and ""decision making under    uncertainty"" methodologies will help standardize sector approaches and reduce the cost and help connect TTLs and investment officers with experts. To measure its project impacts, the WBG will continue to roll out GHG accounting and account for carbon emissions, and resulting risk, in its project evaluations. It will generalize and formalize project-level economic analysis with and without a social value for carbon in all World Bank projects subject to GHG accounting, based on a forthcoming discount rate guidance note. The IFC will also further explore tools to include carbon risks in the best possible way in its decision-making process. All WBG buildings-related operations will conduct an economic analysis on a lifecycle basis and account for energy and resource efficiency. The World Bank will review by June 2018--and improve if needed--the ""social value of carbon"" guidance note, based on new science and application to World Bank operations. The WBG will align incentives rewarding WBG collaboration, external funds mobilization, and cross-sector operations. To do so, it will develop, implement, and report new mobilization and catalyzing metrics, and explore moving from measuring inputs of climate finance to measuring impact and leverage. In particular, it will review and enhance, as needed, mobilization metrics for corporate scorecards and memorandums of understanding, to increase incentives for private sector leverage. The WBG will work to use WBG financing in a way that builds climate investments without distorting nascent markets. To facilitate cross-sector operation, it will facilitate shared budgets across GPs for multi-GP projects, and encourage multisector and cross IFC­World Bank­MIGA teams in selected high-priority areas. Finally, the WBG will strengthen, streamline, and harmonize monitoring, reporting, and evaluation for climate action (resilience indicators, GHG accounting, and climate co-benefits) to improve results frameworks, build capacity, and facilitate evidence-based learning. It will develop new indicators to track progress (for example, resilience indicators) and apply them to support policy dialogue (for example, the Readiness for Investment in Sustainable Energy Index). The WBG continues to track the emissions of investment lending projects to capture the development impact. The World Bank will join the IFC in tracking gross emissions and will calculate sector-level gross emissions-based intensity metrics, allowing the World Bank to track performance over time. The World Bank will start reporting annually the net emission impact, and the IFC will continue to report net emission reductions. The WBG will harmonize as much as possible its methodologies with those of the other major development partners. Over the next 18 months, the WBG will continue to develop and mainstream metrics and indicators to measure the outcomes of WBG operations, and move monitoring and evaluation from inputs to outcomes. However, the WBG will avoid creating a bias toward actions that have quantifiable outcomes versus actions that are essential but difficult to monitor in outcome terms. The outcomes of some of the priority actions under this plan (for example, toward resilience or through institutional building) are notably difficult to quantify, but should not be put at a disadvantage by the results framework.    Going forward, the WBG will increase access to knowledge and data by all staff. By the end of FY16, it will create a one-stop shop to provide TTLs with climate information (for example, climate risks and NDCs) and help TTLs blend climate finance (CIF, GEF, GCF, and others) and use carbon finance instruments. The IFC already has its Blended Climate Finance Unit to serve as a one-stop shop, and plans to increase internal knowledge management through workshops, webinars, and the integration of climate into its training weeks. The WBG will ensure that its staff--and its counterparts as appropriate--are trained on the challenges created by climate change. It will develop and roll out training on climate essentials in the context of the Paris Agreement, with a focus on NDCs, and include climate change in the WBG staff curriculum. The target is to provide basic climate change training to all WBG staff by FY18. It will build a climate change practitioners community of practice among the 1,200+ staff working on climate change across the WBG, and strengthen the knowledge management system, to collate and share the operational knowledge created and collected by the GPs, IFC, and MIGA. And the WBG will support the development of client and national stakeholders, including private sector capacity, to identify and implement priority climate actions, enable multisector engagements, and create new opportunities for the private sector. The WBG will also scale up climate change knowledge through a new generation of innovative capacity-building products, including facilitated e-learning, Massive Open Online Courses, and learning modules through the World Bank's Open Learning Campus. Because meeting climate objectives requires innovative and ambitious measures, this Action Plan will require experimentation, learning, monitoring, and regular revisions. It is to be expected that some of the actions under this plan--especially the ones involving the development and piloting of new approaches--will meet unexpected obstacles, while others will deliver more than is expected. The plan's results framework aims for 75 percent of the listed actions having a measurable impact by 2020. This Action Plan is based on a background note from the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group on lessons drawn from past action plans, and this collaboration will be maintained in the future. The WBG will adjust its strategy as it learns from mistakes and successes, supported by progress made on the indicators and monitoring systems that will be developed over time. "

Foreword

Ending poverty and addressing climate change are the two defining issues of our time. Both are essential to achieving sustainable global development. But they cannot be considered in isolation.
This report brings together these two overarching objectives and explores how they can be more easily achieved if considered together. It demonstrates the urgency of efforts to reduce poverty and the vulnerability of poor people in the face of climate change. It also provides guidance on how to ensure that climate change policies contribute to poverty reduction and poverty reduction policies contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building.
Our studies show that without action, climate change would likely spark higher agricultural prices and could threaten food security in poorer regions such as SubSaharan Africa and South Asia. And in most countries where we have data, poor urban households are more exposed to floods than the average urban population.
Climate change also will magnify many threats to health, as poor people are more susceptible to climate-related diseases such as malaria and diarrhea. As the report points out, poverty reduction is not a one-way street. Many people exit or fall back into poverty

each year. The poor live in uncertainty, just one natural disaster away from losing everything they have.
We need good, climate-informed development to reduce the impacts of climate change on the poor. This means, in part, providing poor people with social safety nets and universal health care. These efforts will need to be coupled with targeted climate resilience measures, such as the introduction of heatresistant crops and disaster preparedness systems.
The report shows that without this type of development, climate change could force more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030. But with rapid, inclusive development that is adapted to changing climate conditions, most of these impacts can be prevented.
Over the longer term, we will face the limits of what good development and risk management can achieve. Only immediate emissions-reduction policies can limit the long-term impacts of climate change on the poor. This report shows that these policies need not burden, and can actually benefit, the poor, through the use of proven mechanisms such as social safety nets to mitigate the impact of higher energy prices. The international community must also support poor
countries that cannot provide such protection.
The report combines the findings from household surveys in 92 countries that describe demographic structures and income sources with the most recent modeling results on the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and food prices; natural hazards such as heat waves, floods, and droughts; and climate-sensitive diseases and other health consequences.
Based on these findings and results, the report gives a renewed urgency to the objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 while tackling climate change. Development and poverty alleviation reduce people's vulnerability to the effects of a changing climate.

And ending extreme poverty will be more achievable now--with limited climate change impacts--than later, when impacts are likely to be larger.
The report shows us that the best way forward is to design and implement solutions to end extreme poverty and stabilize climate change as an integrated strategy. Such concerted action, implemented quickly and inclusively, can help ensure that millions of people are not pushed back into poverty by the multifaceted impacts of climate change.


Introduction
Climate change threatens the objective of sustainably eradicating poverty. Poor people and poor countries are exposed and vulnerable to all types of climate-related shocks-- natural disasters that destroy assets and livelihoods; waterborne diseases and pests that become more prevalent during heat waves, floods, or droughts; crop failure from reduced rainfall; and spikes in food prices that follow extreme weather events. Climate-related shocks also affect those who are not poor but remain vulnerable and can drag them into poverty--for example, when a flood destroys a micro-enterprise, a drought decimates a herd, or contaminated water makes a child sick. Such events can erase decades of hard work and asset accumulation and leave people with irreversible health consequences. Changes in climate conditions caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere can worsen these shocks and slow down poverty reduction.
Ending poverty will not be possible if climate change and its effects on poor people are not accounted for and managed in development and poverty-reduction policies. But neither can the climate be stabilized without

acknowledging that ending poverty is an utmost priority. The goal of maintaining climate change below a 2°C increase in global temperature above preindustrial levels--the very goal the international community has committed to--will require deep structural changes in the world economy. These changes will affect the conditions under which poor people succeed or fail to escape poverty. Emissions-reduction policies can increase energy and food prices, which represent a large share of poor people's expenditures. But these same policies can be designed to protect, and even benefit, poor people--for instance, by using fiscal resources from environmental taxes to improve social protection.
Ending poverty and stabilizing climate change will be two unprecedented global achievements and two major steps toward sustainable development--that is, development that balances the economic, social, and environmental considerations. But these two objectives cannot be considered in isolation: they need to be jointly tackled through an integrated strategy.
This report brings together these two objectives--ending poverty and stabilizing climate change--and explores how they can more easily be achieved if considered together. It examines the potential impact of climate

change and climate policies on poverty reduction. It also provides guidance on how to create a ""win-win"" situation so that climate change policies contribute to poverty reduction and poverty-reduction policies contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building.
The key finding of the report is that climate change represents a significant obstacle to the sustained eradication of poverty, but future impacts on poverty are determined by policy choices: rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most short-term impacts whereas immediate propoor, emissions-reduction policies can drastically limit long-term ones:
· Climate-related shocks and stresses, already a major obstacle to poverty reduction, will worsen with climate change. Climate is involved in most of the shocks that keep or bring households into poverty--notably, natural disasters (such as floods that cause asset loss and disability); health shocks (such as malaria that results in health expenditures and lost labor income); and crop losses and food price shocks (due to drought or crop disease). Poor people are disproportionately affected--not only because they are often more exposed and invariably more vulnerable to climate-related shocks but also because they have fewer resources and receive less support from family, community, the financial system, and even social safety nets to prevent, cope, and adapt. Climate change will worsen these shocks and stresses, contributing to a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction, thereby making it even harder to eradicate poverty in a sustainable manner.
· In the short run, rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most (but not all) consequences of climate change on poverty. Absent such good development, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030.

Between now and 2030, climate policies can do little to alter the amount of global warming that will take place. The only option, therefore, is to reduce vulnerability through both targeted adaptation investments and improved socioeconomic conditions (higher incomes and lower poverty and inequality).
Although development and adaptation cannot prevent all negative impacts from climate change, by 2030 they can prevent or offset most of its effects on poverty. But development must be rapid and inclusive to reduce poverty and provide poor people with social safety nets and universal health coverage. It also needs to be climate informed--meaning that investments and development patterns do not create new vulnerabilities and account for what we know about future climate conditions. And it needs to be accompanied by targeted adaptation (like upgrades in flood defenses or more heat-tolerant crops). · Immediate mitigation is required to remove the long-term threat that climate change creates for poverty eradication. Mitigation need not threaten short-term progress on poverty reduction provided policies are well designed and international support is available.
Our ability to manage increasing climate change impacts is limited. To keep long-term impacts on poverty in check, global temperatures need to be stabilized at a safe level--which implies that net global carbon emissions be brought down to zero before the end of the century. Such an ambitious goal requires that all governments act now to implement emissions-reduction policies. These policies will unambiguously benefit poor people over the long term, thanks to reduced climate change impacts, and they can be designed not to slow down poverty reduction over the short term.
All countries should pursue options that provide local and immediate benefits (like less pollution, better health, improved energy access and efficiency, reduced energy expenditures, and higher

agricultural productivity). Governments can protect the poor from the consequences of those mitigation policies that could impose net costs and create trade-offs--notably by strengthening social protection and cash transfers or reducing taxes, possibly using revenues from energy or carbon taxes or fossil fuel subsidy removal. In poor countries where domestic resources are insufficient to protect poor people, support from the international community is essential. This is particularly true for investments with high upfront costs that are critical to prevent lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (such as for urban transport, energy infrastructure, or deforestation).

Climate change is a threat to
poverty eradication
Poverty reduction is not a one-way transition out of poverty: many people exit or fall back into poverty every year. For instance, over a 25-year period, every year an average of 14 percent of households in 36 communities in Andhra Pradesh, India, escaped poverty and 12 percent of nonpoor households became poor--resulting in a net 2 percent annual decrease in poverty (figure O.1). The fact that, in practice, the net flow out of poverty is much smaller than the gross flows in and out of poverty means that a relatively small change in the gross flows in and out of poverty can significantly affect net flows and overall poverty dynamics. In the India example, if the flow into poverty increased from 12 to 13 percent per year or the flow out of poverty slowed from 14 to 13 percent per year, the pace of poverty reduction would be reduced by half.
Today, climate conditions or climate events are already involved in many cases where households fall into poverty. They include price shocks that can be linked to lower agricultural production (as occurred after the Russian droughts in 2010); natural disasters that destroy poor people's assets and affect health and education; and health shocks (such

as death and illness) that are influenced by climate and environmental conditions (like higher rainfall and more malaria outbreaks, or higher temperatures and more frequent diarrhea). In addition, climate risks affect the behavior of people, who may reduce investments and asset accumulation because of the possibility of losses and select lower-risk but lower-return activities--a rational strategy to avoid catastrophic outcomes, but one that can keep them in poverty.
The key question then is: How much will climate change influence the flows in and out of poverty and affect poverty over time? This report reviews the evidence and provides new quantification on the issue. It does this by examining the impact of climate change on three interacting channels that are already affecting the ability of the poor to escape poverty--agricultural and ecosystem impacts, natural disasters, and health shocks--and then deriving policy implications. Here we should note that climate change will have other impacts (for example on tourism or energy prices) that are not reviewed and assessed in this report, and a comprehensive estimate of all climate change impacts remains out of reach. However, even a subset of all possible impacts reveals worrying patterns on how changes in climate conditions would threaten the objective of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.



We find that climate change already worsens--and will further exacerbate-- climate-sensitive shocks and negative trends in the three sectors that we consider, consistent with recent reports from the World Bank (2014a) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014; Olsson et al. 2014). We also show that there will be an impact on poverty and inequality because poor people (i) are more often affected by these negative shocks or trends (they are more exposed); (ii) lose more when affected, relative to their income or wealth (they are more vulnerable); and (iii) receive less support from family, friends, and community, and have less access to financial tools or social safety nets to help prevent, prepare for, and manage impacts.
Poor people are more vulnerable to spikes in food prices and more dependent on agricultural and ecosystem-related income
Impacts on agricultural production and prices--triggered by either gradual changes in long-term climate trends or more frequent and severe natural disasters--will affect poor

people through food production impacts, higher consumption prices, and changes in rural incomes.
Lower crop yields and higher food prices. Modeling studies suggest that climate change could result in global crop yield losses as large as 5 percent in 2030 and 30 percent in 2080, even accounting for adaptive behaviors such as changed agricultural practices and crops, more irrigation, and innovation in higher yield crops (Biewald et al., forthcoming; Havlík et al., forthcoming). Over the short term, climate change will also create some benefits, but mostly in cold and relatively rich countries, while poorer regions will be the most negatively affected. The expected yield losses are likely to translate into higher agricultural prices; and climate change will make it more difficult, even with more trade, to ensure food security in regions like SubSaharan Africa and South Asia. In a world with rapid population growth, slow economic growth, and high GHG emissions (that is, a scenario in which global temperatures increase by approximately 4oC by 2100), food availability in these regions could plateau at levels far below current levels in developed countries (figure O.2).

But these estimates come with a high level of uncertainty. They vary depending on the type of climate, crop, and economic model applied, as well as on assumptions about CO2 fertilization (its presence should mean higher crop yields)--hence the -30 percent to +45 p ercent range in likely food price changes in 2050 that is reported by the IPCC (Porter et al. 2014). And they do not include local pollution and ozone, pests and crop diseases, food losses along the supply chain, or natural disasters that could result in temporary, but very severe, food price shocks.
In addition, emissions-reduction efforts could affect food prices and availability. The IPCC concludes that large-scale, land-based mitigation at the global scale, especially bioenergy expansion, can reduce the availability of land for food production, with implications for food security. In fact, new modeling simulations show that mitigation policies that do not consider food security could have price impacts that are larger than those of climate change (Havlík et al., forthcoming). However, more carefully designed mitigation policies could lead to price impacts that are smaller than those caused by unmitigated climate change (Lotze-Campen et al. 2014).
Changes in consumption and incomes. Losses in the agricultural sector and spikes in food prices can push vulnerable consumers into poverty--take, for example, the 2008 food price spike that caused about 100 m illion people to fall into poverty, or the 2010­11 episode that increased poverty by 44 million. Part of the problem is that poor people spend a larger share of their budget on food than the rest of the population, with nonagricultural rural households and urban residents the most vulnerable (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012).
In addition, farmers would directly suffer from production shocks that could reduce income and consumption. Data from Uganda between 2005 and 2011 suggest that a 10 p ercent reduction in water As for the rural poor, the situation could be mixed. If production shocks are accompanied by price rises, agricultural workers and farmers may benefit from higher wages and earnings (Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias 2014). So the net effect on income depends on how food prices react to reduced global production and how demand and diets can adjust over the short term and the long term. It also depends on the balance between local changes (which affect farmers' production) and global changes (which affect global food prices). And it depends on institutions-- especially labor markets--that determine how changes in revenues from agriculture are distributed between workers, landowners, and traders.
However, even if the net impact on income is positive, it is unlikely to offset the negative impacts of higher consumption prices on overall poverty. One study of 15 developing countries in various regions finds that climate-induced price rises increase extreme poverty by 1.8 percentage points (Hertel, Burke, and Lobell 2010). It also finds that, in parts of Africa and Asia, climate-related price adjustments could increase poverty rates for nonagricultural households by 20­50 percent. Similarly, another study shows that a once-in30-year climate extreme could double the number of poor urban laborers in the most vulnerable countries, including in Malawi, Mexico, and Zambia (Ahmed, Diffenbaugh, and Hertel 2009). Our own simulations reach similar results (see below).
Another complicating factor is that climate change--especially when combined with local stressors such as pollution and overuse-- threatens ecosystems, which provide subsistence production and safety nets for many people in rural areas. Poor smallholder communities across (sub)tropical landscapes depend on the extractive use of ecosystems for up to 30 percent of their income and often rely on ecosystem resources to keep themselves above the poverty threshold (figure O.4). Even though a precise quantification remains out of reach, a growing number of studies document how increasing climate stress threatens the livelihoods of poor people in a variety of rural contexts and forces them to pursue new livelihood strategies. Over the long term, climate change will even make some ecosystems (such as small island states or low-lying coastal areas) completely uninhabitable, forcing inhabitants to move.


Natural hazards, to which poor people are often more exposed and almost always more vulnerable, will become more intense and frequent in many regions
We are already experiencing an increase in natural hazards. About 75 percent of the moderate hot extremes over land and 18 percent of moderate precipitation extremes are attributable to global warming (Fischer and Knutti 2015). Even though some positive impacts are expected--such as fewer cold spells--the frequency and intensity of many hazards are expected to increase in most places:
· Heat waves that are considered exceptional today will become common. In Europe, the summer of the 2003 heat wave, which led to more than 70,000 deaths, will be an ""average"" summer at the end of this century under a high- emissions scenario (a scenario in which the global mean temperature has increased by about 4°C by 2100).
· The number of drought days could increase by more than 20 percent in most of the world by 2080, and the number of people exposed to droughts could increase by 9­17 percent in 2030 and 50­90 percent in 2080.
· The number of people exposed to river floods could increase by 4­15 percent in 2030 and 12­29 percent in 2080 (Winsemius et al., forthcoming), and coastal flood risks can increase rapidly with sea level rise (Hallegatte et al. 2013).
Will poor people bear the brunt of these climatic changes? Poor and nonpoor people settle in risky areas for many reasons. Sometimes, they lack information about the level of risk, or they do not account for this information in their decisions (World Bank 2013, chapter 2). But at-risk areas are often attractive in spite of the risk because they offer economic opportunities, public services or direct amenities, and higher productivity and incomes. In some rural areas, proximity to water offers cheaper transport, and regular


floods increase agricultural productivity. People settle in risky areas to benefit from opportunities--such as coastal areas with export-driven industries or cities with large labor markets and agglomeration spillovers. While these factors apply to rich and poor alike, local land and housing markets (or the availability of land) often push poorer people to settle in riskier, but more affordable, areas.
To shed more light on this issue, we investigated poverty-specific exposure to flood, droughts, and extreme temperatures within 52 countries to obtain a first global estimate of the difference in exposure for poor and nonpoor people.
Our results show that for drought, most of the analyzed population (85 percent) lives in countries where poor people are more exposed to droughts than the average (Winsemius et al., forthcoming). Poor people are also more exposed to higher temperatures: 37 out of 52 countries (56 percent of the population) exhibit an overexposure of poor people, with this bias stronger in hotter countries where high temperatures are more likely to be detrimental (figure O.5). As for river floods, the results are mixed: poor people are more exposed than the average in half of the countries analyzed (60 percent of the population). In Africa, countries in the southwest exhibit a strong overexposure of poor people, as do those with large rivers in west Africa (like Benin, Cameroon, and Nigeria). Focusing on urban households, we find that in most countries (73 percent of the population), poor households are more exposed to floods than the average (map O.1). This might be because land scarcity is more acute in urban areas (than in rural areas), creating a stronger incentive for the poor to settle in risky areas due to lower prices. This higher exposure to flood risk for poor urban dwellers is also found using higher-resolution data on household location and flood hazards in Mumbai, India.
Given that the dynamics of disasters and poverty occur at a fine scale, studies of exposure at the national scale may miss important mechanisms and small-scale differences, from one city block to the next. An alternative way to examine whether poor people are more by the dependence on ecosystems and the large fraction of their budget dedicated to food.
As a result of these differences in exposure and vulnerability, natural disasters increase inequality and may contribute to a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction. It is thus not surprising that natural disasters are found to worsen poverty. For instance, between 2000 and 2005, floods and droughts increased poverty levels in affected Mexican municipalities by 1.5 to 3.7 percent (Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. 2013). After Ethiopia's 1984­85 famine, it took a decade on average for asset-poor households to bring livestock holdings back to prefamine levels (Dercon 2004).

As for assets and income, nonpoor people lose a larger amount in absolute terms because they have more assets and higher incomes than the poor. But in relative terms, poor people always lose more than the nonpoor, according to the five surveys that report the magnitude of natural disaster losses, distinguishing by income classes (figure O.6, panel b). And it is these relative losses, rather than absolute ones, that matter most for livelihoods and welfare.
Poor people are losing relatively more to disasters for two main reasons. First, they often do not save at financial institutions, and they hold most of their wealth in vulnerable forms, such as housing for urban dwellers and livestock for rural households. Second, the quality of their assets--and the resistance of those assets to natural hazards--is often lower than average: typical houses found in a slum can be completely destroyed in a common flood whereas modern houses or multifamily buildings are much more resistant. And poor people's overall vulnerability is exacerbated

Poor people are strongly affected by diseases and health issues that climate change is likely to magnify
Climate change will magnify some threats to health, especially for poor and vulnerable people--such as children. The exact impacts are still highly uncertain in what is still an emerging research field. Past progress on medical treatment offers hope that some of these issues could be solved over the long term thanks to new drugs and better health infrastructure. But short-term impacts could still be significant.
Health shocks are important for poverty dynamics and the impact of climate change for three main reasons. First, the main diseases that affect poor people are diseases that are expected to expand with climate change (such as malaria and diarrhea). Second, health expenditures are regressive, with poor households largely uninsured--such outlays push an estimated 100 million people per year into poverty--and the loss of income for the sick or the caregiver can have a large impact on family prospects (WHO 2013). Third, children are most vulnerable to these shocks and can suffer from irreversible impacts that affect their lifetime earnings and lead to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.

Malaria. Even small temperature increases could significantly affect the transmission of malaria. At the global level, warming of 2°C or 3°C could increase the number of people at risk for malaria by up to 5 percent, or more than 150 million people. In Africa, malaria could increase by 5­7 percent among populations at risk in higher altitudes, leading to a potential increase in the number of cases of up to 28 percent (Small, Goetz, and Hay 2003). Further, climate change is projected to intensify malaria along the current edges of its distribution, where malaria control programs are often nonexistent and people have no naturally acquired immunity against the disease.
Diarrhea. Climate impacts could increase the burden of diarrhea by up to 10 percent by 2030 in some regions (WHO 2003). Indeed, higher temperatures favor the development of pathogens, and water scarcity affects water quality and the hygiene habits that can prevent diarrhea. An estimated 48,000 additional deaths among children under the age of 15 resulting from diarrheal illness are projected by 2030 (Hales et al. 2014). And climate change could contribute to outbreaks of other waterborne diseases such as cholera and schistosomiasis.
Stunting. In part because of its impacts on agriculture (figure O.2), climate change will increase undernutrition and could sharply increase severe stunting among children. By 2030, an additional 7.5 million children may be stunted (Hales et al. 2014). Climate change could even lead to an absolute increase in the number of stunted children in some parts of Africa, with the negative effect of climate change outweighing the positive effect of economic growth (Lloyd, Kovats, and Chalabi 2011). And recent evidence suggests that the nutritional quality of food (for example, its content in terms of micronutrients such as iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate, and zinc) could also be affected by climate change, even though little is known about potential impacts (Myers et al. 2014).
Even less is known about the combined effects of multiple health stressors. For instance, it is well known that undernourished children are more vulnerable to malaria

and other vectorborne or waterborne diseases, but these interactions have not yet been investigated in the context of climate change. Also impossible to quantify is the impact on mental disorders and stress due to increased risk, disasters, or indirect impacts through physical health, household dynamics, or community well-being. And changes in climate and environmental conditions will interact with local air pollution and allergen distribution, exacerbating respiratory diseases. One estimate is that climate change could cause annually an additional 100,000 premature deaths associated with exposure to small particulate matter and 6,300 premature deaths associated with ozone exposure (Fang et al. 2013).
Another concern is that high temperatures will reduce labor productivity of those who are poorer and often work outside or without air conditioning (figure O.7). The impact on labor productivity could be large and reduce income by several percentage points. Moreover, this effect is not accounted for in any of the studies we reviewed on estimates of agricultural production, although it could magnify food security issues. In addition, new research suggests that extreme temperature stress in either direction--hot or cold-- is suboptimal for economic activity, even when considering only nonfarm activities. These results imply that the temperature-related loss in performance observed in
laboratories and at the individual level may be observable at the macroeconomic level, and that climate change could hurt overall income through this channel (Deryugina and Hsiang 2014; Heal and Park 2013; Park et al., forthcoming).
Poor people receive less support from friends and family and have more limited access to financial tools and social safety nets
Many policy instruments exist that could help poor people prevent, adapt to, and cope with climate shocks and changes (World Bank 2013), but poor people have only limited access to them (figure O.8). Take the case of financial inclusion-- meaning access to formal savings, borrowing, and insurance products (figure O.8, panel a). People may lack access to these formal financial tools for several reasons, including the cost of bank accounts, distance and time to access a financial agent, lack of documentation, or mistrust in banks. Some people also prefer to stay in the informal sector, or are not aware of the benefits of using financial tools for risk management (Allen et al. 2012).
Poor people also receive limited support from social safety nets, ranging from cash transfers to work programs (figure O.8, panel b). In many countries, social programs cover less than half of the poorest quintile. In addition, even when poor households are covered by social protection schemes, amounts received are often too small to make a big difference and prevent negative coping strategies. In Bangladesh after the 1998 floods, poor affected households had to borrow an amount equal to six to eight times the level of government transfers (del Ninno, Dorosh, and Smith 2003).
Then, too, migration and remittances play a key role in managing shocks--but migration requires resources and assets that the poorest lack, and data show that remittances tend to benefit nonpoor people more than poor people (figure O.8, panel c). As a result, poor people are disproportionally affected by

climate change and natural shocks, not only because they are more exposed and vulnerable to them but also because they receive less support.
By 2030, rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can prevent most (but not all) climate change impacts on poverty
Just how large might these impacts be on poverty by 2030 and how much can development help? We know that between now and then, climate policies will have minimal impacts on warming, given the long lag between the introduction of mitigation policies, their impact on emissions, and the effect of emissions reductions on the climate system (IPCC 2014). This means that, by 2030, the only way to reduce climate change impacts will be by lowering socioeconomic vulnerability to these impacts--which will require climate-informed development and specific actions to adapt to climate change.
The magnitude of future climate change impacts on poverty depends on today's choices
In this report, we try to get a sense of the magnitude of future climate change impacts--and how this magnitude depends on today's choices--by creating two scenarios for what the future of poverty could be by 2030 in the absence of climate change (figure O.9). The first one, ""Prosperity,"" assumes that the World Bank's goals of extreme poverty eradication and shared prosperity are met by 2030 (in particular, less than 3 percent of the world population remains in extreme poverty), and that access to basic services is quasi-universal. The second scenario, ""Poverty,"" is much more pessimistic in terms of poverty reduction and inequalities (for instance, 11 percent of the world population remains in extreme poverty).

We then introduce into each of these scenarios estimates of climate change impacts on food price and production, natural disasters, and health and labor productivity, based on the reviews and analyses presented in the report. But we do so with two climate change impact scenarios--a low-impact and a highimpact scenario--given that the physical and biological impacts will be highly uncertain, dependent on (i) how ecosystems adapt and physical systems (like glaciers and coastal zones) respond and (ii) how sectors spontaneously adapt (like adopting new agricultural practices or improved hygiene habits).
We do not attribute probabilities or likelihoods to the development and climate impact scenarios because we are not interested in forecasting the future of poverty (it is probably impossible). What interests us is the contrast across scenarios rather than the absolute numbers. That is why we focus on how the impacts of climate change on poverty would differ if development is rapid and inclusive (""Prosperity"") as opposed to slow and noninclusive (""Poverty"").
The bottom line is that, even though our analysis looks only at the short term with limited changes in climate conditions, it still finds that climate change could have a large effect on extreme poverty: by 2030, between 3 and 16 million people in the prosperity scenario and between 35 and 122 million people in the poverty scenario would be in poverty because of climate change.
That said, these estimates are likely an underestimate for several reasons. First, we follow a bottom-up approach and sum the sector-level impacts, assuming they do not interact. Second, we consider only a subset of impacts, even within the three sectors we focus on. For instance, we do not include losses in ecosystem services and reduced nutritional quality of food; we consider only consumption poverty, disregarding outcomes like the non-monetary effects of disease; and we do not include secondary impacts of disasters (like the potential effect on migrants and refugees). Third, we cannot assess the poverty impact everywhere. Our scenarios are developed based on a household

database that represents only 83 percent of the developing world's population. Some high vulnerability countries (such as small islands) could not be included because of data limitations, in spite of the large effects that climate change could have on their poverty rate.
Although climate change has a significant impact on poverty up to 2030--working primarily through the agricultural channel (box O.1)--it remains a secondary driver, as evidenced by the nearly 800 million person difference between the two socioeconomic scenarios in the absence of climate change (table O.1). This does not mean that climate change impacts are secondary at the local scale: in some particularly vulnerable places

(like small islands or in locations affected by large disasters), the local impact could be massive.
Note that the large range of estimates in our results may incorrectly suggest that we cannot say anything about the future impact of climate change on poverty. The main reason for this wide range is not scientific uncertainty on climate change and its impacts. I n s t e a d , p o l i c y c h o i c e s d o m i n a t e -- particularly those concerning development patterns and poverty-reduction policies between now and 2030. While emissions-reduction policies cannot do much regarding the climate change that will happen between now and 2030 (because that is mostly the result of past emissions), development

choices can affect what the impact of that climate change will be.
Also note that the range of possible impacts is even larger than the one represented by our four scenarios because there is an infinite number of possible socioeconomic pathways by 2030, even without climate change. To assess the robustness of our results, we create 60 alternative prosperity and 60 alternative poverty scenarios. We find that the range of possible impacts on poverty remains limited in the prosperity scenario: development not only reduces the impacts but also protects us from the uncertainty. In the poverty scenario, on the other hand, the range of possible outcomes is extremely large: the worst-case estimate increases up to 165 million, and some scenarios show a decrease in global poverty numbers--these are scenarios where climate change impacts remain moderate (lowimpact) and where farmers benefit the most from higher agricultural prices.
The lower vulnerability of the developing world to climate change in the prosperity scenario comes from several channels. First, people are wealthier and fewer households live with a daily income close to the poverty line. Wealthier individuals are less exposed to health shocks such as stunting and diarrhea, and are less likely to fall back into poverty when hit by a shock. And with fewer farmers, the population is less vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on yields. Second, the global population is smaller in the

prosperity scenario in 2030, by 2 percent globally and by up to 20 percent in some African countries due to more migration. A smaller population mitigates the impact of climate change on food prices. In addition, the prosperity scenario assumes more technology transfers to developing countries, which further reduces the agricultural loss due to climate change. In the prosperity scenario, a more balanced economy and better governance also mean that farmers capture a larger share of the income benefits from higher food prices.
At the country and regional level, the hotspots are Sub-Saharan Africa and--to a lesser extent--India and the rest of South Asia (map O.2). Almost all countries are less vulnerable to climate change in the prosperity scenario, often dramatically: in India, the high-impact climate change scenario brings 2 million people into poverty in the prosperity scenario, compared to almost 50 million in the poverty scenario. One exception is the Democratic Republic of Congo, where climate change is found to bring more people into poverty in the prosperity scenario. This occurs because, in the poverty scenario without climate change, the poverty rate is extremely high (70 percent): climate change draws fewer people into poverty than in the prosperity scenario only because so many people are already in poverty.
Such a result warns us against using a poverty headcount as the unique indicator of the
impact of climate change on poverty. Because it does not measure poverty depth, it does not capture the impact on people who are already poor. For instance, in a high-impact climate scenario, climate change reduces the income of the bottom 40 percent in 2030 by more than 4 percent in most of the countries in both the prosperity and poverty scenarios. And, in most Sub-Saharan African countries and Pakistan, climate change reduces the income of the bottom 40 percent by more than 8 percent.
Climate-informed development needs to be complemented with targeted adaptation interventions and a more robust safety net system
Rapid and inclusive development can prevent most of the impact of climate change on poverty, but only if new investments and developments are climate informed--that is, designed to perform well under changing climate conditions so that they do not create new vulnerabilities to climate impacts. For example, new water and sanitation infrastructure can make a big difference for diarrhea, but only if it can absorb the more extreme rainfall episodes that are expected in many regions. Similarly, new settlements in safe areas will reduce the long-term vulnerability only if the selected areas remain safe in spite of sea level rise and accelerated erosion.
However, even a rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development will not cancel out the need for targeted actions that are aimed at lowering people's vulnerability to climate change impacts. Although some of them are pure climate change adaptation measures (like adapting building norms to new environmental conditions), others (like increasing financial inclusion) can be seen as ""good development"" and would make sense even in the absence of climate change.
Our report highlights potential options in the three sectors that we focus on (agriculture and ecosystems, natural disasters, and health) and emphasizes the potential of social protection and financial tools to boost the resilience of households and economies to all sorts of

shocks, including those magnified by climate change (table O.2). Of course, each country can identify its own priorities, based on the impacts of climate change that are expected on its territory, but also on synergies and convergence with other policy priorities. For instance, where urban planning is a policy priority, mainstreaming natural hazards and climate change into its design is a low-hanging fruit waiting to be plucked.
Climate-smart agriculture and protected ecosystems. Climate-smart agricultural practices can increase productivity and resilience (Cervigni and Morris 2015). More productive and more resilient practices, however, require a major shift in the way land, water, soil nutrients, and genetic resources are managed to ensure that these resources are used more efficiently (FAO 2013). Crop improvement, smarter use of inputs, approaches to strengthen crop resistance to pests and diseases, and reduction of post-harvest losses can contribute to the sustainable intensification of agriculture--thereby leading to greater food production (Beddington 2010; Tilman et al. 2011).
For this to happen, innovation is needed to keep increasing yields, and the new techniques that result from innovation must actually be broadly adopted, including by poor farmers. These two conditions are challenging. First, yield increases have plateaued in recent years, even exhibiting abrupt decreases in some regions (Grassini, Eskridge, and Cassman 2013). The low and declining levels of investment in agricultural research and development in the developing world are a major constraint to realize further yield gains in poor countries (Pardey, Alston, and Chan-Kang 2013). Second, disseminating improved technologies and making them accessible to poor farmers is difficult, and even promising innovations sometimes have low or no uptake. High implementation costs, cultural barriers, and lack of access to information and education need to be overcome. Agricultural extension services can help farmers make better use of new technologies. In Uganda, extension visits increased household agricultural income by around 16 percent when new crop

varieties were available (Hill and MejiaMantilla 2015).
Poor people can become more resilient to shocks in agriculture thanks to trade and food reserves that can overcome local shortages in times of need, better access of poor farmers to markets, and improved technologies and climate-smart production techniques. Access to functioning markets, however, depends on better infrastructure and better institutions. In Ethiopia, the incidence of poverty decreased by 6.7 percent following farmers' access to all-weather roads (Dercon et al. 2009). In Burkina Faso, maize price volatility is found to be greatest in remote markets (Ndiaye, Maitre d'Hôtel, and Le Cotty 2015). Investments in transport infrastructure improve market integration, reduce price uncertainty for farmers, and improve food security.
For ecosystem-based income, the main option is to reduce the nonclimate stresses on ecosystems to make them better able to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Conservation and ecosystem-based strategies are critical for making ecosystems more resilient and for protecting the resources on which many poor people in rural areas depend. Healthy ecosystems are generally quite resilient, so protecting them and restoring degraded lands can increase their ability to withstand climate-related disturbances. Integrating trees in agricultural systems can also reduce vulnerability to drought and increase the store of carbon (figure O.10).
Land use regulations and better and more infrastructure for natural hazards. Land use regulations can ensure that new development occurs in places that are safe, or easy and cheap to protect using hard or soft infrastructure. But effective implementation of such regulations remains challenging. First, it requires appropriate data on risk and hazard, which remains limited in low-income environments despite recent progress (including the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery's [GFDRR] Open Data for Resilience Initiative that makes risk data available for governments and the p ublic).
Second, strong institutions are needed to ensure that land use plans are actually enforced, and even the highest-capacity countries struggle to reduce flood exposure. Third, one needs to take into account the reasons why people decide to live in risky places, namely a trade-off between safety and access to jobs and services (Hallegatte 2012a). In a new survey, poor households in Mumbai say they would relocate to a safer place but only if they had access to cheap transport, health services, schools, and social networks (Patankar, forthcoming). Thus, land use planning can realistically function only if accompanied by investments in transport and other infrastructure to make it possible for people to settle in safe places while maintaining access to the same (or comparable) jobs and services.
Poor people lack the type of protective infrastructure that is common in richer countries. For instance, poor households are often exposed to recurrent floods due to the lack, or poor maintenance, of infrastructure (especially drainage systems)--even if these events do not attract media and policy maker attention, they can represent a large burden on poor people. Solving these problems requires investing more and investing better. Around $1 trillion per year would be


needed in developing countries to close the infrastructure gap, with about $100 billion for Africa alone. Closing this gap is difficult, but it would go a long way toward reducing the vulnerability of poor people. Recommendations typically include leveraging private resources to make the most of available capital, which involves well-known steps like improving the investment climate, developing local capital markets, and providing a pipeline of ""bankable"" projects (Fay et al. 2015).
But infrastructure investments will reduce the long-term vulnerability of the population and contribute to long-term poverty reduction only if they serve poor people. In particular, investing where it is most cost-efficient would risk concentrating resources on wealthier populations at the expense of poor communities (Tschakert, forthcoming). New infrastructure also needs to be designed to remain efficient in spite of changes in climate and environmental conditions. Innovative methods for managing the uncertain risks of climate change and multiple (and sometimes conflicting) policy objectives can be applied to meet these challenges (Kalra et al. 2014). Several World Bank pilot projects using these methods have been completed or are under way, including on water supply in Lima, flood risk management in Ho Chi Minh City and Colombo, hydropower investment in Nepal, and adaptation of road networks in Peru and across Africa.
As discussed earlier, poor people lose a larger fraction of their assets and income because their dwelling is often their main asset and because they live in buildings with low resistance to natural hazards. In addition to financial inclusion--which could help people save in less vulnerable ways--improving tenure security could incentivize investment in housing, including in risk reduction, to make them more resistant. In Peru, the issuance of property titles to over 1.2 million urban dwellers encouraged households to invest more in their homes, thereby reducing their vulnerability (Field 2007).
Early warning systems--combined with observation systems and evacuation

preparedness--can save many lives at a low cost. When Cyclone Phailin made landfall near Gopalpur, India, in 2013, it killed fewer than 100 people. While still a significant loss, it is much smaller than the 10,000 deaths that a similar storm caused in 1999. More generally, early warning systems are very cost-effective investments, with each dollar invested yielding more than $4 in avoided losses (Hallegatte 2012b). However, over the past 15­20 years, the situation of many hydrometeorological services in developing countries has worsened (Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013). As a result, the ability to monitor local climate change and increases in natural risks has eroded, making developing countries less able to detect, anticipate, and adapt to climate change.
Better health infrastructure and universal health care. Poor people in low- and lowermiddle-income countries have limited access to health care, and face out-of-pocket expenditure exceeding 50 percent of health expenses--much higher than the less than 15 percent that is common in rich countries (figure O.11). But examples show that better health coverage is possible everywhere. In Colombia, thanks to a multilevel government scheme and cross-subsidization from contributory schemes, the poor are covered against primary care and catastrophic event costs--with coverage of the poorest quintile up to 47 percent in 1997 from only 3­8 p ercent in 1993. In Rwanda, the government invested in universal health coverage after the 1994 genocide, and today nearly 80 percent of its population is insured.
However, benefits from better access to care depend on the quality of care, and in most countries parallel efforts are required to develop and improve health infrastructure. Climate change makes this need even more important. Countries should have strong monitoring and surveillance systems able to detect new health issues that will periodically arise in response to changing climate conditions. They also need research and development on the diseases that affect poor people and that are expected to increase with climate change.
Social safety nets and financial tools. A growing body of evidence shows that insurance and social safety nets are efficient tools to support poor people when they are affected by natural disasters or environmental and economic shocks. In Mexico, beneficiaries of Prospera, the national cash transfer program (previously known as Oportunitades or Progresa), are less likely to respond to shocks by withdrawing their children from the classroom (de Janvry et al. 2006; Fiszbein, Schady, and Ferreira 2009; Gertler 2004).
To ensure that the financial sector and social safety nets provide instruments relevant to climate change, governments need to design a holistic risk management and climate change strategy, giving a voice to poor people and making their protection a priority. Such a strategy will necessarily include a range of instruments, targeted to specific disasters or social groups (figure O.12).
Basic social protection and revenue diversification can help households at all income levels cope with small and frequent shocks. But for larger shocks, additional tools are

needed. For relatively wealthier households, savings and market insurance can offer efficient protection for larger losses. But the poorest households have minimal savings, and high transaction costs make it difficult to offer them private insurance. Instead, the government needs to provide social safety


nets that are well targeted and can be scaled up rapidly after a shock.
A key challenge is to strike a balance between providing rapid support when needed and precisely targeting those most in need. Case studies in Ethiopia and Malawi suggest that the cost of a drought to households can increase from zero to about $50 per household if support is delayed by four months, and to about $1,300 if support is delayed by six to nine months (Clarke and Hill 2013). This rapid increase, which is due to irreversible impacts on children and distress sales of assets (especially livestock), helps explain why most postdisaster responses have multiple stages. Typically, initial support is delivered quickly--even at the expense of targeting and accuracy--and larger recovery and reconstruction efforts are provided later with more emphasis on appropriate targeting.
Experience shows that countries at all income levels can implement social safety nets to protect their population, even though the appropriate instruments depend on local capacity. Preexisting social protection programs with large and flexible social registries help provide prompt support to affected people so that they do not have to resort to costly coping strategies. For instance, by using the preexisting conditional cash transfer system (the 4Ps), the government of the Philippines was able to quickly release a total of P550.5 million (US$12.5 million) between November 2013 and February 2014 in emergency unconditional cash transfers to 4Ps beneficiaries affected by Typhoon Yolanda (Bowen, forthcoming). When droughts in Ethiopia caused food shortages and famine in 2011, the Productive Safety Net Program expanded its coverage from 6.5 million to 9.6 million people in two months and increased the duration of benefits from six to nine months per year (Johnson and Bowen, forthcoming). These safety nets remain affordable and reduce the need for costly humanitarian interventions.
However, adaptive social protection systems create an additional liability for governments, who may then need to turn to specific

instruments such as reserve funds, regional mechanisms, contingent finance or reinsurance products (like the World Bank's Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option, or Cat-DDOs), or even international aid if local capacities are exhausted (Ghesquiere and Mahul 2010). In response to Cyclone Pam in March 2015, the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), a regional mechanism, provided Vanuatu with a rapid $1.9 million payment that supported the immediate response.
Social protection schemes also need to maintain incentives to invest in long-term adaptation to economic and environmental changes. Poorly designed social safety nets can reduce the incentive for people to quickly adapt and change occupation or activity when the first effects of climate change appear (Chambwera et al. 2014). This problem is not new and specific to climate change: efforts are already under way to ensure that social protection is a facilitator of--and not an obstacle to--long-term change and adaptation, for instance by facilitating migration (Brown, Zelenska, and Mobarak 2013; Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014) or making benefits more portable if the recipient decides to move to capture better opportunities (World Bank 2015b).
Combining rapid, inclusive, and climateinformed development with targeted interventions and stronger safety nets would largely reduce the short-term threat from climate change--and, fortunately, developing countries have a window of opportunity to go in that direction before most of the climate change impacts materialize. In parallel, the international community can do much to support them. This includes offering resources for climate risk analysis and project preparation, and ensuring that financial instruments and resources are available for development and poverty reduction investments--especially when higher resilience implies higher upfront costs. The international community can also build resilience by strengthening international risk-sharing mechanisms and generalizing access to contingent finance in emergency situations.


Emissions-reduction policies are
required to remove the long-
term threat from climate change,
and need not threaten progress
on poverty reduction
In the absence of mitigation policies, risks for development and poverty eradication will grow over time and only emissions reduction can limit long-term risks (IPCC 2014). While this report proposes options to reduce climate risks, it also points to the limits of these options: land use planning faces difficult political economy obstacles, financial constraints make it tough to invest in protection infrastructure, and the provision of health care in rural areas remains challenging. And, although social safety nets and health insurance help households cope with shocks, they do not reduce the direct and immediate impact on well-being and assets and will become increasingly costly-- even unaffordable--if shocks become more frequent and intense (Carter and Janzen, forthcoming). There are clear limits to what adaptation can achieve, and these limits will be tested by climate change.
Moreover, some long-term risks could prove catastrophic--such as those related to the response of ice sheets and ecosystems-- and remain impossible to quantify in terms of consequences or probability. Uncertainty is not a reason to delay climate change mitigation action. On the contrary, the need for climate stabilization arises from both a risk-management approach that accounts for threats created by long-term impacts and the fact that GHG emissions lock us into irreversible warming. Indeed, these long-term risks largely explain why the international community has committed to the goal of stabilizing climate change.
Maintaining global warming below 2°C, or even below 3°C, will require bringing emissions down to zero by 2100, a goal recognized by the leaders of the major industrial countries at the 2015 summit of the G7. And there is a consensus that current development trends are incompatible with these

internationally agreed climate targets (IPCC 2014). Thus, policies are needed now to make development and climate change stabilization compatible: modern living standards will need to be supported in a more efficient and radically less carbon-intensive way, and residual emissions offset through natural carbon sinks like forests (Fay et al. 2015).
The first step is for all countries to enact comprehensive packages of emissions- reduction policies (IPCC 2014)--ranging from carbon pricing and innovation support to environmental performance standards, information labels, financing facilities, and land use and urban planning (Fay et al. 2015; NCE 2014; OECD 2015). Priority should go to implementing the policies and measures that are urgently needed to prevent irreversibility and lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (such as those regarding deforestation, energy infrastructure, or urban transport).
These policy packages must be designed in a way that does not threaten the objective of eradicating poverty by 2030. This can be done in three complementary ways: (i) building on no-regret options and cobenefits; (ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable populations against potential adverse consequences of emissions-reduction options; and (iii) in the poorest countries, using support from the international community to offset possible trade-offs between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation.
All countries should embrace the mitigation policies that generate short-term cobenefits that exceed costs--like lower air pollution and higher energy efficiency. Recent studies have found that, in all regions, the benefits for health and agricultural yields from less pollution alone could exceed the cost of mitigation, at least until 2030 (Shindell et al. 2012). For example, a pathway leading to lowering CO2 concentrations would avoid 0.5 million premature deaths annually in 2030, 1.3 million in 2050, and 2.2 million in 2100, compared to a scenario with only the progress that can be expected from the historically observed uptake of pollution-control technologies.
Many other cobenefits are likely to occur in various sectors (World Bank 2014b).


Better public transit would reduce congestion and traffic accidents, and greater energy efficiency would bode well for productivity. Yet many countries, facing strong financing constraints, tend to favor technologies with lower upfront capital costs, at the expense of higher operation costs--in effect, favoring less energy-efficient technology and reducing overall productivity (World Bank 2012).
Governments need to enact policies to actively promote the adoption of no-regret options that reduce GHG emissions and accelerate development. A recent World Bank report reviews market and government failures that hamper the adoption of these noregret options--such as incorrect pricing, split incentives, poor enforcement of existing regulations, lack of information, behavioral failures, and limits to the financing capacity of stakeholders--and offers solutions to overcome them (Fay et al. 2015). The international community can help developing countries by providing a combination of technical assistance and better access to green technologies (for instance to help them implement performance standards for vehicles, lighting, and appliances). It can also help them mobilize private capital to relax existing investment constraints and favor technologies with higher upfront costs but better efficiency, drawing on innovative financial instruments or the resources from bilateral and multilateral development banks.
In addition, all countries need to avoid negative impacts of mitigation policies on food security, since the resulting effects on global food prices could have a detrimental impact on the poor. Promisingly, many landbased mitigation options also provide an opportunity to strengthen the productivity of agriculture and ecosystems and to boost local incomes. They can be implemented through payments for ecosystem services, which can provide a source of income for the poor. An estimated 25­50 million low-income households could be benefitting from them by 2030 (Milder, Scherr, and Bracer 2010).
But to stay on a pathway compatible with the complete decarbonization of the economy before 2100, countries will have to do more

than implement win-win options, sometimes creating net costs and trade-offs. Fortunately, governments can protect the poorest, using specific instruments or their existing social protection systems, possibly strengthened by the resources raised by climate policies. For instance, climate policies need to ensure that they do not slow down the switch from traditional biomass to modern cooking fuels, for example by subsidizing efficient cookstoves. This matters greatly because traditional cooking fuels not only are unhealthy but also worsen gender imbalances and affect educational opportunities, given the time women and children often spend collecting wood and other traditional fuels (WHO 2006).
There are many options to make climate policies pro-poor--such as introducing a carbon or energy tax and recycling the revenues through a universal cash transfer that would benefit the poor. An analysis of 20 developing countries shows that for each $100 of additional energy tax collected and redistributed, the bottom quintile gains $13 while the richest quintile loses $23, and overall the bottom 60 percent would benefit from the measure (del Granado, Coady, and Gillingham 2012; Fay et al. 2015).
Similarly, we can estimate how the resources that could be raised by a carbon tax in one country (or an equivalent reform of energy subsidies) compare with current social assistance transfers. Based on current CO2 emissions and without any international transfer, a $30/tCO2 (tons of CO2) domestic carbon tax would raise resources amounting to more than 1.5 percent of national GDP in half of the 87 countries where data are available (figure O.13, panel a). And in 60 out of the 87 countries, a $30/tCO2 domestic carbon tax would provide the resources to more than double current levels of social assistance in the country (figure O.13, panel b). Even a low carbon tax at $10/tCO2 would make it possible to significantly scale up social assistance or other investments that benefit poor people (like connections to sanitation and improved drinking water or access to modern energy).
More generally, the impacts of climate mitigation policies on inequality can be corrected

using policies specifically designed to redistribute income in the economy--such as using income or consumption taxes to fund cash transfers or social safety net programs (Borenstein and Davis 2015; Gahvari and Mattos 2007; Lindert, Skoufias, and Shapiro 2006). A World Bank study based on household surveys reveals that countries with GDP per capita above $4,000 (in purchasing power parity) have sufficient internal resources to redistribute poverty away, and thus can protect poor people against the possible negative effects of climate mitigation (Ravallion 2010). This is important because around 70 percent of people in extreme poverty live in these countries that are able to protect them.
But in very poor countries, it may be difficult for economic, political, or institutional reasons to accomplish this. In particular, the same World Bank study shows that countries with a GDP per capita below $4,000 (in purchasing power parity) would find it nearly impossible to rely on internal resources for redistribution. In these countries, even if most of the cost of climate mitigation is paid for by the wealthier quintiles of the population,

climate mitigation could still worsen poverty, because the top quintiles are still in, or close to, poverty. In these cases, international support will be essential to offset potential tradeoffs between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation.
This is especially the case for investments that involve high immediate costs--and therefore large trade-offs with other investments-- but are urgently needed to prevent irreversibility and lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns. The typical example is urban transit. While transit-oriented development may require higher upfront costs than road-based low- density urbanization, there is now a unique window of opportunity to build efficient transit-oriented cities, because of high urbanization rates in many developing countries and the extended lifetime of urban forms and transit infrastructure.
In conclusion
Bringing together the short-run (up to 2030) and long-run views, this report emphasizes how climate change could set back poverty
eradication efforts--including the risk that unabated climate change creates for the internationally agreed objective of eradicating extreme poverty. In parallel, it demonstrates that the future is not set in stone. We have a window of opportunity to achieve our poverty objectives in spite of climate change by pursuing both (i) rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development, combined with targeted adaptation interventions, to cope with the short-term impacts of climate change and (ii) immediate pro-poor mitigation policies to limit long-term impacts and create an environment that allows for global prosperity and the sustainable eradication of poverty.
1 From Climate Change to Poverty and Back: A Framework

Main Messages

· Climate-sensitive events are already a critical obstacle for people trying to escape poverty and those who are vulnerable to falling back into poverty.
· There are three major channels through which climate-sensitive events already affect the a bility of poor people to escape poverty: (i) agricultural production, ecosystems, and food security; (ii) natural disasters; and (iii) health. All are likely to be significantly affected by climate change.

· The net impact of climate change on poverty and well-being will be mediated by socioeconomic trends (like demography, growth, and inequality) and non-climate change policies (like skills development and redistribution).

Introduction
Despite substantial progress in reducing poverty rates, around 700 million people still live in extreme poverty (World Bank 2015a).1 In addition, hundreds of millions hover close above the poverty line, vulnerable to shocks that could send them into poverty, or suffer from other dimensions of poverty-- such as exclusion, powerlessness, and poor health--even if their consumption is above the poverty threshold (Bourguignon and Chakravarty 2003; Ferreira and Lugo 2013).

At the same time, the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda--which builds on the 2015 Millennium Development Goals--has reaffirmed the goal of ending extreme poverty or, as framed by the World Bank, bringing the number of people living on less than $1.90 per day to under 3 percent by 2030. Moreover, the agreed goal is not simply to eliminate poverty by 2030, but to eliminate it for good and ensure gains are not reversed after 2030.
How does climate change fit into this picture? We know that climate change affects the

population, including the poorest, through changes in environmental conditions and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (O'Brien and Leichenko 2000; Olsson et al. 2014). While the magnitude of climate change is likely to be relatively limited between now and 2030, compared with what can be expected over the long term, its impacts may still be important in certain locations (like semi-arid areas where precipitation will decrease in response to climate change) or for certain people (like those already living close to subsistence levels). Moreover, anticipated warming by 2030 cannot be reduced much, as any action taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions takes several decades to significantly affect climate change.
As we approach the end of this century, in the absence of ambitious climate-mitigation policies, global warming may exceed 4°C, and impacts are likely to become ""severe, widespread and irreversible,"" threatening poverty reduction and development (IPCC 2014a; World Bank 2015b). But the good news is that we still have a window of opportunity to adopt and implement emissionsreduction policies that could slow down and stabilize long-term climate change, and in the process, usher in a more prosperous world.
One more wrinkle in this story is that the climate change­poverty link is actually twoway. Expected progress in poverty reduction and access to basic services has the potential to reduce vulnerability to climate change and reduce its impacts (Hallegatte, Przyluski, and Vogt-Schilb 2011; Wilbanks and Ebi 2013). But the future of poverty also matters for climate change. Development and economic growth, critical elements for reducing poverty, directly affect energy consumption and access to technologies--which, in turn, affect greenhouse gas emissions and the long-term pace and magnitude of climate change.
Against this backdrop--and the limited research done so far on this two-way relationship--this report sets out to explore the potential impact of climate change and climate policies on poverty reduction, and investigate whether climate change can represent a significant obstacle to the objective of

ending extreme poverty. It also provides guidance on how to design climate policies such that they contribute to poverty reduction as well as on how to design poverty-reduction policies such that they contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building. And it contributes to a series of reports that explore the complex relationship between development and climate change (box 1.1).
The report aims to answer the following questions:
· Will the changing climate be a threat to ending poverty, at what time horizon, and under which conditions? Would climate change make it impossible to end poverty only in the most pessimistic scenarios, or would it be a threat even in more moderate or optimistic cases? Will this impact be concentrated in highly vulnerable locations, or more broadly distributed globally? Is it a long-term trend, or is it also relevant over the shorter term?
· What emissions-reduction policies and adaptation actions can reduce this threat? In particular, how can we balance short-term actions (like reducing vulnerability to floods and droughts) with longterm goals such as stabilizing the climate? How should adaptation actions navigate across different options to reduce vulnerability--from poverty reduction and increased income to targeted adaptation policies and social protection? How can adaptation policies prevent lock-ins into activities and locations that will become increasingly unable to sustain rising standards of living?
· How should poverty concerns be factored into mitigation and adaptation policies? Are there trade-offs between mitigation and poverty goals, and if so how can these be managed? Can complementary policies cancel out potential negative effects on the poor? How can we design adaptation policies so that they benefit poor people and contribute to poverty reduction?
· How should the existence of climate change modify poverty reduction strategies?

BOX 1.1 Multiple reports explore the complex relationship between development and climate change

This report is just one of many produced by the World Bank Group in the past two years on climate change, mitigation, and development. The scope of this flagship report is on climate change and poverty, and it does not pretend to cover all the dimensions of the complex interplay between climate change and development. In particular, a number of other reports on mitigation, adaptation, and development, along with private-sector involvement, provide analyses that complement the findings of this report.
On mitigation, the recent report Decarbonizing Development: 3 Steps to a Zero-Carbon Future provides policy advice to help put countries on a path toward decarbonizing development. On Thin Ice: How Cutting Pollution Can Slow Warming and Save Lives reviews the scientific impacts of methane and black carbon and strategies to reduce emissions. And the annual State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report reviews the ever-changing landscape of country-level climate-mitigation policies.
On adaptation and development, this report relies on the World Development Report 2014, which focuses on managing risk (including natural risk, and opportunities for poverty reduction), and the three volumes of the Turn Down the Heat reports, which review the science of global climate change and provide detailed assessments on regional impacts. Building Resilience: Integrating Climate

and Disaster Risk into Development explores solutions for both protecting lives and livelihoods and decreasing damages from natural disasters. Climate-Smart Development examines the many benefits of climate-smart development, including those for health, agricultural yields, and employment. And Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa's Infrastructure assesses the impact of climate change on infrastructure development in Africa, especially in the power and water sectors.
On the private sector, the report on Mobilizing Public and Private Funds for Inclusive Green Growth Investment in Developing Countries provides guidance on how to scale-up existing innovative mechanisms to mobilize private capital for green growth. And the report on an Enabling Environment for Private Sector Adaptation outlines how to create an environment for private sector participation in promoting climate-resilient development paths.
Other organizations have also recently produced major reports that contribute to the discussion on development and climate, including the OECD's Aligning Policies for a Low-Carbon Economy, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate's Better Growth, Better Climate, the IMF's Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications, and UNEP's Adaptation Gap Report.

Recognizing that poor people are more vulnerable, does climate change influence what should be the priority for poverty reduction? Is there a risk of a ""global poverty trap"" if people who are still in extreme poverty are unable to adapt to climate change and thus escape poverty? And how can we ensure that the goal of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030 is not achieved in a way that creates greater vulnerability post-2030?
This report builds on the existing literature--especially the review by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)--on the links between climate and

poverty, including the role of socioeconomic trends (like growth and demography) and patterns (like inequality and governance) in mediating impacts (Olsson et al. 2014).
It explores three main channels through which climate has always affected poverty: (i) agricultural production, ecosystems, and food security; (ii) natural disasters; and (iii) health. It fills in some gaps in the literature and uses data and modeling analyses to provide quantifications (or at least, orders of magnitude) for some of the qualitative statements that can be found in the literature. We combine, for example, large datasets on household characteristics and location with recent global flood and drought modeling to

examine whether poor people are more exposed and vulnerable to natural disasters and how this is likely to change with climate change. We also explore whether lower agricultural yields will occur in places vulnerable to hunger, and the role that ecosystems play in reducing both poverty and risk in poor communities.
We then present the results of a new modeling exercise that builds on the collected knowledge in each main channel--agriculture, natural disasters, and health--to explore the potential impacts of climate change on poverty in 92 developing countries by 2030, investigating how these impacts are different in more or less optimistic scenarios of socioeconomic development. Finally, we explore policy options with an eye on the long term, and discuss how the stabilization of climate change can be made compatible with poverty eradication.
Our assessments--and quantification exercises--cannot be considered a comprehensive estimate of the impact of climate change on poverty. However, they are sufficient to demonstrate that climate change poses a significant obstacle to eradicating extreme poverty in the days and decades ahead. They also stress that we can act and reach poverty-eradication goals--in spite of climate change--by combining rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development and targeted interventions (to cope with shortterm impacts) with pro-poor mitigation policies (to avoid long-term impacts).
Climate change is an obstacle for people to escape poverty
Given that economic growth plays a critical role in reducing poverty, a key concern for poverty eradication is the impact of climate change on growth. Indeed, in the past, the income of the bottom 20 percent of the population has increased much more as a result of increases in the average income than from increases in the share of the income that goes to the bottom quintiles (Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay 2013;

Dollar and Kraay 2002). This relationship could of course change in the future if governments implement substantial redistributive policies (Ferreira and Ravallion 2009; Robalino and Warr 2006). But substantial redistribution is not easy politically, and the poorest countries simply lack the resources to eradicate poverty through redistribution. Economic growth will thus be needed to bring people out of poverty (Ravallion 2010).
At this point, we know that climate affects economic growth, based on observations of past evolutions. Reduced rainfall in the 20th century partly explains Sub-Saharan Africa's slow growth (Barrios, Bertinelli, and Strobl 2010; Brown et al. 2010). And high temperatures in the second half of the 20th century may have slowed down growth in poor countries in both the agricultural and the industrial sectors (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012). One study also finds that every 1°C warming reduces income by 1.2 percent in the short run, and by 0.5 percent in the long run (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2009). Other studies have found even larger impacts-- including a 3.8 percent drop in income in the long run for every 1°C warming (Horowitz 2009).
But what should countries expect from global warming in the future? Here, the evidence is inconclusive, with estimates based on very simple, partial models that vary widely (Pindyck 2013; Stern 2013). Most studies find a relatively limited impact on GDP. The latest Synthesis Report of the IPCC states that ""incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for additional temperature increases of [about] 2.5°C above pre- industrial levels are between 0.2 and 2.0% of income"" (figure 1.1), but adds that these estimates are likely to underestimate actual impacts. In particular, existing estimates have focused on limited warming (below 3°C) and do not include many sources of impacts that may prove consequential--such as the impact of ecosystems on economic activity, or the risk from surprises and tipping points. Studies including these elements, even in a simplistic manner, have found much larger potential impacts (Stern 2006; Weitzman 2014). As a result, the confidence in these estimates is limited, especially for warming that exceeds 2°C (IPCC 2014a).
Based on these macroeconomic estimates of future aggregate impacts of climate change, the impacts on poverty via the GDP channel are small--possibly less than 1 percent by 2050 (Skoufias, Rabassa, and Olivieri 2011).
But of course, climate change does not only affect poor people via economic aggregates, it also can affect them directly. In fact, its direct impacts will likely be more significant than the growth-mediated one, and may not significantly affect aggregate GDP, since poor people represent a very small share of global income. This is because climate change can affect household consumption (and thus consumption-related poverty) through four channels almost independently of aggregate growth:
· Prices. Consumption in real terms is driven by price levels and relative prices, which can be affected by multiple trends, shocks, and policies. Spikes in prices of basic goods can have large impacts on poverty numbers (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012), and climate change may increase the level and volatility of food prices and thus hurt poor people who usually spend a large share of their income on food (chapter 2).
· Assets. Households escape poverty by accumulating assets (Moser 2008). For instance, they acquire education or information, improve their health, and invest in productive assets such as livestock or manufacturing equipment. Assets usually include the financial, physical, human, social, and natural capital that households own. They also include public goods, infrastructure, and institutions that households have access to. Climate change can affect asset accumulation and poverty reduction by destroying assets during disasters or affecting people's incentive and ability to invest in new assets (chapter 3), or by affecting people's health (chapter 4).

· Productivity. Households can increase the return on their assets (including labor) by being more efficient and improving production processes, although returns are often limited by economic inefficiencies (such as corruption, market failures, and inappropriate regulations). Returns are also affected by changes in the price of what households produce. Climate change can decrease these returns through lower agricultural yields (chapter 2) and labor productivity (chapter 4), or increase them through higher agricultural prices (chapter 2).
· Opportunities. Households can also increase their income by expanding their range of activities or migrating, typically to cities (Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014). This is possible thanks to new opportunities in new sectors and activities. But those opportunities are often limited by exclusion (for example, based on gender or ethnicity) and constraints on mobility. And climate

3 6  S H O C K W A V E S

change can worsen the situation through more conflicts, increased competition for resources, higher risk aversion, or poorly designed adaptation policies (such as greater reliance on nonportable safety nets; chapter 5).
Of course, these channels interact closely. Lower agricultural productivity could lead to higher food prices, which can make it impossible for some households to continue saving and build their asset stock. Capturing new opportunities requires investments and sometimes migration, activities that are possible only with an appropriate asset base. And price changes will affect consumption (for net buyers) and income (for net sellers) simultaneously.
If poor people are disproportionally affected by climate change impacts through these channels, the impact of climate change on poverty will be larger than what is suggested by the macro impact on GDP--and climate change can lead to a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction. To explore this question, the report examines the impacts of climate change on poor and vulnerable people and draws implications for future poverty reduction. We start with current poverty dynamics to identify the obstacles to p overty reduction that are most likely to be affected by climate change.

Climatic events already affect the dynamics of poverty, which will be worsened by climate change
Poverty reduction is not a one-way transition out of poverty. Recent data show that about a third of urban Indonesian residents moved in or out of poverty in less than a decade (Gentilini, forthcoming)--and such large flows are consistently found in surveys around the world (Baulch 2011; Beegle, De Weerdt, and Dercon 2006; Dang, Lanjouw, and Swinkels 2014; Krishna 2006; Lanjouw, McKenzie, and Luoto 2011).
Take the case of 36 communities in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India, over a 25-year period. As figure 1.2 shows, 14 p ercent of households in the 36 communities escaped poverty every year, while 12 percent of nonpoor households became poor--resulting in a 2 percent net annual decrease in overall poverty (Krishna 2007).2 The fact that the net flow out of poverty is much smaller than the gross flows in and out of poverty means that a relatively small change in the gross flows can have a significant effect on the net flows and thus overall poverty dynamics. In this example, if the flow into poverty increased from 12 to 13 percent per year or the flow out of poverty slowed from 14 to 13 percent per year, that would cut the pace of poverty reduction by half.
Climate events and environmental degradation can make people fall in poverty. How can climate change affect these flows in and out of poverty? We know that natural hazards and climate conditions are involved in many cases where households fall into poverty, notably because of the shocks they create or contribute to. Table 1.1 shows the results of 15 household surveys in six developing countries--Afghanistan, India, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malawi, Peru, and Uganda--which ask people whether they have experienced a shock in the past year (Heltberg, Oviedo, and Talukdar 2015; World Bank 2013). Among the six categories of shocks, three of the most commonly reported can be directly

related to weather events and environmental conditions:
· Price shocks can be linked to lower agricultural production--for instance, following a shock like the 2010 Russian droughts or as a result of a long-term trend--and they can reduce poor people's consumption, pushing them into poverty and making it even tougher to save and accumulate assets.
· Many natural disasters are climate related. These include asset and crop or livestock loss that can be provoked by natural hazards such as droughts and water scarcity, and floods and storms. Natural disasters can bring people into poverty by destroying their assets--forcing them to either use their savings or borrow to repair or replace them--or by impacting health and education.
· Health issues (death and illness) are influenced by climate and environmental conditions, as shown by the relationship between rainfall and malaria outbreaks or the role of temperature in the number of cases of diarrhea. Moreover, health shocks remain the primary reason why people fall into poverty, owing to a combination of health expenditures, reduced income (for the sick or their caregivers), and long-term consequences on productivity (like disability).

Source: Wodon et al. 2014. Note: Households from five countries in the region are asked to report impacts from weather shocks in the last 5 years.

In addition, employment can be affected by climate events indirectly, because demand for work can decrease as a response to disasters (as when productive capital is destroyed by a storm) (Hallegatte 2008). It can also be affected by the degradation of natural resources and ecosystems, in which climate can play a role.
Climate change is expected to make many of these shocks worse (for an in-depth discussion, see chapters 2, 3, and 4). The effect of these shocks on poverty is all the more important given that people in lower income quintiles often appear more exposed and vulnerable to weather shocks than the rest of the population. In the Middle East and North Africa, a recent survey of five countries found that the bottom three quintiles are more exposed to weather shocks than the

3 8  S H O C K W A V E S

top two, especially in terms of income losses (table 1.2). Other household surveys show a similar story.
Climate-related shocks push people into poverty. In the Andhra Pradesh communities, among households falling into poverty, 44 percent cite ""drought, irrigation failure, or crop disease"" as one of the reasons for their descent. A household affected by droughts in the past is 15 times more likely to fall into poverty (Krishna 2006). In Bangladesh, of nearly 400 households falling into poverty, 15 percent cite natural disasters and 18 percent the loss of natural assets as the main reasons (Sen 2003). Changed weather patterns and modified rainfall may increase or decrease the frequency and intensity of such weather shocks and therefore change the flow of households into poverty.
Climatic and environmental conditions affect the ability of households to escape poverty. Climate change may make it more difficult for poor people to increase their income and accumulate assets, or may even lead in extreme cases to ""poverty traps"" (that is, when people own so little that they cannot invest to increase their income). While evidence on the existence of poverty traps is mixed, surveys do suggest that poor people experience slow income growth and slow recovery from shocks (Antman and McKenzie 2007; Carter et al. 2007; Kraay and McKenzie 2014; Ravallion and Jalan 2001). And a slowing down of income growth for the poor would result in slower rates of poverty reduction.
At the household level, we know that asset accumulation offers a way out of poverty, often over several generations. In Guayaquil, Ecuador, a study on asset-poor households found that they start by accumulating housing capital through improving their dwelling (Moser and Felton 2007). This improves the quality of life, but also helps build human capital through better health, safety, and security. Next, households consume more durable goods and diversify their asset base by investing in productive assets (like children's education and financial capital) to better cope with negative shocks such as illness or natural

disasters. In Bangladesh, a recent study tells a similar story. Households that receive assets (such as livestock or a sewing machine, complete with income support and training) build and diversify their asset portfolio to increase their income and reduce vulnerability to negative shocks (Barrett et al. 2013).
Households also escape poverty because they have access to jobs with better wages, and in developing countries these jobs are largely created by private micro-, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), often in the informal sector. These firms therefore play a key role in reducing poverty, especially where many young people enter the job market (World Bank 2012). But recent studies show that these firms are particularly ill-equipped to anticipate and adapt to environmental change and prepare for natural disasters. In Turkey, more than 60 percent of the MSMEs interviewed in a recent study reported that they did not have enough understanding of climate risks and access to resources and financial and insurance instruments to manage climate-related risks (IFC and EBRD 2013). This lack of preparation translates into needless losses in economic activity and jobs, even in rich countries, as illustrated by case studies after (climate- or non-climate-related) disasters in the past (Groen and Polivka 2008; Kroll et al. 1991; Tierney 1997).
Climate and environmental shocks and degradation can also restrict asset accumulation and slow down poverty reduction (Carter et al. 2007; Dercon and Christiaensen 2011). Poor people who have little other means to cope with shocks may be forced to sell their productive assets, such as distress sales of livestock during drought periods (Little et al. 2006). They may also be forced to overextract environmental resources in a struggle for short-term survival (Reardon and Vosti 1995). Such strategies can lead to poverty traps when they undermine the resources poor people depend on for future income generation (Barbier 2010; Barrett, Travis, and Dasgupta 2011).
Climate-sensitive shocks can also have irreversible impacts on education and health, transmitting poverty from one generation to

F rom C limate C hange to P overt y and B ack : A F ramework 3 9

the next. While households with enough assets can be expected to smooth consumption following a shock, asset-poor households may smooth assets and destabilize consumption in an attempt to preserve the small productive resources they still have (Carter et al. 2007). This interruption in postdisaster consumption can result in irreversible impacts for children. A review of the literature elicits many examples from Sub-Saharan Africa, but also in Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere (Baez, de la Fuente, and Santos 2010; Maccini and Yang 2009).
· Following weather shocks in SubSaharan Africa, asset-poor households typically provide children with lowerquality nutrition (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006; Dercon and Porter 2014; Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005) and are less likely to take sick children for medical consultations (Jensen 2000). These behaviors have short- and long-term impacts, especially for children under the age of two--like stunted growth (Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005) and a greater tendency to get sick (Dercon and Porter 2014).
· After droughts in Côte d'Ivoire, school enrollment rates declined by 20 percent (Jensen 2000), and drought-affected households in Zimbabwe delayed the start of school for children on average 3.7 months, resulting in children completing 0.4 fewer grades (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006).
· In Ethiopia, children younger than 36 months at the apex of the 1984 famine were less likely to have completed primary school, with calculations suggesting this led to income losses of 3 percent per year (Dercon and Porter 2014).
Moreover, health challenges are not limited to shocks: malnutrition can be a chronic condition that is expected to worsen in a future with climate change (see chapter 4). Considering the importance of child health

and education for long-term prospects, productivity, and income, even a moderate impact of climate change on health and educational achievement could affect poverty visibly over the long term. And because poor households suffer disproportionately from climate impacts, it would reduce the chance for children from poor families to escape poverty, further harming social mobility and increasing the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
Increased risk can push poor households into low-risk, low-return strategies that keep them poor. Natural risk can affect people's prospects even before a disaster hits. Household choices on risk-return trade-offs depend on their ability to cope with potential negative futures (such as bad rainfall, reduced consumption, and lower demand). With less steady income, a larger percentage of total assets exposed, and reduced insurance coverage, poor people generally have a lower ability to adapt to bad outcomes than the rich. As a result, low-income households disproportionately choose low-risk activities, which are also low-return, perpetuating poverty (Bandyopadhyay and Skoufias 2013; Dercon and Christiaensen 2011; Elbers, Gunning, and Kinsey 2007; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013).
This effect can be as important as the actual impacts of a shock. In Zimbabwe, an agricultural study found that ex ante impacts from increased weather risk explain almost half of the reduction in income due to droughts (Elbers, Gunning, and Kinsey 2007). Such livelihood strategies often entail excessive and costly diversification of activities and less productive investments, thereby constraining wealth accumulation. This risk stance, in turn, discourages the adoption of new technologies and lowers incentives to invest in productive capital.
Risk exposure also reduces credit market willingness to lend--in other words, those with uninsured weather risk have limited access to credit and investments. Importantly, households consider their vulnerability to natural risks such as floods and droughts when

4 0  S H O C K W A V E S

making risk-related decisions in other domains--such as creating a business or migrating to a city. Research suggests that under fairly general conditions, the higher the background risk (due to floods or droughts), the less individuals are willing to take other risks (like innovation or entrepreneurship) (Gollier and Pratt 1996). Empirical evidence also provides support for this hypothesis in many places (Ahsan 2014; Cameron and Shah 2015; van den Berg, Fort, and Burger 2009), although not everywhere (Bchir and Willinger 2013).
Poor people can be protected by the support and tools they have access to. People rely on multiple support systems to manage risks and trends--like their household and family, the community, the socioeconomic system around them (including the financial system), and the government (World Bank 2013). How much support they receive will largely determine the impact of various shocks and stresses on their welfare and their ability to escape poverty (chapter 5). For instance, financial instruments (like bank accounts and insurance contracts) help households and firms adapt to climate change, prepare for natural shocks, and recover when affected. Protected savings and borrowing also make it possible for households to cope with income losses while maintaining consumption and avoiding detrimental coping measures (like reducing food intake or taking children out of school).
Social insurance and social safety nets are also efficient tools to support poor people when they are affected by natural disasters or environmental and economic shocks. When droughts in East Africa caused food shortages and famine in 2011, Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program expanded coverage from 6.5 million to 9.6 million beneficiaries in two months and extended benefits from six to nine months per year. In addition, migration and remittances help people manage temporary or permanent shocks and escape poverty. Migrants typically benefit, as do their family and area of origin, from remittances, enhanced social networks, and better

information (Adger et al. 2002; Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014; Moser and Felton 2007).
Poverty reduction, socioeconomic trends, and non-climate policies affect climate risk
So we know that climate events and environmental degradation affect poverty reduction today. But the future impacts of climate change will depend on future conditions, including not only the magnitude and patterns of the change in climate but also the speed and direction of poverty reduction and future socioeconomic changes (Hallegatte, Przyluski, and Vogt-Schilb 2011). It is not hard to imagine that, in a world where everyone has access to water and sanitation, the impacts of climate change on waterborne diseases will be smaller than in a world where uncontrolled urbanization has led to widespread underserved settlements located in flood zones. Similarly, in a country whose workers mostly work outside or live and work without air conditioning, the impact of hotter weather on labor productivity and income will be stronger than in an industrialized economy. And a poorer household with a large share of its consumption dedicated to food will be more vulnerable to climate-related food price fluctuations than a wealthier household.
The impacts of--and risks from--climate change depend on the following three factors:
· Hazard: The physical event or trend (like a windstorm, a flood, or a trend in temperature), which is measured using physical metrics (like the maximum wind speed, the water level, or the temperature change over a decade) and is independent of any socioeconomic characteristics or human presence.
· Exposure: The population and the amount of assets that are located where the hazard can occur (like the population and houses located in a flood plain) or more generally that are potentially

affected by a hazard (like the population working in the agricultural sector and thus exposed to reduction in yields). · Vulnerability: The expected amount of loss, if a hazard occurs. This depends on the physical strength of exposed assets (a mud house tends to be more vulnerable to flood than a brick house); the technologies used (some agricultural techniques are more vulnerable to a decrease in precipitation); and the role of exposed assets for the community's well-being (the loss of a critical bridge typically results in higher losses than the reconstruction value).
How these three factors evolve is uncertain, given our lack of full understanding about the climate system and impacts of climate change (for instance, on ecosystems)-- as well as how socioeconomic systems evolve. But it is also uncertain because they can be affected by policies and therefore by our current and future choices. These two sources of uncertainty have very different implications: while the scientific uncertainty (for instance on how local climates will change and how physical and biological systems will respond) is a bad thing, because it impairs decision making and creates risks, the uncertainty due to our choices is good news, because it shows that our decisions can shape the future of climate change and its impacts.
These two sources of uncertainty also influence these factors differently at different time horizons. Emissions-reduction policies, even those implemented today, cannot significantly affect the rate and magnitude of climate change by 2030, so that the uncertainty about the hazard comes only from the scientific uncertainty: at this time horizon, reducing climate change impacts can be done only by reducing exposure and vulnerability. But for 2050 and beyond, greenhouse gas emissions and climate policies have a large impact on the climate change hazard: the scientific uncertainty and the policy uncertainty matter for the long-term climate change hazard. To account for these differences, this report uses

different scenarios for the analyses at different time horizons:
· Short-term hazard. In our analyses of the short-term impacts of climate change, by 2030, we use two scenarios for the magnitude of climate change impacts (lowimpact and high-impact scenarios) to represent the scientific uncertainty on how local climates will change in response to global climate change, and how physical and biological systems will respond (such as the effects of higher temperatures on ecosystems). These scenarios do not depend on emissions and extend to 2030.
· Long-term hazard. When analyzing the longer-term, beyond 2050, we use two scenarios for the future of global greenhouse gas emissions and climate change (low-emissions and high-emissions scenarios), which are driven by development trends and climate policies. Our low-emissions scenario is the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6, which is consistent with the objective of stabilizing climate change at 2°C above preindustrial temperatures (Van Vuuren et al. 2011). Our high-emissions scenario is the RCP8.5, which represents a world of high population and economic growth combined with a growing use of fossilfuel energy (Riahi et al. 2011). These scenarios extend to 2100, and are used for instance to discuss the long-term impact of climate change on agricultural production and food prices in chapter 2, or the future intensity of heat waves in chapter 3.
· Socioeconomic scenarios. To represent the uncertainty on the exposure and vulnerability, linked to development and adaptation policies, we also introduce two socioeconomic scenarios, the poverty and prosperity scenarios, which describe different possible evolutions of the world until the end of the century, in the absence of climate change. The prosperity scenario is optimistic, assuming that the World Bank's twin goals of extreme poverty eradication and

4 2  S H O C K W A V E S

shared prosperity are met by 2030, that popu lation g row th is slow i n developing countries, education levels and labor productivity increase rapidly, and the productivity gap between developing and developed countries decreases quickly. The poverty scenario is pessimistic, assuming high population growth, low economic growth, and greater inequalities between and within countries. Population and GDP growth in these two scenarios are based on two socioeconomic scenarios developed by the scientific community to support climate change research, the Shared SocioEconomic Pathways (SSPs), and we add projections for poverty until 2030 (chapter 6).3
The road map for our report
This report explores the impacts of climate change looking not only at varying intensities of climate change but also at how climate impacts will vary depending on progress made on poverty, inequality, and access to basic services and social protection. As such, chapters 2 to 4 present new analyses and provide a review of what we think are the three major channels through which climatesensitive events already affect people's movements in and out of poverty, namely the following:
· Agricultural production, ecosystems, and food security: Chapter 2 looks at how climate change will affect food prices, agricultural incomes, and the nonmarket consumption that is provided by ecosystems, and the consequences these effects will have on poverty dynamics. New analyses from five background papers are presented here. Two of them explore the impact of climate change (and policies) on agricultural yields, food prices, and food security, using different modeling approaches and assumptions (Biewald et al., forthcoming; Havlík

et al., forthcoming). Another study examines the global distribution of rural poverty in low-elevation coastal areas (Barbier, forthcoming). Two additional papers analyze the climate (rainfall and temperature) sensitivity of subsistence and cash incomes, and the relative vulnerability of poor households, using data from 58 sites representing smallholder production systems in (sub)tropical areas with good forest access (Angelsen and Dokken, forthcoming; Noack et al., forthcoming). · Natural disasters: Chapter 3 reviews the changes that are expected in the distribution, frequency, and intensity of natural hazards, exploring the exposure and vulnerability of poor and nonpoor people to these shocks. While previous studies rely on self-reported shocks (which can be biased), this chapter provides ample evidence to support the finding that poor people are more exposed and more vulnerable. New analyses drawing on a variety of data sources (such as people's occupations and livelihoods, expenditures, location, housing types, asset portfolios, and the ability to cope with and react to shocks and economic or environmental change) from three background papers are presented in this chapter. Two papers investigate the relative exposure of poor and nonpoor people to floods, droughts, and extreme heat in 52 developing countries by combining hazard data with household surveys (Park et al., forthcoming; Winsemius et al., forthcoming). Another paper focuses on the city of Mumbai, India, and explores the exposure, vulnerability, and ability of poor urban dwellers to respond, based on survey data collected for this report (Patankar, forthcoming). · Health: Chapter 4 discusses the effects of health shocks on poverty and explores how climate change can magnify already existing health risks that have consequences for people's ability to escape

F rom C limate C hange to P overt y and B ack : A F ramework 4 3

or stay out of poverty. This chapter is a review of existing work, bringing together the literature on the economic impact of disease and poor health and what we know about the potential effects of climate change on health.
These three chapters also explore the policy options within each of these sectors that can help reduce impacts--a discussion that is expanded upon in chapter 5 to include cross-sectoral options such as social protection and migration. Chapter 5 investigates various tools and support systems, looking at whether poor people have access to them, and reviews recent innovations to make financial instruments, social safety nets, and remittances more efficient and useful for poor people. It also discusses the role of governance systems in designing these instruments and the policies that drive poverty reduction and risk management and adaptation to climate change. New insights from four background papers are presented here. The first explores the social inequalities that shape the ability to cope with and adapt to climate change, especially for the poor and nonpoor (Tschakert, forthcoming). The second models the performance of different designs of social protection schemes in protecting poor people under increasing climate change (Carter and Janzen, forthcoming). And two case studies examine how social protection can protect poor people against natural hazards and environmental changes, looking at Ethiopia and its Productive Safety Net Program and the Philippines and its response to Typhoon Haiyan (Bowen, forthcoming; Johnson and Bowen, forthcoming).
Chapter 6 brings all of the findings together to highlight the extent to which overall development patterns will condition how climate change affects poverty. Based on a background paper for this report, it presents the results of a novel modeling exercise that examines how climate change would affect extreme poverty in 2030 looking across

different scenarios of future development, and thus at worlds with different levels of exposure and vulnerability (Rozenberg and Hallegatte, forthcoming). Encouragingly, it finds that, if socioeconomic trends and policies manage to minimize the exposure and vulnerability of poor people to climate change by 2030, a large fraction of the negative impact of climate change on poor people can be prevented. These results highlight the window of opportunity to act now to promote rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development and reduce the future impacts of climate change that cannot be avoided through mitigation measures.
How development is done, and in particular how low carbon it is, will determine the longer-term impacts of climate change on poverty. This means moving quickly now to decarbonize development to make poverty reduction and climate change stabilization compatible (box 1.2). Multiple reports have been published on mitigation policies. The recent IPCC report reviews possible pathways toward zero net carbon emissions and discusses the policies that can be implemented to follow these pathways (IPCC 2014c). Three other reports--the World Bank's Decarbonizing Development, the OECD's Aligning Policies for a Low-Carbon Economy, and the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate's Better Growth, Better Climate (Fay et al. 2015; OECD 2015; NCE 2014)--also explore policy options, from carbon pricing to innovation, environmental performance standards, and land use and urban planning.
In this report, we do not present a detailed discussion of mitigation policies, but chapter 2 touches on the impact of land-based mitigation policies (like fighting deforestation) on poverty, and chapter 6 explores how to design mitigation policies that do not slow down poverty reduction-- in particular by combining mitigation policies with measures to protect poor and vulnerable people against potential negative impacts.

BOX 1.2 A call for zero net CO2 emissions by 2100

The scientific reality is that as long as human societies release CO2 in quantities greater than natural carbon sinks (such as forests and other vegetation) can absorb, the climate will continue changing, with corresponding risks for well-being, development, and poverty reduction (IPCC 2014a). This is why the international community committed to the goal of keeping global temperature increases below 2°C, and thus to the full decarbonization of the global economy (UNFCCC 2010; G7 2015).
Because energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves, maintaining global warming below 2°C, or even 3°C, requires immediate action. This requires a radical change in development patterns. For instance, a background study for this report finds that it will be very difficult to remain below a 2°C warming if the carbon intensity of new development exceeds 73 gCO2/$ (grams of carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of GDP) on average at the global level

(Rozenberg et al. 2015). As a reference, the carbon intensity of global GDP today is around 360 gCO2/$. There is no country--except those that outsource emissions (like Singapore or Hong Kong SAR, China)--whose carbon intensity of GDP today approaches 100 gCO2/$. This is true even of countries that produce most of their electricity from nonfossil energy sources (such as Brazil and France).
Moreover, delaying action locks the global economy into a carbon-intensive pathway--where it becomes increasingly more difficult and expensive to reduce CO2 emissions sufficiently to stay within a low budget of cumulative emissions--because of the long lifetime and relatively high capital cost of energy infrastructure. Each year that additional mitigation efforts are delayed (that is, we continue along the current path), the required carbon intensity of new production decreases by 20 to 50 gCO2/$ for a 2°C budget.

Notes
1. Until this year, extreme poverty was defined using the $1.25 poverty line, based on the 2005 PPP exchange rates. Since the publication of the Global Monitoring Report (World Bank 2015a), the poverty line is defined by a consumption threshold at $1.90, using the 2011 PPP exchange rates. These two poverty lines are consistent, and the country-level poverty headcounts calculated using the two definitions are close (Jolliffe and Prydz 2015).
2. Similar findings exist in many countries and regions, see for instance data for four other countries in Krishna (2007), for Bangladesh in Sen (2003), and for South Africa in Carter and May (2011).
3. The prosperity scenario uses population and GDP projections from SSP5 and the poverty scenario uses SSP4 (O'Neill et al. 2015). While we use the quantification of the SSPs for population and GDP, we do not retain the narratives associated to these SSPs, especially regarding the energy mix. For more information on the SSPs, see https://www2.cgd.ucar.edu /research/iconics. While the SSPs go to 2100,

we can only add poverty projections until 2030 (see chapter 6 for details on the methodology and its limits).

2 Bad Seed: Climate Change,
Agriculture, and Food Security

Main Messages

· Climate change impacts on agriculture are already evident in vulnerable regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, even as they remain globally limited. Future impacts are highly uncertain, but are expected to be significant--even when accounting for adaptive behaviors and trade. Land-based mitigation can also bring risks for food production and prices.
· Production and price impacts--whether triggered by climate change or climate policies--significantly affect poor people. Net-consumers of food products will be harmed, while those who depend on agricultural wages and profits will experience mixed impacts.

· Climate change adds to the stress on ecosystems and makes them even more fragile. Impacts for poor communities dependent on ecosystem-based livelihoods can be large-- cutting their subsistence production and removing one of their safety nets--but are still impossible to quantify.
· In the shorter term, food stocks, better access of poor farmers to markets, improved technologies, and climate-smart production practices can reduce climate impacts. Over the longer term, negative impacts can be avoided only through mitigation actions, including in agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. These actions can be designed to avoid negative impacts or even to benefit local production and incomes.

Introduction
What are the key obstacles hindering poor people from escaping poverty and making them vulnerable to falling back into poverty? Household surveys investigating this question reveal that changes in prices, employment shocks, or death of livestock and crop

failures are among the chief culprits. And we know that many of these shocks can be triggered by climate-related events, whose frequency and severity will increase with climate change. In particular, the pace of poverty reduction could be affected by climate change impacts on agriculture and ecosystems.

This chain of events is expected to occur because climate change will seriously affect land and water productivity. This, in turn, will increase food prices and affect wages and incomes, especially in the agriculture sector. The impact of such changes in prices and earnings on households depends on their consumption basket and income sources. Food dominates the consumption basket of poor households, whose livelihoods--particularly in poor countries--are often derived from agriculture and other environmental goods and services.
This chapter explores how climate change and climate policies could affect poor people through these channels. Importantly, these effects can be triggered either by short-lived natural disasters or by more gradual, longterm changes in climate conditions. While natural disasters are discussed at length in chapter 3, this chapter focuses on long-term changes and trends that threaten poor people. But the line is often blurred between shocks and trends, and the two interact closely. For instance, tight agricultural markets--due notably to limited food stocks--make it more likely that a relatively small event in one region (such as a drought in a major exporting country) translates into a food price crisis, as illustrated by the consequences of the 2010 Russian drought.
We begin by reviewing the possible impacts of climate change and mitigation policies on food security--in terms of agricultural yields, food prices, and food availability--and the consequences for poor households of such changes and the associated impacts on ecosystems the poor depend on. We then examine how socioeconomic development, improved technologies, better infrastructure and market access, and well-designed land mitigation policies could help.
Our main message is that climate change can have significant impacts on agricultural yields and food prices, as well as ecosystembased livelihoods, which will particularly affect poor consumers and rural people. However, impacts will remain globally limited (but locally significant) until 2030 and can be largely managed through good policies during this period. Beyond 2030, impacts can become

large and well-designed mitigation policies are the only way to reduce longer-term risks.
Climate change and climate policies will impact food security
Agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in many poor countries. It is also directly critical to households' food security. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most sensitive to climate change given its dependence on weather conditions, both directly and through climate-dependent stressors (pests, epidemics, and sea level rise). In fact, some of the most severe poverty impacts of climate change are expected to be channeled through agriculture.
In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that there is high confidence that all aspects of food security will be negatively affected by climate change (IPCC 2014). However, the extent to which yields and prices will be affected is hard to predict. Uncertainty about future precipitation and temperature change are compounded by uncertainties regarding the likely response of crop growth to changes in climate conditions. Further, the magnitude of CO2 fertilization (that is, the process through which higher CO2 concentrations directly accelerate plant growth) is still unknown. As a result, climate change impacts on crop yields and prices are highly uncertain and vary across regions, crops, and adaptation scenarios, depending on crop models, economic models, and underlying assumptions (Nelson et al. 2014).
This chapter adds to the rapidly growing knowledge on climate change and agriculture by presenting the results of new modeling exercises undertaken for this report--one on hunger vulnerability (Biewald et al., forthcoming) and one on food prices (Havlík et al., forthcoming). These exercises combine a crop model for biophysical yield impacts with an economic and trade model to calculate production and price impacts under a variety of scenarios, including with and without CO2 fertilization, and distinguishing between

B ad S eed : C limate C hange , A gric u lt u re , and F ood S ec u rit y  5 1

short-term (until 2030) and longer-term (until 2080) impacts.1

FIGURE 2.1 Climate change could sharply reduce crop yields (Change in yields compared to no climate change)

Climate change could reduce yields in many places, especially the poorest
As shown in the latest IPCC assessment, food production will be directly affected by changes in climatic conditions (Porter et al., 2014): Crop yields and harvest quality are susceptible to extreme events and changing precipitation and temperature. Livestock production can be impacted by grazing land productivity and quality, heat stress, and water availability. The distribution and abundance of aquatic species will change with negative impacts expected for fish production in developing countries in tropical areas.
Notwithstanding high uncertainties, the IPCC concludes with high confidence that crop production will consistently and negatively be affected by climate change in the longer term and in low-latitude countries (IPCC 2014). Projected impacts vary across crops, regions, and adaptation scenarios with positive and negative impacts being equally possible before 2050. Beyond that, risks of negative impacts become more severe.
Accordingly, Havlík et al. (Forthcoming) show that climate change is likely to have a detrimental impact although impacts remain limited in the shorter term. As figure 2.1 shows, in a high-emissions scenario, declines in average crop yields remain limited in 2030 once the positive effect of CO2 fertilization is accounted for, and do not exceed 10 percent even without CO2 fertilization. Beyond 2030, the severity of the damage will depend on the actions countries take to decrease their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In a low- emissions scenario, overall crop yield losses could be stabilized at less than 8 percent by 2080 compared to a situation without climate change (and with CO2 fertilization, net gains are even possible). But if GHG emissions continue to increase on an uncontrolled path (high-emissions scenario), yields could decrease by up to 20 percent (on average 14 percent across climate models) in 2080 even with CO2 fertilization--and up to more than 30 percent without CO2 fertilization.

Climate-induced yield reductions are not homogenous. Climate change will benefit some cold regions in the short run, but these regions are relatively wealthy. In contrast, it will hit other regions especially hard, particularly the poorest ones. By 2080, the average yield declines estimated from all climate models could be as severe as 23 percent for South Asia, 17 percent for East Asia and the Pacific, 15 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, and 14 percent for Latin America--even with CO2 fertilization (Havlík et al., forthcoming). But if CO2 fertilization effects do not materialize, overall impacts can be more severe, with all regions experiencing negative yield changes. Using another crop and economic model brings similar results (Biewald et al., forthcoming): its finer spatial resolution shows that yield impacts will also vary greatly within countries, with some regions benefiting while others lose much more than the regional or country average. Climate change could even make agricultural areas unsuitable for cultivation of key crops, resulting in large economic impacts for poor economies that are highly dependent on a few agricultural commodities (box 2.1).

5 2  S H O C K W A V E S

BOX 2.1 Climate change could pose major hurdles for Africa's leading cocoa and coffee producers

Climate change can modify the suitability of particular locations for agriculture production, which could be a major challenge for agriculture-dependent economies. In Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire, areas suitable for cocoa production could be negatively affected by climate change--a major problem for two countries whose economies depend critically on employment and revenues from this export crop (map B2.1.1). Similarly, in Uganda, the leading coffee producer in Africa, significant declines in most areas suitable for coffee production are possible (Jassogne, Läderach, and van Asten 2013).

History suggests that specialized economies find it difficult to recover from the collapse of their main activity. For instance, one study shows that regions affected by the Dust Bowl in the United States in the 1930s never returned to their predrought production levels, with most adjustment taking place through outmigration toward other areas (Hornbeck 2012). Since production of such cash crops will be affected slowly, a well-prepared transition toward other production--in agriculture, manufacturing, or services--would be well advised.

Biophysical impacts affect prices and food availability
The biophysical impacts on crop yields will also trigger changes in production and food prices. The impact of these changes will depend on how farmers and countries adapt to them. Farmers can adjust input use (fertilizer and irrigation) and cultivated area to compensate for some of the yield losses; and countries can buffer their production deficit by increasing their food imports. (These are the adaptation options used in the background modeling for this chapter.) Food prices will evolve depending on the interplay of demand and supply of food, which may be affected by public policies regarding food stock management and trade policies as well as management of losses during storage and transport.
What happens to agricultural prices is particularly critical for poverty given their impact on poor households' budget and income. According to the IPCC, changes in temperature and precipitation are likely to result in higher food prices by 2050, but the magnitude remains highly uncertain with increases ranging from 3 to 84 percent without CO2 fertilization effects, and between decreases of 30 percent and increases of 45 percent with CO2 fertilization (IPCC 2014). These estimates may be optimistic in that they do not account for impacts of pests, diseases, interaction with local pollution, and extreme weather events. Extreme events in particular could put global food systems at risk (U.K.­ U.S. Task Force 2015).
Impacts also depend on socioeconomic trends, including technological change and population growth. This is why all simulations are performed under two socioeconomic scenarios--labeled prosperity and poverty--that represent different evolutions of the world's population and economy. The prosperity scenario is optimistic, assuming that the World Bank's twin goals of extreme poverty eradication and shared prosperity are met by 2030, that population growth is slow in developing countries, education levels and labor productivity increase rapidly,

and the productivity gap between developing and developed countries decreases quickly. The poverty scenario is more pessimistic, assuming high population growth, low economic growth, and greater inequalities between and within countries (see chapter 1 for a discussion of the scenario approach used in this report).
Over the long term, the risks of harmful price impacts could be high, especially without CO2 fertilization. The simulations carried out for this report (figure 2.2) suggest that in scenarios with continued high emissions and no CO2 fertilization, climate change would increase world agricultural prices by 4 to 5.5 percent in 2030. Over time, these impacts increase and could be as large as 30 percent by 2080.2 With CO2 fertilization, impacts on global prices remain limited even with high emissions.
Regions are affected very differently by climate change induced price changes, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia the most severely impacted (figure 2.2). Impacts on prices could be as high as 12 percent in 2030 and 70 percent by 2080 in Sub-Saharan Africa in a worst-case scenario (poverty and high emissions without CO2 fertilization). In the same worst-case scenario, prices would rise by 5 percent by 2030 and 23 percent by 2080 in South Asia, 4 percent and 9 percent in East Asia and the Pacific, and 3 percent and 12 percent in Latin America. Even with CO2 fertilization, in 2080 prices would be 29 percent higher in Sub-Saharan Africa and 16 percent in South Asia.
As for food availability, unmitigated climate change has the potential to cancel out a large fraction of the food security gains from technological change and economic growth and can be a threat in regions that already have low levels of food intake per capita and will experience high levels of population growth.
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are particularly vulnerable. In those regions, without climate change, per capita food availability could increase at least to a level equivalent to 80 percent of the current food availability in developed countries by 2080,

even in a poverty scenario (figure 2.3). However, in the high-emissions scenario, calories per capita grow until 2030 and then stagnate, remaining 7 to 10 percent lower than in the no climate change world even when adaptation and trade possibilities are accounted for. What is particularly worrisome about these simulations is that in Africa and South Asia, the increases in daily calories plateau at levels far below those of developed countries today. In other regions and in the prosperity scenario, impacts are much smaller and appear more manageable because of the much higher baseline levels.
Ill-designed land-based mitigation policies can also be a threat for food security
In the longer term, countries will need to look into well-designed land-based mitigation policies to stabilize climate change (see chapter 6 for a discussion of mitigation needs and policies). Here, the agriculture, forestry, and other land uses (AFOLU) sector will be a key player, in addition to fulfilling its already critical role in providing food and supporting rural livelihoods.

It can contribute by reducing direct nonCO2 emissions of existing agricultural production, and, even more important, by avoiding deforestation, increasing carbon sequestration through afforestation, and producing biomass for energy generation. The IPCC estimates that land-based mitigation, including bioenergy, could contribute 20 to 60 percent of total cumulative abatement up to 2030, and 15 to 40 percent up to 2100 (Smith and Bustamante 2014). Distributing mitigation efforts in a cost-efficient way across sectors could require a decrease in emissions from AFOLU by 64 percent in 2030, compared to their 2000 level (Havlík et al., forthcoming).
Yet such mitigation efforts could affect food prices and availability given the critical role of land in agricultural production. The IPCC concludes that large-scale, land-based mitigation at the global scale, especially bioenergy expansion, can reduce the availability of land for food production, with implications for food security (Smith and Bustamante 2014). Many studies show that regional and local commodity prices (like food, timber, and energy) could rise as a result (Chen et al. 2011; Golub et al. 2013; Kuik 2013).

Food price impacts could be severe for largescale bioenergy deployment--especially when combined with protecting natural forests (Calvin et al. 2013; Popp et al. 2011; Wise et al. 2009).
The simulations carried out for this report show that mitigation policies implemented through a uniform global carbon price, which does not account for food production implications, would hurt crop and livestock production and result in lower food availability compared to a hypothetical baseline without climate change and climate policies (Havlík et al., forthcoming).3 Such policies could even have price impacts that are larger than those of climate change (figure 2.4). Other, more carefully designed, policies, however, could lead to price impacts that are smaller than those caused by unmitigated climate change (Lotze-Campen et al. 2014). Nevertheless, these findings warn against climate policies that would not be sensitive to food security issues, and emphasize the need to protect poor people against the negative side effects of land-mitigation policies.

""All Technologies"" is a mitigation scenario in which all available technologies enter into the solution portfolio according to their relative competitiveness. ""High Energy Efficiency"" involves the same technologies but assumes higher investments in energy efficiency leading to final energy demand lower by 20 to 30 percent in 2050 and by 35 to 45 percent in 2100.

Poor people are vulnerable to climate impacts through prices and ecosystems
How are the poor affected by climate-related impacts on food production and prices? Increased agricultural prices will affect consumers through higher expenditure for basic goods, but will benefit net sellers and those who earn wages from agricultural employment. However, the increase in prices may be the result of a decline in productivity that would reduce returns from farm activities and agricultural wages, so that the net effect on sellers will depend on the interplay between prices and output. In addition, many poor people--especially those in rural areas--do not buy or sell consumption goods in markets, but produce them from ecosystems to meet subsistence needs (for example, nontimber products provided by forests, production of crops, or small fishery catches), which may be extremely climate sensitive.
Poor people will be affected by higher agricultural prices as consumers and producers
Because climate change and climate policies are likely to affect the prices of basic goods-- particularly food--they will alter the purchasing power and real income of households. However, the overall impact on poverty will depend on both how much the prices of these basic goods are affected and whether the households are net buyers or net sellers.
Poor consumers are highly vulnerable to food price hikes. The higher share of income that poor people spend on food makes them particularly vulnerable to rising prices or price volatility on food items. Across the developing world, the poorest households spend between 40 percent and 60 percent of their income on food and beverages compared to less than 25 percent of wealthier households (figure 2.5). In some African countries, such as Burundi, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, and Tanzania, food consumption of the

Consumption groups defined based on global income distribution data: poorest = $2.97 per capita a day; poor = between $2.97 and $8.44 per capita a day; middle = between $8.44 and $23.03 per capita a day; wealthier = above $23.03 per capita a day.

poorest households amounts to over 70 percent of their total expenditure. Poor people in urban areas often have even higher food expenditure than rural people, as the latter can also self-produce some of their food needs.
How poor people are affected by a particular food item's price rise depends on their ability to respond to price changes by modifying their diets toward cheaper foods. Overall, demand response for basic food products has been found to be limited, especially in the case of a generalized increase in food price levels (Ivanic and Martin 2008), or for staple foods (such as tortillas in Mexico) (Wood, Nelson, and Nogueira 2012). But poorer households are more likely to reduce food consumption in the face of higher prices, with a 10 percent increase in food price levels translating into a reduction in daily food intake by 301 kilojoules (72 kilocalories) in low-income countries (Green et al. 2013). Such impacts could lead to undernutrition, with potentially severe health impacts, especially on children (see chapter 4).

Price increases can benefit agricultural producers and laborers. A rise in agricultural prices is likely also to lead to an increase in agricultural profits and wages. The poverty impacts of price-induced changes in earnings depend on how vulnerable households make a living. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a recent study shows that almost all rural households are self-employed in farm activities, earning 63 percent of their income from these sources compared to only 33 percent in non-African developing countries (Davis, Di Giuseppe, and Zezza 2014). More generally, the share of poor people who declare agriculture as their main income source is highest in poorer countries, though with substantial variation (figure 2.6). In India, agriculture remains the main preserve of the unskilled and disadvantaged people (Lanjouw and Murgai 2009). These households will be highly sensitive to any change in agricultural profits or wages.
In spite of the benefits for farmers who are net sellers of food, existing studies using multicountry samples tend to agree that, in the absence of changes in production and wages,

5 8  S H O C K W A V E S

a rise in food prices increases poverty rates in most countries due to the negative impacts on consumers. Simulations suggest that a 10 percent price rise in food prices--with no change in agriculture productivity--leads on average to a 0.8 percentage point increase in extreme poverty headcount rates; a 50 percent price

rise to a 5.8 percentage point poverty increase; and a 100 percent price rise to a 13 percentage point poverty increase (Ivanic and Martin 2014). The severity of poverty impacts will vary among countries--with Guatemala, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Yemen being the worst hit (figure 2.7).
Accordingly, food price spikes in the past already had significant poverty impacts. In a sample of 28 developing countries the global price spikes between June and December 2010, which increased food prices by an average 37 percent, increased the number of people in extreme poverty by 44 million (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012). The 2008 food price shock, resulting in price increases of over 100 percent, even resulted in an additional 100 million people in extreme poverty (Ivanic and Martin 2008).
Poverty impacts will also depend on the specific food crops for which prices increase. A 10 percent price increase for rice would increase poverty in Bangladesh by 0.67 percentage points and in Côte d'Ivoire by 0.42 percentage points, but reduce poverty by 1.37 percentage points in Cambodia and 0.29 percentage points in Vietnam (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012). Similarly, as seen in figure 2.7, a 10 percent price increase in all crops could lower poverty rates in Albania,

Cambodia, China, and Vietnam, while more extreme price shocks would have a poverty-reducing impact only in Cambodia and China. Modest price increases could lift a group of net-selling farmers out of poverty, while larger price rises would drop other groups into poverty.
In the longer run, wage and production adjustments are possible, but the net impact depends on productivity impacts. In the longer run, rising food prices will increase marginal returns from agriculture, which raises agricultural wages. While the effects of commodity price changes on rural wages could take some time to materialize, several studies have actually found that these adjustments could mediate poverty impacts of increased consumption prices (Devarajan et al. 2013; Ivanic and Martin 2014; Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias 2014). The wage response depends on the elasticity of the agricultural wage with respect to land productivity. The more limited the supply of labor to agriculture, the more responsive the agricultural wage to price shock, as seen in India (Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias 2014). Such responses may be observed if workers cannot easily move between sectors and if spatial mobility is limited.
Moreover, in the longer run, farmers respond to changing prices by adjusting their production. In some cases, they can switch land toward producing those items whose prices have risen relative to others or by increasing overall agricultural production through expansion of agricultural land or increases in other outputs. With these longrun adjustments and no change in productivity, extreme poverty could even decrease globally by as much as 1.4 percentage points under a 10 percent price rise and 8.7 percentage points under a 100 percent price rise (Ivanic and Martin 2014). However, these options are not always available to farmers.
And farmers are also directly affected by changes in land and labor productivity. For instance, data from Uganda between 2005 and 2011 suggest that a 10 percent reduction in water availability due to a lack of rainfall reduced crop income by 14.5 percent in

wealthier households, and by 20 percent in poorer ones (Hill and Mejia-Mantilla 2015 and figure 2.8). Interestingly, however, the average consumption decrease was the same in both sets of households--about 4 percent--suggesting the poorer ones made significant efforts to preserve consumption. Nevertheless, even small shocks can also push vulnerable households below the poverty line.
In addition, chapter 4 discusses the impact of high temperature on labor productivity. These effects are not accounted for in the agriculture models that are used in this chapter, but they could have significant effects on returns from all outdoor occupations, and especially agriculture.
The net effect of climate change on poverty, which is the combination of impacts on productivity, consumption prices, and incomes, is likely to be negative in many countries. In the 15-country sample used by Hertel, Burke, and Lobell (2010), climateinduced price rises increase extreme poverty by 1.8 percentage points--driven mostly by the negative impacts in countries with large populations (including Bangladesh and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Malawi, Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia).

Climate change modifies not only average climate conditions but also climate variability, with potential effects on poverty. One study estimates that by 2080, an increase in the intensity of extreme dry events would lead to a rise of extreme poverty by 0.53 percentage points in 16 developing countries with Bangladesh (1.35 percentage points), Mexico (1.76 percentage points), and Zambia (4.64 percentage points), most severely affected (Ahmed, Diffenbaugh, and Hertel 2009). Other significant effects would affect poor farmers through impacts on livestock, which are not only a source of income (box 2.2) but also used as an asset by poor households.
Nonagricultural households, which are net buyers of food--especially those in urban areas--will be the worst affected. A climateinduced rise in food prices could increase poverty rates of nonagricultural households by 20 to 50 percent in parts of Africa and Asia (Hertel, Burke, and Lobell 2010). Similarly, a once-in-30-year climate extreme would most severely affect urban laborers with a dramatic increase in poverty rates within this group in Bangladesh (31 percent), Malawi (111 percent), Mexico (95 percent), the Philippines (32 percent), and Zambia (102 percent) (Ahmed, Diffenbaugh, and Hertel 2009). With increasing urbanization rates, food price increases could have an even more severe poverty impact.

The analysis in chapter 6 also suggests that--even in the long run--the negative impacts through consumption prices and yields dominate the positive impacts on agricultural incomes in almost all scenarios, and the net effect of climate change is very likely to increase global poverty. A net decrease in poverty is not impossible, though, if many poor households stay in agriculture (the case in our poverty scenario) and if the impact of climate change remains moderate. That said, it occurs only in a small fraction of the scenarios--and only if institutions and labor markets are such that the extra revenue from higher prices is distributed fairly across workers and landowners. These results parallel those of a study on India, in which higher agricultural wages help poor households and, if the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity impacts remain low, could even benefit them (Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias 2014). But with greater productivity impacts, climate change will be increasingly likely to contribute to a global increase in poverty.
The poorest will be directly affected by impacts on ecosystems
Besides higher agricultural prices, the poorest people will also be directly affected by climate change through its impacts on

BOX 2.2 Climate-driven livestock diseases can have high economic costs

Livestock plays a vital role in the economies of many developing countries. Globally it accounts for 40 percent of agricultural production, employs 1.3 billion people, and creates livelihoods for 1 billion of the world's poor. Livestock products provide one-third of human protein intake.
Climate change affects many of the environmental variables that can lead to livestock diseases--and climate-sensitive livestock diseases already have high economic impacts (via income losses), as well as costs to prevent and control disease outbreaks.

In Somalia, Rift Valley fever epidemics prevented 8.2 million small ruminants, 110,000 camels, and 57,000 cattle from being exported, corresponding to economic losses for the livestock industry estimated at $109 million in 1998­99 and $326 million in 2000­02. In Kenya, the annual cost of East Coast fever is estimated at $88.6 million; in Malawi, $2.6 million; in Tanzania, $133.9 million; and in Zambia, $8.8 million.

livelihood activities that fulfill subsistence and other needs. In the absence of functioning capital, labor, and land markets and with very few assets on hand, many poor rural households depend on access to ecosystems (Barbier 2010). They use them to produce or extract goods for self- consumption (like crops, timber, and fish) and to smooth income shocks. Climate change can add to the stress on ecosystems and reduce their ability to support livelihoods.
Many poor rural people depend on ecosystems for their base income and as safety nets. Many of them live in low- productivity and fragile ecosystems, making them highly vulnerable to climate risks, including natural disasters (see chapter 3). Data collected for a global comparative study of tropical and subtropical smallholder systems show that about 27 percent of the households included fall below the extreme

poverty line--most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa (Noack et al., forthcoming). Out of the 424 million people living in the African drylands, 23 percent (or 40 percent of the 240 million agriculture-dependent individuals) are estimated to be below the extreme poverty line (Cervigni and Morris 2015).
In these areas, ecosystem-based activities provide poor people with incomes from intensive ecosystem management (like crop cultivation and livestock) and from the extraction of noncultivated ecosystem goods (like timber, plants, animals, and fish). These ecosystembased incomes made up 55 to 75 percent of incomes in a cross-section of 58 sites representing smallholder systems, with 15 to 32 percent coming from forests or other noncultivated ecosystems (figure 2.9).4 Among these typically poor households, the wealthier households derive a slightly lower share of their income from ecosystems and have a lower dependence on subsistence-based

households that have little other means to secure subsistence needs.
These subsistence incomes from ecosystems help to keep a considerable share of rural people above the poverty line. If smallholding households in (sub)tropical forest landscapes could not complement their income through forests and other environmental resources and were unable to find alternative income sources, an additional 14 percent of all sampled households would fall below the extreme poverty line (figure 2.10). Besides providing goods that directly contribute to cash or subsistence incomes, ecosystems can also indirectly benefit poor people (box 2.3).
Poor households have strategies to deal with climate variability. During the survey years, the poorest households in (sub)tropical smallholder systems were not subject to more weather or other livelihood shocks (such as income, asset, or labor losses), despite living in more extreme climatic conditions (Angelsen and Dokken, forthcoming). In addition, only a few of those households that were exposed to weather anomalies or shocks experienced a decline in income. As the survey years did not cover any major extreme events, this finding suggests that rural households can manage at

BOX 2.3 The wider functions of ecosystems and biodiversity in rural livelihoods

Ecosystems and biodiversity can support humans through nonprovisioning services (such as regulating, supporting, and cultural services) that are of critical importance for poor people in rural areas (MEA 2005). Studies that assess the links between such nonprovisioning ecosystem services and poverty have been very rare (Roe et al. 2014; Suich, Howe, and Mace 2015).
Ecosystem services can support incomes and livelihood activities in many indirect and often invisible ways. For instance, the establishment of a protected area in Costa Rica has increased tourismbased incomes and accounted for two-thirds of the poverty reduction achieved in the area (Ferraro and Hanauer 2014). Forests provide pollination services that benefit nearby farming activities (Olschewski et al. 2006; Ricketts et al. 2004). And intact water-

sheds support hydrological services that benefit local water supply for domestic use or agricultural activities (Klemick 2011; Pattanayak 2004).
In addition, ecosystems provide an important role in protecting livelihoods against climate risks. Trees on steep slopes protect rural villages from landslides when heavy rains fall, and mangroves provide protection to coastal livelihoods during storm surges (Badola and Hussain 2005; Das and Vincent 2009). Moreover, ecosystems can contribute to climate stabilization. For example, higher forest cover helps reduce the occurrence of droughts (Bagley et al. 2013; Davidson et al. 2012)
A new research agenda is emerging to better understand the services provided by ecosystems and who benefits from them (Bennett et al. 2012).

least modest weather and livelihood shocks without falling deeper into poverty.
One way to smooth income volatility is by extracting ecosystem resources. Incomes from resource stocks that grow continuously over years (like timber and fish) are less sensitive to weather fluctuations than those that depend on annual cycles (like crops). Hence forest resources can help smooth consumption between seasons and years (Locatelli, Pramova, and Russell 2012). Although environmental extraction was the primary coping strategy for only one out of 12 households in (sub)tropical smallholder systems, forest incomes are a substitute for agricultural incomes and can stabilize total income when weather anomalies hit (Noack et al., forthcoming).
As rural households are used to dealing with climate variability, weather anomalies are probably not perceived as shocks that require emergency responses, but as tacit changes in production conditions that require marginal adjustments of existing strategies. Thus, in India, households that have lower than predicted income, indicating a bad year, derive a higher income share from environmental resources (Damania

et al. 2015). Unfortunately, such responses, as well as the general overextraction and overuse of ecosystems resources, can lead to increasing degradation of ecosystems, which undermines the sustainability of such strategies.
Climate change adds to the stress on ecosystems and undermines rural livelihoods. Despite the importance of ecosystems for poor people, the link between climateinduced ecosystem changes and poverty has not been systematically assessed. This is due in part to the difficulty in disentangling ecosystem changes driven by climate change from those driven by other factors. The existing peer-reviewed literature suggests that the ecosystem-related impacts of climate change will affect poor people mostly through hazard regulation, soil and water regulation in low elevation coastal zones, and dryland margins (Howe et al. 2013). In many regions, there are a number of risks that are relevant for the rural poor--such as local warming in the Sub-Saharan drylands, which can trigger shorter growing seasons and shifts in areas suitable for rain-fed agriculture (table 2.1). Moreover, although current knowledge does not allow for a

quantification of these impacts, studies suggest severe livelihood impacts:
· Climate-related events have been shown to threaten livelihoods of poor people in a variety of rural contexts--such as precipitation variability in the Peruvian Andes (Sietz, Choque, and Lüdeke 2011); floods in Senegal (Tschakert 2007); drought in the West African Sahel (Sissoko et al. 2010) and in Northwest China (Li et al. 2013); and cyclone-related saltwater intrusion in coastal Bangladesh (Rabbani, Rahman, and Mainuddin 2013).
· Poor people can also be indirectly affected when climate change affects ecosystems that support their livelihoods, such as coastal and near-shore habitats (like wetlands, mangroves, coral and oyster reefs, and sea grasses) (Barbier, forthcoming). In Bangladesh, increased salinity linked to sea level rise reduced the suitability of land for rice farming (Dasgupta et al. 2014). In one Bangladeshi site, 70 percent of farmers partially or fully abandoned agriculture because of saline soils over a period of 10 years (Shameem, Momtaz, and Rauscher 2014).
· In the most extreme form of livelihood impacts, climate change could make ecosystems completely inhabitable, forcing out inhabitants--notably in small island states, some of which are at risk of disappearing before the end of the century (Burkett 2011). The low-lying Sunderbans, a coastal area between India and Bangladesh, are becoming a more difficult place to live for its mostly poor population, increasingly exposed to sea level rise, salinization of soil and water, cyclonic storms, and flooding (World Bank 2014a).
Conflict over environmental resources may exacerbate existing vulnerabilities of poor people. In Latin America, climate change and environmental degradation, along with the rapid growth of mining, could lead to greater competition for land and water resources. Smallholding farmers, indigenous communities, and other poor

rural people are the most vulnerable because of their reliance on traditional systems built on ecosystems resources and their exclusion from formal policy making (Hoffman and Grigera 2013; Kronik and Verner 2010). In the high Andes, indigenous farmers face institutional marginalization and land scarcity compounded by delayed rainfalls, which lead to disputes over access to water and land (McDowell and Hess 2012). Similarly, after the 1998 floods, herders in northern Kenya tried to recover herd losses by raiding neighboring farms (Little, Mahmoud, and Coppock 2001).
Policies can avoid negative consumption effects and increase incomes
While climate change is quite likely to hurt agricultural yields and raise food prices, resulting negative impacts on poor people can be offset, at least partially, through socioeconomic development, better infrastructure and markets, improved farm practices and technological progress, and the preservation and strengthening of ecosystems. As for land-based mitigation policies, they can be designed to be pro-poor.
Negative impacts on food security can be reduced by development and poverty reduction
Food insecurity will be determined not only by yield declines but also by the socioeconomic conditions that make countries better prepared to respond to and adapt to such declines. Biewald et al. (Forthcoming) created a hunger vulnerability index, based on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) from von Grebmer et al. (2011).5 This index represents in particular the fact that, as people get richer, they have better access to food markets and can buy their food instead of producing it. By 2030, development and increasing incomes reduce vulnerability to hunger in both the prosperity and poverty scenarios, with much greater progress in

6 6  S H O C K W A V E S

the prosperity scenario, thanks to its rapid reduction in poverty.
Socioeconomic vulnerability to hunger combined with climate-induced yield declines create potential food insecurity by 2030, especially in the poverty scenario. Map 2.1 shows where yields are expected to decrease, suggesting a reduced ability to produce locally, and where a high level of poverty may make it challenging to rely on food markets and imports. Most of the hotspots are in SubSaharan Africa. For example, most of Madagascar, Sudan, and Yemen suffer alarmingly high levels of yield decline and socioeconomic vulnerability to hunger in the poverty scenario. Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo experience high socioeconomic vulnerability to hunger but only

Source: Biewald et al., forthcoming. Note: Risk to food security is indicated by the combination of potential yield declines and hunger vulnerability in a Poverty (upper panel) and Prosperity scenario (lower panel). Lighter colors indicate lower risks and darker colors represent higher risks. Results for yield decline are based on the LundPotsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) model and results for hunger vulnerability are based on the spatial Vulnerability-to-Hunger Index (VHI) adapted from von Grebmer et al. 2011. Yield decline results compare a scenario with climate change to a scenario without climate change. The legend values are as follows: EI = Extremely high impact: decline of 10 percent or more, HI = High Impact: -10 to -2 percent, SI = Strong Impact: -2 to 0 percent; NNI = no negative impact: >0 percent. The Hunger Vulnerability index ranks spatial units on a 100-point scale. Zero is the best score (no hunger), and 100 is the worst: EA = Extremely alarming: 30, A = Alarming: 20 to 29.9, S = Serious: 10 to 19.9, LM = Low to moderate: below 9.9.

limited yield declines until 2030, while the opposite is true in the Middle East and North Africa. In India, where yield declines are modest, the socioeconomic vulnerability to hunger is serious in the poverty scenario, but decreases in parts of the country to moderate levels in the prosperity scenario.
The implication then is that development and poverty reduction can prevent some of the worst impacts of climate change on food security but do not replace targeted interventions to increase the resilience of the food production and distribution system.
Better infrastructure and market access help cope with production shocks
As observed during the 2010 food price crisis, countries where global price increases are matched by high rises in local prices also experienced higher poverty increases (Ivanic, Martin, and Zaman 2012). Countries can insulate domestic markets from global prices by reducing import protection or increasing export restraints. But by doing so they both increase average domestic food prices and contribute to global volatility--for example, export bans, such as those imposed by a number of large exporters in 2008, reduced availability on international markets and contributed to higher prices (Anderson, Ivanic, and Martin 2013).
Well-functioning markets can help countries cope with production shocks, although the ability to rely on markets depends on many socioeconomic conditions--especially institutional barriers (like trade barriers) and transportation costs. Rural road development offers a strong potential to lower transport costs and spur market activity. In Ethiopia the incidence of poverty decreased by 6.7 percent after farmers gained access to all-weather roads (Dercon et al. 2009).
A productivity shock at the local level can lead to much greater price fluctuations if local markets are isolated. For example, a recent study examines the statistical effect of road quality and distance from urban consumption centers on maize price volatility in Burkina Faso (Ndiaye, Maitre d'Hôtel, and Le Cotty 2015).

B ad S eed : C limate C hange , A gric u lt u re , and F ood S ec u rit y  6 7

It finds that maize price volatility is greatest in remote markets, suggesting that enhancing road infrastructure would strengthen the links between rural markets and major consumption centers, thereby also stabilizing maize prices in the region.
In addition, between 2006 and 2008, low food stocks may have exacerbated food price volatility (Gilbert and Morgan 2010), although an empirical analysis only confirms this effect for wheat since 2000. The absence of impact for other crops suggests that food stocks alone do not have a direct impact on price volatility but can amplify the effects of other factors (Tadesse et al. 2014). But while adequate food stocks can help to reduce price volatility and food insecurity, they can be costly and difficult to manage. And building food stocks can lead to increased grain scarcity and thus even higher prices in the short run. In the case of a large importing region-- the Middle East and North Africa--one study shows that a strategic storage policy at the regional level could smooth global prices but is much more costly than a social protection policy that dampens the effects of price

increases on consumers, like food stamps (Larson et al. 2013).
Thus, one solution appears to lie in coordinating measures aimed at limiting price volatility with actions to make farm practices more resilient. Together, these actions can significantly mitigate the impact of a shock, as occurred in Bangladesh in 1998 (box 2.4). Countries can also implement social protection schemes to ensure that vulnerable people are protected against food price volatility (see chapter 5).
Improved farm practices and technologies can mediate negative impacts
Climate-smart agricultural practices can increase productivity and make agricultural production more resilient. In countries most exposed to climate variability and change, disaster preparedness and resilient and diverse farming systems go hand in hand (World Bank 2011). For instance, Vietnam is improving its water resource management to make its cropping and aquaculture regimes

BOX 2.4 Mitigating losses from the 1998 flood in Bangladesh

The large-scale floods that hit Bangladesh in 1998 had the potential to cause a major food security disaster, but short-term and long-term policies played key roles in preventing such a disaster. Starting in the 1980s, public sector investment in agricultural research and extension, combined with private sector investments in small-scale irrigation, substantially increased yields of wheat and boro rice. These investments reduced vulnerability to floods by increasing total food grain production, reducing the length of time between major crops from 12 months to 6, and shifting away from flood-susceptible cultivation practices.
Furthermore, long-term investments in public infrastructure (including roads, bridges, electricity, and telecommunications) made agricultural markets more efficient and enabled traded grains to reach markets throughout the country after the floods.

In addition to infrastructure, government policies encouraged private-sector participation in the grain market. In the early 1990s, the liberalization of rice and wheat imports enabled private sector imports to quickly supply domestic markets and stabilize prices following the floods. Other policies--such as the removal of the import tariff on rice in 1998 and better port clearance of private sector food grain imports--also provided clear signals of government support for the private grain trade. These private sector imports proved a far less costly way of maintaining food grain availability than the distribution of government commercial imports or public stocks. And the inclusion of the private sector in general greatly increased food supply and stabilized food prices in the aftermath of the shock.

better adapted to increasing flood risk and salinity levels. But more productive and more resilient practices require a more efficient use of land, water, soil nutrients, and genetic resources (FAO 2013).
Better technologies will also be needed to tackle future food security challenges (FAO, IFAD, and WFP 2014). These might include improvements in crop varieties, smarter use of inputs, methods to strengthen crop resistance to pests and diseases, and reduction of postharvest losses (Beddington 2010; Tilman et al. 2011). Improved crops and better use of water and soil can increase both farmers' incomes and their resilience to climate shocks (figure 2.11).
One key way to make agricultural systems more climate resilient is by developing and adopting higher yielding and more climateresistant crop varieties and livestock breeds (Tester and Langridge 2010). In a randomized control trial in Orissa, India, a recent study shows the benefits of using a new, flood-resistant variety of rice, which offers a 45 percent yield gain relative to the current most popular variety (de Janvry 2015). After a first good experience, these varieties motivated farmers to take more risks and adopt more profitable techniques.
But the overall potential of technology to increase resilience remains uncertain.

Although many studies have shown that technological progress can limit climate change impacts on yields and food production costs (see figure 2.12), they usually assume sustained and very rapid yield gain, at odds with past yield trends. Empirical evidence reveals plateaus or even abrupt decreases in the rate of yield gain--for rice in eastern Asia and wheat in northwestern Europe (Grassini, Eskridge, and Cassman 2013). Further, another study points to a general decrease in the growth rate of yields for maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans at a global level, although with more optimistic trends in poorer countries (Alston, Beddow, and Pardey 2010). The low and declining levels of investment in agricultural research and development in the developing world can be a major constraint to realize further yield gains in poor countries (Pardey, Alston, and Chan-Kang 2013; Pardey and Pingali 2010).

Food production costs used in MAgPIE account for all costs, including infrastructure (irrigation systems) and research, and thus can differ from the prices faced by consumers. Slow, medium, and fast in the legend refer to the speed of technological progress, which is assumed to translate directly into increase in yields.

Moreover, disseminating improved technologies and making them accessible to poor farmers will be critical for the gains from such technologies to materialize. Adoption of new technological packages is often slow and limited (box 2.5). Such technologies can be costly or difficult to access. For instance, in Africa, fertilizer application remains low because of high transport costs and poor distribution systems (Gilbert 2012). Furthermore, cultural barriers, lack of information and education, and implementation costs need to be overcome. Agricultural extension services can help to make better use of new technologies. In Uganda, extension visits coupled with the introduction of new crop varieties increased household agricultural income by around 16 percent (Hill and Mejia-Mantilla 2015). Secure tenure rights, smart subsidies, and access to long-term finance can also provide farmers with incentives to adopt climatesmart technologies and practices (World Bank 2012).
Conservation and ecosystem-based adaptation increase the resilience of ecosystems
The vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change impacts will also depend on nonclimate human-made impacts. For example,

in the Amazon, self-amplifying feedbacks between reduced forest cover and extreme droughts resulting from a combination of global warming and forest cover loss puts the forest at risk for large-scale dieback (World Bank 2014c). Similarly, fishingdependent countries in South and East Asia (such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines Sri Lanka, and Vietnam), where fishing activities are poorly regulated, are very vulnerable to the combined impact of climate change and overexploitation (Barange et al. 2014).
This interdependence means that reducing nonclimate stresses on ecosystems can make them better able to adapt to climate change and continue to support livelihoods. Consequently, any measures that reduce or avoid land or forest degradation, depletion of natural resource stocks (such as fish), or pollution of water and soils can protect the ecosystems poor people depend upon and increase their resilience to climate change.
Targeted measures to foster ecosystembased adaptation are a critical way to help ecosystems and poor people better prepare for climate change. They seek to strengthen ecosystem processes and services, as well as the human systems that maintain them, in order to make them more resilient to climate

BOX 2.5 Despite significant benefits, adoption rates of conservation agriculture remain limited

Technological packages, which have been successfully tested in demonstration fields, are available to help farmers better prepare for climate change. For instance, conservation agriculture has been promoted to address poor agricultural productivity and environmental degradation, particularly in semi-arid areas that are characterized by frequent droughts and dry spells (Giller et al. 2009; Kassam, Derpsch, and Friedrich 2014). Because of its potential to increase yields, reduce labor requirements, and improve soil fertility, it could be a powerful adaptation strategy (Kassam, Derpsch, and Friedrich 2014).

Nevertheless, despite these benefits, adoption is still uneven. In Brazil, millions of hectares are cultivated with conservation agriculture (Triplett and Dick 2008). But in Morocco, after two decades of demonstration, only 5,000 hectares are cultivated with these techniques--almost exclusively on large farms (ICARDA 2012). Low adoption rates are the case for most countries in the Middle East and North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the available evidence suggests virtually no uptake of conservation agriculture (Giller et al. 2009).

stress and other environmental degradation. Such approaches include better protection and management of natural habitat or vegetation, such as restoring and protecting mangroves and dunes in coastal areas; management of flood plains in larger river basins; managing forests sustainably through selective logging, forest buffers, and fire prevention; and farming systems that integrate natural vegetation through fallow systems or agroforestry (McKinnon and Hickey 2009). Many of these strategies also provide carbon sequestration benefits.
Land-mitigation policies can be designed to benefit local incomes
Land-mitigation policies can be designed to avoid--or at least minimize--harmful impacts on agricultural production and food security and poor people. Although calibrating general mitigation policies to local contexts or introducing complementary measures may increase the overall cost of mitigation (possibly because more efforts would be required in nonagricultural sectors), it could actually bring significant benefits in terms of improved local livelihoods and ecosystems.
Careful land use planning--such as using designated degraded or less-productive areas for storing and sequestrating carbon stocks-- could minimize negative impacts on food production and even result in more productive landscapes. Restoring degraded forestlands and landscapes, as called for by the 2014 New York Declaration on Forests,6 could yield net benefits in the general order of $170 billion per year from watershed protection, improved crop yields, and forest products if an area of 350 million hectares was restored by 2030 (NCE 2014). And most of the potential for energy crop production on degraded land is located in developing regions (Nijsen et al. 2012).
Adaptation and mitigation benefits can be reaped at the level of the plot (through reduced tillage), farm (soil terracing combined with tree management), and landscape (thanks to agroforestry and

silvopastoral systems) (Harvey et al. 2014; FAO 2013; World Bank 2011). For example, the inclusion of trees in the farming system dramatically increases the potential to store carbon, while increasing yields--as shown in Africa, where farmers who have adopted evergreen agriculture are reaping impressive productivity gains of up to 30 percent without the use of costly fertilizer (ICRAF 2012). In Ethiopia, the Humbo Assisted Natural Regeneration Project has helped restore 2,700 hectares of biodiverse native forest, which has boosted carbon sequestration benefits and income generation based on forest products.7 Improved tree coverage also reduced drought vulnerability (figure 2.13).
Some land-mitigation options can be implemented through payments for ecosystem services, which compensate land users for any forgone production benefits and provide them with financial incentives for preserving or increasing carbon stocks in soil or forests. More than 300 such payment schemes have been established worldwide to support carbon sequestration, biodiversity, watershed services, and landscape beauty (NCE 2014).
Even if trade-offs are likely to occur between social goals and project efficiency, many programs target poorer land users.

BOX 2.6 Securing local benefits from harnessing the forests to lower emissions

Increasing international attention and funding have been raised for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and for other land-related mitigation activities. At the 2010 Cancún meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), member countries agreed to establish an international mechanism, whereby developed countries would pay low-income and middleincome countries in the tropics for five types of forest-related mitigation activities, called REDD+: (i) reducing emissions from deforestation, (ii) reducing emissions from forest degradation, (iii) conservation of forest carbon stocks, (iv) sustainable management of forest, and (v) enhancement of forest carbon.
Concerns about negative social and environmental impacts--such as restricting access for local people to forests and harming biodiversity--led to the establishment of REDD+ ""safeguards"" within the UNFCCC decisions. These safeguards require countries to put procedures in place to ensure that social

and environmental risks are minimized and benefits enhanced (UN­REDD 2013a).
Fair benefit-sharing systems that allow poor people to receive direct (like monetary gains) and indirect benefits (like better governance infrastructure provision) from REDD+ play a key role in operationalizing safeguards (Brockhaus et al. 2014). A precondition for such benefit sharing is tenure security and clarity that ensure access to ecosystems and participation rights for local people, which has become a key element of many national policies (UN­REDD 2013b). Under the Terra Legal program, Brazil has started a formal process of recognizing indigenous lands and granting land titles to about 300,000 smallholders conditional on compliance with the Brazilian Forest Code (Duchelle et al. 2014). The number of studies that illustrate how REDD+ can increase benefits for poor people is rapidly growing (Groom and Palmer 2012; Berry, Harley, and Ryan 2013; Luttrell et al. 2013).

Brazil's Bolsa Floresta program offers a monthly payment to low-income households if they commit to zero deforestation and enroll their children in school. Guatemala offers forest incentive programs, which aim to support forestry activities by poor smallholders without land title. In Colombia and Nicaragua, mainly poor land users receive payment for ecosystem services (Pagiola, Rios, and Arcenas 2008 and 2010). In Costa Rica, payments for reducing deforestation go mainly to poor areas (Pfaff et al. 2007). If participation constraints (like a lack of land titles, high transaction costs, or poor connections to government institutions) can be overcome, such payments could be an important livelihood element for poor people (Bremer, Farley, and Lopez-Carr 2014; Jindal et al. 2013; Zbinden and Lee 2005).
In other cases, mitigation actions need to be accompanied by complementary measures. Promoting modern energy for cooking can reduce the use of traditional wood biomass--which contributes to emissions through forest degradation and poor

health--but often clean energy solutions are not affordable for poor people. Financing efficient cookstoves, introducing cash transfers, and enhancing social protection schemes can help to protect poor people against some of the negative impacts in the short term (chapter 5).
If done properly, land-based mitigation actions can create direct employment benefits for local people. Climate-smart agriculture practices, land restoration, selective logging, and forest protection are labor intensive and thus can provide jobs and revenues to poor rural households (see box 2.6). One study finds that over half of some 40 REDD+ projects reviewed provided benefits in terms of employment and incomes for local communities, although these benefits have been modest (Lawlor et al. 2013).
In conclusion
This chapter has shown how climate change can affect agricultural production systems with significant implications for food prices

7 2  S H O C K W A V E S

and food security. While these impacts may remain limited until 2030, they can become considerable in the longer term--especially in poorer regions. The only way to avoid this longer-term outcome is with mitigation policies that include agriculture, forestry, and other land uses, which are often the main sources of emissions in poor countries. But these policies must be designed in a way that avoids negative impacts, or that even benefits local production or incomes--or these policies risk adding pressure on food production and prices.
While increases in agricultural prices-- triggered by climate change impacts or mitigation policies--will hurt all consumers, poor nonagricultural and urban households will be hit the hardest. In rural areas, farmers and agricultural laborers will experience mixed impacts. On the one hand, production shocks result in a direct drop in incomes. On the other hand, over the longer term, higher prices and wages could increase earnings, although this effect is more likely to reduce the negative impacts than to reverse them, especially if impacts are large. As for the resulting impact on poverty, our calculations (discussed in chapter 6) suggest that, in almost all possible scenarios, the net effect of the agricultural impacts of climate change will be to increase global poverty.
At the same time, climate change can add to existing stresses on ecosystems, which could undermine subsistence production, a critical safety net for the rural poor. Although such impacts remain difficult to quantify, case studies from various contexts show that climate stress coupled with ecosystem degradation forces households to alter their livelihood strategies.
The bottom line is that long-term climate change trends are likely to affect agriculture and ecosystems, with severe consequences for poor people and their livelihoods. These threats will be further amplified by the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters, which will exacerbate production and price shocks in the short term, and could sharply increase poverty in the longer run-- the topic of the next chapter.

Notes
1. These papers explore possible impacts in two socioeconomic scenarios: (i) a prosperity scenario (low population growth, high GDP growth, and low poverty and inequality) and (ii) a poverty scenario (high population growth, low GDP growth, and high poverty and inequality). See chapter 1 for a discussion of the scenarios and how they were chosen. The papers also explore possible impacts in two climate scenarios: (i) a low-emissions scenario (likely to result in a warming of 2°C by the end of the century compared to preindustrial levels with limited impacts) and (ii) a high-emissions scenario (likely to result in a warming of 4°C with high impacts). The low-emissions scenario is consistent with the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 of the IPCC, while the high- emissions scenario is based on the RCP8.5.
2. Impacts were calculated by comparing the agricultural price level (including crops and animal products) in the different emission scenarios--and thus with different magnitudes of climate change--with the prices that would occur without climate change.
3. In this model prices per tCO2 (ton of carbon dioxide) increase to between $17 and $84 in 2030 and are between $200 and $1,000 in 2080.
4. Based on the first globally comparable data from 58 sites representing smallholder systems in (sub)tropical landscapes. These data over-represent sites with high forest cover and low population densities so that these numbers are not representative for all rural areas, but they provide an estimate for some of the most marginal environments.
5. The GHI is computed using three equally weighted indicators that are combined in one index, namely the proportion of people who are undernourished, the prevalence of underweight children younger than five, and the mortality rate of children younger than five. All three index components are expressed in percentages and weighted equally. Higher GHI values indicate more hunger; lower values indicate less.

3 Threat Multiplier: Climate Change, Disasters, and Poor People

Main Messages

· Natural disasters push people into poverty and prevent poor people from escaping poverty.
· An increase in natural hazards is already observed and will worsen in the next decades. Some events considered exceptional today will become frequent in the long term, threatening current living conditions.
· These changes in hazards will affect poor people and our ability to eradicate poverty. Because poor people are often more exposed to natural hazards than the rest of the population, and almost always lose a greater

share of their assets and income when hit by a disaster, natural disasters increase inequality and may contribute toward a decoupling of economic growth and poverty reduction. · There are many options to reduce risks for poor people; and, although none are easy to implement, they do help reduce poverty and make the population more resilient to climate change. Examples include risk-sensitive land use regulation, more and better infrastructure, better housing quality and formal land tenure, air-conditioning, financial inclusion, and early warning and evacuation.

Introduction
Across the globe, on top of stresses on agriculture and ecosystems, shocks from natural hazards--from droughts to floods and storms--are a major reason why people become and stay poor. Indeed, evidence suggests that disasters increase poverty (Karim and Noy 2014). Consider the following examples:

· In Peru over the 2003 to 2008 period, one extra disaster per year increased poverty rates by 16 to 23 percent at the provincial level (Glave, Fort, and Rosemberg 2008).
· At the municipal level in Mexico, floods and droughts increased poverty levels by 1.5 to 3.7 percent between 2000 and 2005 (Rodriguez-Oreggia et al. 2013).

8 0  S H O C K W A V E S

· In Bolivia, the poverty incidence rose 12 percent in Trinidad following the 2006 floods (Perez-De-Rada and Paz 2008).
· For coastal communities in the subdistrict of Shyamnagar in the southwest of Bangladesh, after Cyclone Aila hit in 2009, unemployment skyrocketed (from 11 to 60 percent between 2009 and 2010) and per capita income decreased sharply (from $15,000 before the storm to $10,000 after). The poverty headcount rate increased from 41 to 63 percent between 2009 and 2010 (Akter and Mallick 2013).
Moreover, recovery is not straightforward for poor people. After Ethiopia's 1984­85 famine, it took a decade on average for asset-poor households to bring livestock holdings back to prefamine levels (Dercon 2004). While a prolonged shock such as a drought can have longterm impacts, so too can temporary shocks on human capital and poverty (Rentschler 2013). In Mexico, once children have been taken out of school, even just for a temporary shock such as a flood, they are 30 percent less likely to proceed with their education compared to children who remain in school (de Janvry et al. 2006). Temporary spending adjustments by lowincome households can result in permanent shifts--at the expense of the child's human capital and future productivity.
Further, poor households exposed to uninsured weather risk have been shown to reduce investment in productive assets and select lowrisk, low-return activities, perpetuating poverty (Cole et al. 2013; Elbers, Gunning, and Kinsey 2007; Shenoy 2013). In terms of the impact of disaster risk on poverty, these ex ante impacts can dominate ex post impacts, that is, the losses caused by a disaster (Elbers, Gunning and Kinsey 2007). This link from natural hazard exposure to poverty may create a negative feedback loop, in which poor households have no choice but to settle in at-risk zones (with cheaper rents) and as a result face increased challenges to escaping poverty.
Natural disasters are thus one of the critical channels through which climate-sensitive events already affect, and can increasingly affect, the ability of poor people to escape

poverty. An increase in the frequency or intensity of natural disasters is expected because of climate change--which is likely to push more people into poverty and increase poverty headcounts. Another key channel, agriculture and ecosystems, was covered in chapter 2, and a third, health, will be explored in chapter 4.
How can we explain the specific impacts of natural hazards on poor people? And what policy options are available to reduce this vulnerability of poor people, especially in light of climate change? Keep in mind that we are referring to all climate-related natural disasters, regardless of whether they are caused by natural climate variability or man-made emissions, as the two are closely linked and call for integrated risk management strategies that account for climate change.
This chapter tries to shed light on these questions. It begins with a short review of how climate change will affect natural hazards globally, then explores how these changes will impact poor people and affect the evolution of poverty. It draws on results from original studies that investigate--for the first time at the global level--the exposure differential between poor and nonpoor people, looking at droughts, floods, and high temperature. It also reviews several case studies on past disasters, deriving insights on the greater exposure and vulnerability of poor people, along with policy options to reduce this vulnerability.
Our main message is that the measures and policies that could be mobilized to help poor people manage natural risks in a changing climate amount to ""good development,"" which would make sense even in the absence of climate change--with the important caveat that the design of such measures and policies needs to take into account climate change and the uncertainty it creates.
Climate change will worsen natural hazards in most regions of the world
The large-scale changes in temperature, precipitation, and other meteorological variables that models project as a result of

T hreat M u ltiplier : C limate C hange , D isasters , and P oor P eople 8 1

climate change suggest that all extreme events related to these variables (droughts, floods, heat waves, and cold spells) will be affected. These impacts have been reviewed in many studies recently, including in the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013) and in the three volumes of the Turn Down the Heat reports (World Bank 2015a). This section briefly reviews the changes in hazards to be expected.
Heat waves and cold spells. Climate change will not make all extremes worse in the future. Cold spells have serious consequences and are expected to decrease both in frequency and in intensity. However, it is almost certain that heat waves will become more frequent and intense in the future in most regions of the world. For instance, in North Africa, temperatures considered exceptional today (and that have significant harmful effects on ecosystem function and people's well-being) will become a new normal under a high-emissions (4°C) scenario (World Bank 2014) (map 3.1). In Europe, the summer 2003 heat wave, which led to more than 70,000 deaths, would become an ""average"" summer at the end of this century under a high-emissions scenario--meaning that by 2100, every other summer would be warmer than the 2003 one.
In many regions, such massive changes would threaten everyday living conditions-- like the ability to work outside or

in non-air-conditioned facilities during the summer. While no single heat wave or extreme event is ""caused"" by climate change, the effect of climate change on heat waves' frequency and intensity is already detectable and is growing over time (box 3.1).
Droughts. Water availability depends on more than just precipitation--seasonal cycles, snow packs, and evaporation rates also matter. Because of the variability in local changes in climate, the evolution of droughts will vary depending on location. Overall, however, droughts are likely to become more common-- and it is likely that in many locations where droughts already are an issue the situation will worsen (like the Mediterranean basin, Southeast Europe, North Africa, Southern Africa, Australia, South America, and Central America). A background paper for this report estimates that under a high-emissions scenario, the number of people exposed to droughts could increase by 9 to 17 percent in 2030 and 50 to 90 percent in 2080 (Winsemius et al., forthcoming). Even so, some regions that currently experience regular water stress (like East Africa) are expected to see an improvement in water resources (map 3.2).
Tropical and extratropical storms. With higher temperatures, atmospheric circulations are modified, influencing winds and storms globally. But tropical storms (present in the tropics, the strongest of which are referred to as hurricanes in the North Atlantic and typhoons in the Pacific) and extratropical

MAP 3.1 Continued high emissions will mean many more ""broiling"" summer months (Percentage of summer months with extreme temperatures by 2100, for a low-emissions (left) and high-emissions (right) scenario)

BOX 3.1 Climate change makes extreme weather events more likely or more intense

Granted, individual events can never be fully attributed to climate change--even the most dramatic events of recent years would have been possible in a climate with no human influence, simply due to the natural variability of the climate (Hulme 2014). But recent trends in extreme temperature and precipitation can now be linked with climate change.
One recent study estimates that about 75 percent of the moderate daily hot extremes over land and 18 percent of moderate daily precipitation extremes are already attributable to warming (Fischer and Knutti 2015). And the probability of the occurrence of the 2003 European heat wave is estimated to have been doubled by the human influence on climate (Stott, Stone, and Allen 2004). About half the analyses of extreme events in 2012 find some evidence that

human-caused climate change was a contributing factor, even though natural fluctuations also were key (Peterson et al. 2013). Heat waves, like the one that affected the U.S. midwest and northeast in July 2012, are now four times as likely because of climate change.
As for the current increase in disaster losses, they can be explained by socioeconomic evolutions-- especially by the increase in population and wealth located in coastal and other at-risk areas. While an impact of climate change on economic losses probably exists, for now it remains undetectable (IPCC 2012).
Given the close interplay between natural climate variability and man-made climate change, disaster risk management cannot be separated from climate change adaptation.

MAP 3.2 With unmitigated climate change, total days under drought conditions will increase by more than 20 percent in most regions (Change in the number of days under drought conditions by 2100 under a high-emissions scenario)
Source: Prudhomme et al. 2014. Notes: Drought days are defined as days during which the river runoff is below 10 percent of the 1976­2005 average. Regions in white are those that experience very low runoff today and in the future.

storms (present in the mid- to high-latitude regions) may be impacted differently.
For tropical storms, a best guess today is that their overall number may decrease, even as the most intense storms may become more frequent, especially in the North Atlantic (IPCC 2013; Knutson et al. 2010; Ranson et al. 2014). In addition, tropical cyclones may start affecting new regions that are likely to be less prepared and more vulnerable (Hallegatte 2007; Kossin, Emanuel, and Vecchi 2014). A review of 11 studies concludes that economic losses from tropical cyclones could increase from 9 to 417 percent by 2040, depending on the region and the methodology applied (Bouwer 2013).
For extratropical storms, there is little agreement on how they will evolve, although models suggest that their intensity will increase and their mean trajectory will shift toward higher latitudes (Ranson et al. 2014). A review of seven studies finds that economic losses from extratropical cyclones could increase from 11 to 120 percent by 2040, depending on region and methodology (Bouwer 2013). And these studies do not account for sea level rise, which could make

T hreat M u ltiplier : C limate C hange , D isasters , and P oor P eople 8 3

extratropical storms even more destructive (Hallegatte et al. 2013).
Coastal floods. Climate change will cause a global rise in sea level, with widespread consequences on coastal risks. This global rise combined with local mechanisms-- including changes in water currents and local geological dynamics--will increase land loss from erosion, water salinization, and flood risks from storm surges in most coastal areas (World Bank 2014). Coastal flood risks are already large, as illustrated by the disastrous consequences of Tropical Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh in 2007 or the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, and they will only increase over time (box 3.2). Multiple studies have shown how even a limited rise in sea level can significantly increase the likelihood of very destructive coastal floods (Jongman, Ward, and Aerts 2012; Wong et al. 2014).
Heavy precipitation and floods. As precipitation changes, so will river runoff--a development that may have large consequences on flood risk, with increases in some places and decreases in others. Averages are weak proxies for changes in risk, as extreme rainfall or river runoff can rise even in a region where average precipitation and runoff fall. Climate change is likely to exacerbate the most intense precipitation events (Min et al. 2011), with serious consequences for urban flash floods. Under a high-emissions scenario, the number of exposed people could increase by 4 to 15 percent by 2030 and 12 to 29 percent by 2080, according to a background paper for this report (Winsemius et al., forthcoming). Under current vulnerability levels, the total number of global fatalities may well double between now and 2080, based on the latest projections of climate change, population, and GDP (Jongman et al. 2015). Economic losses from river floods could increase by 7 to 124 percent by 2040, depending on the methodology applied and region considered (Bouwer 2013).
While climate change matters for the future of these hazards, nonclimate factors will also affect future risks. These include physical

changes (like land subsidence for coastal risk), socioeconomic changes (like higher population and wealth in at-risk areas), and disaster preparedness. These changes will have large impacts and are likely to dominate the effect of climate change on economic losses from natural hazards in the next few decades (Bouwer 2013; Hallegatte et al. 2013; Mendelsohn et al. 2012).
Poor people are often--but not always--more exposed to hazards
Areas at risk of natural hazards have always attracted people and investment. Globally, there is a trend toward increased risk-taking: from 1970 to 2010, the world population grew by 87 percent, while the population in flood plains increased by 114 percent and in cyclone-prone coastlines by 192 percent. Further, the GDP exposed to tropical cyclones increased from 3.6 percent to 4.3 percent of global GDP over the same period (UNISDR 2011). The same trends hold at the country-level (Jongman et al. 2014; Pielke et al. 2008).
At-risk areas may be more attractive--in spite of the risk--when they offer economic opportunities, public services or direct amenities, and higher productivity and incomes (Hallegatte 2012a). In some rural areas, proximity to water offers cheaper transport, and regular floods increase agricultural productivity (Loayza et al. 2012). People may settle in risky areas to benefit from opportunities with industries driven by exports in coastal areas (box 3.2). Agglomeration externalities may attract people to cities, even if cities are more exposed than rural areas and newcomers have no choice but to settle in risky places. In a background paper prepared for this report, households in flooded areas in Mumbai, India, report that they are aware of the flood risks but accept them because of the opportunities offered by the area (such as access to jobs, schools, health care facilities, and social networks) (Patankar, forthcoming).

BOX 3.2 Large coastal cities: Wealthier places at risk of floods

The world's 136 largest coastal cities are examples of relatively wealthier places with large flood risks. A World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study (Hallegatte et al. 2013) estimates that average global flood losses today are about $6 billion per year, despite existing flood defenses. Even though these cities host pockets of deep poverty in slums and informal settlements, they are usually wealthier than the rest of the country, thanks to a concentration of export-led industries and skilled services. But they are also hotspots for flood risks, with widely varying protection levels. While cities in rich countries have the largest levels of risk in absolute terms, cities in developing countries experience higher relative risk levels (in percentage of local GDP), largely driven by lower protection. As map B3.2.1 shows, the 20 cities with the highest relative risks are almost all located in developing countries, especially in South and Southeast Asia.
Current trends in urbanization and economic growth alone are expected to increase flood losses in these cities, from $6 billion per year today to $52b illion per year by 2050. Environmental

changes--climate change and land subsidence-- would make losses soar rapidly if present protection is not upgraded. Even a moderate sea level rise (20 cm) combined with subsidence would make it necessary to invest massively in protection to avoid losses that could otherwise quickly reach levels of more than $1trillion per year. Existing protection can rapidly prove ill-adapted to changing environmental conditions and generate very high risks, which are invisible until a disaster happens.
But even if adaptation investments (like higher dikes and seawalls) keep the probability of coastal floods constant, subsidence and sea level rise could increase global flood losses by 2050 to $60­63 billion per year. Further, since more population and assets would depend on protection, the consequences of a dike failure or of an event that exceeds protection design would become much higher. While better protection can reduce risk, it also raises the potential for largerscale disasters if protections fail or are o verwhelmed by an exceptional event--making it essential to develop early warning and evacuation systems, crisismanagement preparedness, and reconstruction plans (Hallegatte 2012b; Hallegatte et al. 2013).

MAP B3.2.1 Most cities with the highest relative coastal flood losses are in South and Southeast Asia (Average annual losses from coastal floods (relative to local GDP) in the 20 riskiest cities in the world)

Within a country or region, the attractiveness of risky places means that people living there need not be poorer than the rest of the population. For instance, urban dwellers are, on average, wealthier than their rural countrymen. Since many cities are more exposed to floods than are rural areas, the urban-rural divide may make poorer people less exposed to floods than the wealthier urban population. However, at a more local scale and especially in urban areas, land and housing markets often push poorer people to settle in riskier areas. Where markets factor in hazard risks, housing is cheaper where risk is higher. And, because poorer people have fewer financial resources to spend on housing and a generally lower willingness and ability to pay for safety, they are more likely to live in at-risk areas.
The bottom line is that the ""opportunity effect"" attracts both rich and poor people to risky areas, even though land markets push poor people into riskier areas within a city. Whether poor people are more or less exposed than nonpoor people is an empirical question on which so far there has been little research. That is why this report explores the differential exposure of poor and nonpoor people, drawing on national studies and local surveys.
One of our background papers examines poverty-specific exposure to floods and droughts in 52 countries (Winsemius et al., forthcoming). It provides new insights by assessing if and where poor people are more exposed, and how this may change with a changing climate. Using the same socioeconomic data, another background paper examines the exposure of poor people to extreme temperatures (Park et al., forthcoming).
To understand whether poor people are more exposed to floods, droughts, and extreme temperatures we need ""geo- referenced"" information (where people live, their income levels) and hazard maps--which have only recently become available at the global level and at high resolution (Ward et al. 2013 and Winsemius et al. 2013 for floods; Prudhomme et al. 2014 and Schewe et al. 2014 for drought). Our flood and

drought hazard data come from a global model (GLOFRIS), which produces gridded indicators of inundation depth (for flood, 1 km resolution) and water scarcity (for drought, 5 km resolution). For temperature, we use observed spatial data on the maximum monthly temperature for each grid cell (at the 1 km resolution) from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia, which provide gridded estimates of temperature extremes from 1960 onward.
This state-of-the-art hazard data were combined with spatially explicit poverty data using a global dataset of household surveys in 52 countries from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). These surveys contain data on each household's location and wealth status. By calculating the flood, drought, and temperature indicator at the household level, it is possible to examine whether and how this exposure is different for poor and nonpoor households. Poor people are defined as those in the lowest quintile of the population in terms of the ""wealth index"" provided in the surveys, which is a measure of the assets that a household owns.
Combining hazard and socioeconomic data, a poverty exposure bias can be used to measure whether poor people are more exposed to a hazard. For a given area, the poverty exposure bias is the share of poor people exposed to a hazard, divided by the share of the total population exposed, subtracted by 1. A positive bias means poor people are more exposed than average; a negative bias implies poor people are less exposed than average. With this definition in hand we ask whether poor people are more exposed to floods, droughts, and high temperatures within the 52 countries for which we have data.
Floods. For river floods at the countrylevel, we find mixed results as illustrated in map 3.3, panels a, b, and c, which show the poverty exposure bias for floods with a return period (or 10 percent annual probability of occurrence) of 10 years (other return periods show similar results). In Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia, no pattern emerges: some countries exhibit a positive bias (poor people

more exposed than average) and others exhibit no bias or a negative one (poor people less exposed than average). But in Africa, regional patterns appear. In the southwest, countries exhibit a strong overexposure of poor people, as do those with larger rivers in the west (like Benin, Cameroon, and Nigeria). Among the countries analyzed, about half (representing 60 percent of the analyzed population) live in countries where poor people are more exposed to floods than average.
What if we focus only on urban households? Land scarcity is more acute in urban areas (compared to rural areas), and thus might create a stronger incentive for poor people to settle in risky areas due to lower prices. The results for urban households demonstrate a clear difference between the exposure of poor and nonpoor people, as can be seen in panels d, e, and f of map 3.3. In most countries (about 73 percent of the analyzed population), poor urban households are more exposed to floods than the average urban population. There is no such pattern for rural households, suggesting that land scarcity is a driver of flood risk in urban areas. This phenomenon of high exposure to flood risk for poor urban dwellers is also found using micro-level data on household location and flood hazard in Mumbai, India (box 3.3).
Droughts. Results for droughts at the country level show a more prominent poverty exposure bias, as illustrated in map 3.4. In most Asian countries and in southern and eastern Africa, poor households are more exposed to droughts (the definition of drought here is based on surface flows only and does not include groundwater and artificial water storage). In western Africa, coastal countries (Benin, Cameroon, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo) exhibit a positive bias, with the exception of Niger. In Latin America, poor people appear underexposed in Bolivia and Peru, but overexposed in Colombia, Guyana, and Honduras. Importantly, a number of Sub-Saharan African countries show a positive poverty exposure bias for both droughts and floods. When examining the total population, the

BOX 3.3 In Mumbai, poor people are disproportionately exposed to floods

In July 2005, Mumbai experienced an unprecedented flood, causing 500 fatalities and direct economic damages of $2 billion (Ranger et al. 2011). The flood took a toll on low-income and marginalized people-- with their losses estimated at about $245 million, of which almost $235 million came from household asset losses and the rest from informal business losses (Hallegatte et al. 2010). While these impacts are large in and of themselves, they are likely an underestimate. Actual impacts on marginalized populations, especially health impacts and out-of-pocket expenditures, were probably much larger.
Are Mumbai's poor people more exposed than nonpoor people to current and future floods? To answer these questions we explore the exposure of poor and nonpoor people to similar floods in the Mithi River Basin flood zone, drawing on a city-level household survey (containing each household's location and income) and two flood maps (one based on today's climate and the other based on the climate projected in a high-emissions scenario by 2080), as illustrated in map B3.3.1.
Three results stand out. First, under both scenarios, households in lower-income levels are disproportionately exposed, with 75 percent of those exposed reporting a monthly income of 7,500 rupees or less (table B3.3.1)--and the richest households

almost completely absent from at-risk areas. Second, more households overall are likely to be exposed to flood risks under the climate change scenario. Third, the distribution of exposure across poor and nonpoor people is similar for both scenarios: additional exposure (of climate change) has the same distribution as current exposure.

poverty exposure bias is more evident: most people (85 percent of the analyzed population) live in places with an overexposure of poor people to droughts.
Temperatures. We find that poor people are often more exposed to higher temperatures: 37 out of 52 countries (representing 56 percent of the population) exhibit a positive bias (map 3.5). In Africa, most countries have a positive poverty exposure bias, with regional patterns similar to those found for floods and droughts, with the positive bias particularly strong in western Africa (Benin, Cameroon, and Nigeria) and southern Africa (Angola, Namibia, and Zambia). In Asia, the results for temperature are regionally consistent, with most countries exhibiting zero or negative bias; in Central America, results are again sporadic.
Also worrying is that many of the 37 countries that exhibit a poverty exposure bias for temperature are already hot. If we plot the poverty exposure bias against a country's average annual temperature from 1961 to 1999 (to represent average climate), we find that hotter countries have a higher exposure bias (figure 3.1, panel a). At the same time, cooler countries exhibit a smaller bias, and in some cool countries, a negative bias. This occurs because, in these cool countries, nonpoor people tend to settle in areas with higher temperatures because they are climatically more desirable.
The results for temperature suggest a sorting of the population into desirable and lessdesirable areas within a country, with wealthier households typically living in desirable areas and poorer households in less-desirable ones. This is investigated in Nigeria, one of the hottest countries in our sample. We run a regression to estimate a household's wealth index conditional on the hottest monthly temperature a household experiences. Including socioeconomic and climatic controls, we find a clear signal that poorer households within Nigeria tend to live in hotter (less desirable) areas (figure 3.1, panel b).
One problem with studies of exposure at the national scale is that they may miss

important mechanisms and small-scale differences, from one block to the next. Another way to examine whether poor people are more exposed to natural hazards is through in-depth case studies of actual past events, analyzing household survey data. While many studies of disaster impacts are available, only a few look at the exposure of poor and nonpoor people separately. We provide the first systematic review of their findings.
At the local scale, poor people seem much more likely to be affected by natural hazards. In Bangladesh, after Cyclone Aila hit in 2009, a postdisaster survey of 12 villages on the southwest coast finds that 25 percent of poor households in these villages were exposed to the cyclone while only 14 percent of nonpoor households were (Akter and Mallick 2013). In Vietnam, a similar pattern emerges for the Mekong Delta: 38 percent of the region's poor but only 29 percent of the region's nonpoor live in frequently flooded areas (Nguyen 2011).
However, this pattern is not universal. A postdisaster survey after the 1998 Great Flood in Bangladesh finds similar exposure: 75 percent of poor people and 71 percent of nonpoor people were affected (del Ninno et al. 2001). After the 2011 floods in Kenya, almost everyone in the Bunyala District was affected (Opondo 2013). In the Middle East and North Africa, a study of five countries finds that the percentage of households reporting being affected by a disaster in the last five years is high at 90 percent, but does not vary based on poverty status (Wodon et al. 2014). And in at least one documented case, poor people were less exposed: after Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras in 1998, more than 50 percent of nonpoor households were affected, but only 22 percent of poor households were (Carter et al. 2007).
Our conclusion is that most studies find that poor people are more exposed (figure 3.2). However, the relationship between poverty and disaster exposure is context specific and depends on the type of hazard, local geography, institutions, and other mechanisms.

Poor people lose relatively more to disasters when affected
Poor people are often--but not always-- more exposed to natural hazards. But what about vulnerability? Do poor people lose more as a result of a disaster?
Answering these questions is challenging because of data limitations. While global data are sufficient for examining exposure, they cannot provide an estimate of vulnerability since that also depends on asset portfolios and livelihoods. However, out of the 13 local case studies that examine exposure to a disaster by poverty status, five (on Bangladesh, Honduras, and Mumbai) also examine losses for poor and nonpoor people separately (calculated as income losses, asset losses, or both) and provide insight on the difference in vulnerability.
The results show that in absolute terms, wealthier people lose a larger amount of assets or income because of a flood or storm, which is expected as they have more assets and higher incomes. But in relative terms, poor people always lose more than nonpoor people from floods and storms (figure 3.3). It is these relative losses, rather than absolute numbers, that matter more for livelihoods and welfare.
In Bangladesh, one study surveyed 700 floodplain residents living without protection along the Meghna River (Brouwer et al. 2007). The authors collected data on the average flood damage experienced because of floods for households above and below the poverty line. In absolute terms, households above the poverty line lost more: $240 per year, compared to $191 for those below the line. However, poor people lost much more in relative terms: 42 percent of household income compared to 17 percent for nonpoor people.
In Honduras, following Hurricane Mitch in 1998, a study investigated losses across wealth quartiles based on a survey of 850 rural households (Carter et al. 2007). Affected households in the bottom quartile lost nearly three times as much in relative terms as other households: 31 percent of their assets for

reconstructing their homes (Patankar and Patwardhan, forthcoming). A survey of 1,168 households shows that, while nonpoor people had higher absolute losses, poor people lost more as a percentage of income, across all three loss categories (table 3.1). When combining income, asset, and repairs, the total losses from the event reached 85 percent of the average annual income of the poorest people. These impacts obstructed the ability of households to recover in the aftermath-- not least because the loss of assets meant many poor households found themselves unable to borrow or repay previous loans (Rentschler 2013).
Why is it that poor people lose relatively more? For asset loss, poor people hold lower-quality assets and keep the assets in a more vulnerable form. For income loss, poor people tend to be more dependent on lower- quality infrastructure and natural capital to earn an income. They also are vulnerable to food price rises, and women and children are especially vulnerable to health impacts. We review each in turn.

the poor compared to 11 percent for the nonpoor.
In Mumbai, the 2005 floods not only caused direct losses to households' assets but also meant that the inhabitants lost income and spent large amounts on repairing or

Poor people hold more vulnerable and lower-quality assets
The typical asset portfolio of a poor and a nonpoor person are very different. Poor people tend to have less diversified portfolios: they hold a larger percentage of their assets in material form and save ""in kind."" The first ""savings"" of poor urban dwellers are often through investments in their home, which are very vulnerable to floods (Moser 2007), while many rural poor use livestock as savings in spite of their vulnerability to droughts (Nkedianye et al. 2011). Nonpoor people, with higher financial access, are able to spatially diversify and save in financial institutions, and their savings are thus better protected from natural hazards.
In addition, the quality of assets owned by poor people is lower. Take for instance housing stock. Households living in slums or informal settlements made out of wood,

T hreat M u ltiplier : C limate C hange , D isasters , and P oor P eople 9 3

bamboo, and mud on steep slopes will suffer more damage compared to individuals in housing made out of stone or brick. In coastal communities in southwest Bangladesh, following Cyclone Aila, 76 percent of households in ""kacha"" houses (traditional homes built with mud and bamboo) reported structural damage--far above the 47 percent for those in ""pucca"" houses (built with concrete and wood). In terms of economic damage, the average for kacha houses, $400, was also well above the $133 for pucca ones. Further, households in kacha houses were significantly more likely to experience fatality or physical injury--on average, 0.28 people per kacha house were injured or killed from the cyclone, compared to 0.13 per pucca house.
Poor people depend on fragile infrastructure and are not well protected
Besides private income and asset losses, natural disasters cause significant disruption to public infrastructure. While all people, to some extent, depend on electricity, working roads, and running water to earn a living, poor people tend to be less able to protect themselves from the consequences of disruptions in infrastructure services. And poor people often rely on more fragile or undermaintained infrastructure--such as unpaved roads that are impractical during the rainy season, or drainage systems that are insufficient or clogged by solid waste.
Another important issue is how infrastructure investments are distributed spatially (Fay 2005; Olsson et al. 2014; Tschakert 2007). Too often, investments are directed toward relatively wealthier places, at the expense of poorer neighborhoods. This effect can amplify the exposure gap between poor and nonpoor households and generate pockets of high risk. Progress along this dimension requires appropriate governance mechanisms, including giving poor people a voice in investment decision-m aking processes (chapter 5). Poor households

sometimes spend a lot of time and effort lobbying local authorities to invest in their communities to provide basic infrastructure (such as roads, piped water, and sanitation) (Moser 2007, 85). Nevertheless, households with little social capital will be unable to ""invest"" in public goods and improve their quality of life.
In Mumbai, impacts from a lack of appropriate infrastructure can be pervasive (Patankar, forthcoming) (box 3.4). Many low-lying and reclaimed areas across the city get flooded, especially when heavy rains combine with high tide or storm surges, with the added difficulties due to unsanitary methods of solid waste and sewage disposal and problems with the drainage systems. After flooding, more than 75 percent of surveyed households report electrical disruptions, a lack of local transport and clean drinking water, and sewage and garbage in their homes--all of which magnified the impacts of floods (Patankar and Patwardhan, forthcoming). Although many people were affected, poor people were the ones with fewer options to cope with infrastructure damage.
Many poor people depend on agricultural and ecosystem incomes that are particularly vulnerable to hazards
Another source of vulnerability is the reliance on agricultural and ecosystem incomes.

Chapter 2 discussed the fact that poor people, especially in rural areas without functioning markets, are highly dependent on agricultural income and ecosystems, and are therefore vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on yields and ecosystems' health and functioning. Here we focus on how this dependency translates into a higher vulnerability to natural hazards.
Large-scale events can wreak havoc on natural capital. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis hit southwest Myanmar, killing an estimated 140,000 people, and recovery is still far from complete (World Bank 2015c). A major reason is the damage to embankments and streams from the cyclone, which resulted in a reinforcing chain of events for affected farmers. Erosion and destroyed embankments made fields more prone to flooding. Further, the duration of daily and monthly tides became longer after Nargis, making fields more saline and prone to pest infestation. Without funds for repair, affected farming villages became more prone to these external events--flooding, saline intrusion, and pest infestation. As a result, yields decreased, as did income. Households have attempted to borrow money but this has led only to more indebtedness.
Furthermore, natural capital often serves as a safety net after a disaster, when not depleted (Barbier 2010). In Bangladesh after Cyclone Aila hit in 2009, households living closest to the coast, while more exposed and vulnerable to the storm (and poorer), had a

BOX 3.4 Hidden costs of recurrent hazards for poor people in Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City

Large-scale events make the news, but repeated small adverse events such as regular floods often have serious implications for poor people, affecting their livelihoods and their ability to accumulate assets. To get a better sense of the ""hidden costs"" of such events, take the following two cases.
Recurrent floods in Mumbai. Mumbai is prone to recurrent floods during the monsoon season, with significant impacts on poor people (see a background paper for this report, Patankar, forthcoming). Based on the experience of recurrent floods, the authorities have identified 40 chronic flood spots (low-lying areas) and 200 localized flood spots (where waterlogging is due to inadequate drainage and poor land use planning). When we combined this spatial data with land use maps (Planning Department 2015), we found that land use in the flood-prone wards suggests an unplanned mix of residential, commercial, and industrial activities coexisting without clear zoning. As a result, recurrent floods expose a large number of residents, including those in the many low-income slum settlements, who report floodwaters entering their houses many times during the monsoon season.
A survey of 200 households yields two key insights. First, households regularly report problems with transport, drinking water, power supply, and food and fuel availability because of the floods.

One implication is that households lose workdays: on average 2.5 per year because of poor infrastructure (more than 50 percent cite unavailability of transport or flooded roads)--implying a loss of income and productivity and sometimes jobs. Second, almost 40 percent of households report someone in the family experienced health impacts from diarrhea yearly due to floods, with this figure rising to 64 percent for malaria and 86 percent for viral fever. Between 2001 and 2011, the number of reported cases of malaria has increased by 217 percent, mainly due to lack of sanitation in slums and water accumulation during the monsoon season (Public Health Department 2015).
Recurrent floods in Ho Chi Minh City. A survey of three flood-prone districts in Ho Chi Minh City finds health impacts to be pervasive (World Bank and Australian AID 2014). Regular floods in a heavily polluted environment have led to many a ilments-- including skin and intestinal diseases, rheumatism, bronchitis, and chronic coughing, especially among children under five. Every year, more than twothirds report that they are suffering from health issues, with more than half suffering from a waterborne (55 percent) or respiratory disease (52 percent) directly related to local flood conditions. These impacts also take a significant toll on employment and income, especially for poor people (table B3.4.1).

more resilient income because the proximity to mangrove reserves offered higher incomegeneration opportunities than for inland inhabitants (Akter and Mallick 2013). As stressed in chapter 2 and in a background

paper for this report (Noack et al., forthcoming), climate change impacts on these ecosystems may impair their ability to serve as a safety net and to smooth consumption in the face of shocks.

9 6  S H O C K W A V E S

Poor people are more vulnerable to rising food prices after a disaster
Another point that was made in chapter 2 is that poor people in developing countries spend on average between 40 and 60 percent of their household budget on food--far more than the 25 percent spent by nonpoor people. This makes them more vulnerable than the rest of the population to increases in food prices (although net food producers could gain, if they can maintain their production level). Here, we show that this vulnerability matters in postdisaster situations.
After tropical Storm Agatha struck Guatemala in 2010, per capita consumption fell 13 percent, raising poverty by 18 percent; in particular, food expenditures fell 10 percent, accounting for 40 percent of the total consumption drop (Baez et al. 2014). This stemmed from a major loss in food infrastructure and transport, resulting in a 17 p ercent increase in food prices 10 months after the storm. Agatha thus caused a logistical problem rather than a decline in domestic production, since it occurred in the middle of the first planting season, at a benign time with respect to local agricultural cycles.
Natural disasters can also result in food price spikes as a result of supply shocks. Disasters can destroy crops and seed reserves, destroying productive assets in agricultural communities and sparking food price shocks, as occurred after the unprecedented 2010 floods in Pakistan (Cheema et al. 2015). The floods destroyed 2.1 million hectares of

agricultural land, decimating production and sending prices of wheat upward of 50 percent above the preflood level.
How does poverty fit into the picture? In Bangladesh, after the 1998 Great Flood, a study shows that consumption levels differed based on exposure and poverty status (del Ninno et al. 2001). There was no difference in calorie consumption between exposed and nonexposed households in the top quintile, but in the bottom quintile the difference was 11 percent. For those exposed, bottom- quintile households on average consumed 1,400 calories per capita, and 80 percent fell below the minimum daily caloric requirement of 1,800; however, the average calories consumed for exposed top-quintile households remained above 3,000. In addition, two-thirds of bottom-quintile households spent more than 70 percent of their budget on food. As a result, 48 percent of the households in the poorest quintile were deemed food insecure after the flood, compared to an average of 16 percent across all quintiles (table 3.2).
Children are particularly vulnerable to indirect impacts through health and education
Building human capital through better health and education is a vital component of escaping poverty, but natural disasters can worsen health and education outcomes, especially for children (chapter 1).

There are acute health effects on children from the direct impact of disasters and lower postdisaster consumption, especially after droughts. In Ho Chi Minh City, in the Thanh Xuan Ward of District 12, a majority of children experience fevers, coughing, and flu during a high-tide period (World Bank and Australian AID 2014; and box 3.4). Following weather shocks in Sub-Saharan Africa, asset-poor households provide children with lower-quality nutrition and are less likely to take sick children for medical consultations, with long-term impacts on child development and prospects (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006; Dercon and Porter 2014; Jensen 2000; Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005).
Impacts on education are also prevalent. In Africa, children affected by droughts are less likely to complete primary school (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006; Dercon and Porter 2014), and similar impacts have been found in Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere (Baez, de la Fuente, and Santos 2010; Maccini and Yang 2009).
Moreover, women are particularly vulnerable as they often take greater responsibility for household chores, increasing their hardships during floods. This is in addition to time taken off work (sometimes for a couple of months) to care for children who become sick because of living in flood conditions, which can be especially punitive for factory workers. Women also spend more time at home to clean after a flood, making them more likely to contract waterborne diseases.
The reasons why poor people are more at risk point to possible policy solutions
So, if poor people are disproportionately affected by disasters--and here the evidence is compelling--what can be done to make them less exposed or vulnerable? This section builds on the insights of the previous one to identify six examples of policies that

could improve the resilience of poor people. The benefits of these actions could be significant, even without man-made climate change. An increase in the frequency or intensity of natural hazards due to climate change would make these benefits even larger, provided that policies and measures are designed to account for climate change and the uncertainty it creates.

A major reason why poor people often live in riskier areas is cheaper housing. In Ho Chi Minh City, qualitative surveys suggest flooded areas can be much cheaper than nonflooded areas for the same quality of accommodation (World Bank and Australian AID 2014). In addition, recent experience of a flood can reduce housing prices by around 9 percent (Husby and Hofkes 2015).1
In developing countries with informal markets, land scarcity can be particularly acute and land markets function poorly (DurandLasserve, Selod, and Durand-Lasserve 2013). In these places, it may not be the prices that push poor people into risky places, but simply the availability of land with appropriate access to jobs and services. Informal settlements are often located in hazard-prone locations, such as on hill slopes, close to riverbanks, or near open drains and sewers, as in Pune, Dhaka, Caracas, Rio de Janeiro, and Mumbai (Lall and Deichmann 2012; Lall, Lundberg, and Shalizi 2008; World Bank 2007).
Land use regulations can help by ensuring that new development occurs in places that are safe or easy and cheap to protect. They can also avoid unchecked urban development that leaves too little porous green space and further increases runoff and flood risk (Lall and Deichmann 2012). But doing so remains challenging for a number of reasons.
First, countries need appropriate data on risk and hazard to identify places that are too risky to develop, or where development is possible provided that buildings and

9 8  S H O C K W A V E S

infrastructure are built following strict rules. Unfortunately, access to risk information still varies greatly and is quite limited in lowincome environments. To address this issue, the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) are investing in risk information. The GFDRR's Open Data for Resilience Initiative supports the creation of GeoNode, a webbased open source platform that makes it easier to develop, share, manage, and publish geospatial data (www.geonode.org). Such initiatives can make a difference locally, by making risk information freely available not only to professionals but also to the public.
Second, countries need strong institutions that can ensure that land use plans are actually enforced. In most of the world today, risk-sensitive land use plans face strong political economy obstacles, and are only rarely enforced (World Bank 2013, chapter 2). One of the main obstacles is the asymmetry between the costs and benefits of risk-s ensitive land use planning. The costs of flood zoning are immediate, visible, and concentrated, in the form of reduced land values for landowners and higher housing costs for tenants (Viguie and Hallegatte 2012). In contrast, the benefits occur through avoided losses--which nobody can see--sometimes in the future, and go to unknown people. In such a context, the opponents to flood zoning are usually vocal and well organized while beneficiaries are absent, making the policies difficult to pass and enforce.
Third, countries need to design land use plans in a way that accounts for the reasons why people decide to live in risky places-- primarily, access to jobs and services. When asked what it would take to consider relocating to a safer, less flood-prone area, 44 percent of households in Mumbai cited transport, along with the availability of health services, schools, and social networks (Patankar, forthcoming). In Ho Chi Minh City, local and migrant households do not have any plans to move despite high flood risk and health impacts (World Bank and Australian AID 2014). The reasons, according to most of the 246 survey respondents,

are the considerably cheaper rents in risky areas and proximity to work (usually in factories) for late return at night. Thus, to be effective, flood zoning should be accompanied by investment in transport infrastructure to make it possible for people to settle in safe places while maintaining access to the same (or comparable) jobs and services.
Fourth, countries need to remember that land use regulations can have unintended consequences, particularly for poor people. Restrictive flood zoning policies can increase housing costs, making it more difficult for rural poor people to move to cities and capture the opportunities of an urban life (like better-paying jobs and better health care and education). Restrictive policies can also worsen risks. In Mumbai, because of strict regulations, buildings have been held to between a fifth and a tenth of the number of floors allowed in other major cities (Lall and Deichmann 2012). The resulting low-rise topography contributes to land scarcity, higher housing prices, and slum formation, including in flood zones.
More resilient infrastructure and protection systems that serve poor people
Poor people suffer from frequent disasters because they lack the type of protective infrastructure that is common in wealthier countries. As described in box 3.2, lower protection levels are the main reason why flood risks are higher in relative terms in poor than in rich coastal cities (Hallegatte et al. 2013). And the difference is even more obvious within cities: for instance, poor households are often exposed to recurrent floods because of the lack of infrastructure, or its poor condition, especially drainage systems (box 3.4). Solving this problem requires investing more and investing better.
Investing more. Governments in both developed and developing countries already struggle to finance infrastructure. Millions of people in developing countries still lack access to safe water, improved sanitation, electricity,

T hreat M u ltiplier : C limate C hange , D isasters , and P oor P eople 9 9

and transport. Even disregarding climate concerns, developing countries need substantially more infrastructure to grow and address poverty, inequality, and unemployment concerns.
Little data exist on how much is being spent on infrastructure, but the World Bank Group estimates that at least $1 trillion per year would be needed in developing countries to close the infrastructure gap, with about $100 billion for Africa alone.
This lack of infrastructure is an obvious multiplier of natural hazard consequences, and one that could be closed through increased investments. But infrastructure does not attract enough capital, especially in developing countries: long-term, largely illiquid investments are not perceived as attractive destinations for global capital. Many countries are simply too poor to generate domestically the needed pool of savings. Many others lack local capital markets that are sufficiently developed to transform local liquidity into the patient capital that is needed for longer-term investments. Further, public spending is limited by a low tax base (10­20 percent of GDP in many countries) and low debt ceilings.
Recommendations typically include leveraging private resources to make the most of available capital, which involves well-known steps like improving the investment climate (making sure regulations are clear and predictable and the rule of law and property rights are enforced), developing local capital markets, and providing a pipeline of ""bankable"" projects (Fay et al. 2015). Official development assistance (ODA) can play a catalytic role in mobilizing additional resources, but it is constrained by donors' fiscal constraints and remains limited relative to overall needs--at its highest around 2011, it reached about $90 billion.
Investing better. New and additional investments will reduce the long-term vulnerability of the population--and especially the poorest--only if new infrastructure is designed so that it can absorb climate change and remain efficient in spite of changes in climate and environmental conditions.

The challenge of addressing the long-term risks from climate change in development projects is multifaceted. First, there is high uncertainty as to how global climate change will translate into local changes in environmental conditions, especially for extreme events. Second, climate change is often an exacerbating factor of other development stressors (such as poverty, urbanization, water degradation, increasing population, resource use, and existing natural hazards). Third, if investment in disaster risk reduction or climate adaptation is designed to maximize economic returns, it will be concentrated toward areas with highest asset values--that is, toward wealthier groups (Füssel 2012; Tschakert, forthcoming).
Fortunately, there are innovative ways to manage the long-term, uncertain risks of climate. These approaches seek to identify robust decisions (those that satisfy decision makers' multiple objectives in many plausible futures and over multiple time frames) rather than being optimal in any single best estimate of the future (Bonzanigo and Kalra 2014; Kalra et al. 2014; Lempert et al. 2013). Decision making under uncertainty starts with the options available--from infrastructure to early warning systems--and does not attempt to predict the most likely future(s). The performance of each option is then tested against many different possible future conditions to identify its vulnerabilities. Those future conditions include climate, political, and socioeconomic risks.
At that point, it becomes possible to evaluate the trade-offs among the different options (using different measures of success, like economic return, number of people benefiting, whether poor or nonpoor people are the main beneficiaries) and to identify policies that reduce the vulnerability of future investments. Often, these methods favor soft and flexible options over hard ones--including monitoring systems to make sure risks are systematically assessed throughout the life of the project, so that solutions can be adjusted over time. They also encourage decision makers to look beyond within-sector interventions, and combine prevention and reactive actions

BOX 3.5 In an uncertain future, developing into the wetlands of Colombo is dangerous

Colombo faces recurrent floods that largely affect low-income populations and threaten the city's longterm development. Its urban wetlands have been identified by local agencies as a critical component of its flood protection, but wetlands have declined rapidly in recent years because of continuous infilling, unmanaged development, and land dredging for lakes. In collaboration with government agencies, NGOs, and local universities, a World Bank analysis was conducted to examine the value of Colombo's urban wetlands in the short term and long term and to identify the most viable strategies available to increase the city's flood resilience in an uncertain future (in terms of climate change, urban development patterns, and the resilience of poor communities). This involved the use of numerous hydrological and socioeconomic scenarios as well as the evaluation of some wetlands benefits (such as ecosystem services for the populations who fish in the wetlands, wastewater treatment, or recreational services).

The analysis determined that, if all urban wetlands across the Colombo catchment were lost, in some scenarios the metropolitan area would have to cope with annual average flood losses of about 1 percent of Colombo's GDP in the near future, with significant impacts on the poorest populations--a level of risk considered unacceptable by local decision makers and stakeholders.
For long-term strategies, trade-offs between urban development, lake creation, and wetland conservation were weighed, with active management of urban wetlands emerging as the lowest regret option. The analysis also found that, faced with climate change and fast urban development, wetlands would not be sufficient to protect Colombo against severe floods. This means that proactive urban planning and land use management are essential to protect existing wetlands, provide incentives for vulnerable populations to move to safe areas, and reduce future exposure of people and assets.

within a consistent strategy. Projects following these methodologies that are being piloted by the World Bank include water supply in Lima, flood risk management in Ho Chi Minh City and Colombo (box 3.5), hydropower investment in Nepal, and road network resilience in Peru and across Africa.
Finally, better-designed infrastructure and public investment will translate into reduced vulnerability only if infrastructure designs are respected during the construction phase. Studies show that most of the deaths after earthquakes occur in countries with a high level of public sector corruption, where building norms are not enforced, and where public buildings are often not built according to the designed standards (Ambraseys and Bilhan 2011; Escaleras, Anbarci, and Register 2007). The same is likely true for climate-related disasters such as floods and storms, although data are not available.
The Global Program for Safer Schools, created by the World Bank and the GFDRR, aims at making school facilities and

the communities they serve more resilient to natural hazards, with a strong focus on the enforcement of building norms. It supports a safety diagnostic of schools in Lima, Peru, and provides technical assistance in Mozambique to optimize the delivery of resilient schools at the local level--targeting both government and community construction. Similar actions exist in other sectors. For example, the World Health Organization, the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and the World Bank partnered in 2008 in the ""Safe Hospitals"" initiative to help health facilities withstand natural shocks.
Improved property rights to incentivize resilience investments
One reason why poor people lose a larger share of their assets and income is that they live in buildings with low resistance to natural hazards. In Latin America, a 1993 inventory found 37 percent of its housing stock

provided inadequate protection against disaster and illness (Fay 2005). Since then, rising trends in urbanization, settlements in risky areas, and the low quality of those settlements have likely increased this share (Lall and Deichmann 2012).
In Mumbai, both poor and nonpoor households undertake short-term and recurrent measures to reduce the intensity of flooding in their premises (Patankar, forthcoming). This includes cleaning surroundings and gutters choked with garbage, repairing leaking roofs, overhauling vehicles, and house repairs. But the difference between poor and nonpoor is visible in the type of action undertaken (table 3.3). Poor people undertake repairs for roofs and houses in larger numbers than the nonpoor, because their houses are made of more vulnerable material. Such repairs have to be undertaken annually, are financed without much support from the government, and end up being more costly than building highquality roofs in the first place. These expenses place another financial burden on poor households.
The lack of clear and effectively enforced land and property rights discourages poor households from making more robust and durable--but also costlier--investments. Facing the permanent risk of eviction, they are unlikely to invest in the physical resilience of their homes (like retrofitting to strengthen homes against disasters) (Rentschler 2013). In Buenos Aires, the fear of eviction, along

with low levels of household income, is the main reason for underinvestment in housing infrastructure, according to a survey of two informal settlements without tenure security (van Gelder 2010). In contrast, in Tanzania, as figure 3.4 shows, households with home ownership (and especially those holding some form of documentation) invest significantly more in their dwelling (Rentschler 2013).
The lesson here is that better tenure security encourages investment in housing, including risk reduction. In Peru, starting in 1996, the government issued property titles to over 1.2 million urban households, which at the time was the largest titling program targeted at urban squatters in low-income countries. A study on the impact of this program on housing renovations found that households in program neighborhoods invested significantly more than those in nonprogram ones (Field 2007). In addition to better housing, access to services (water) rose, and crowding was reduced as households enlarged their homes and increased the number of rooms--thereby stimulating the rental market (Mosqueira 2003).
Efficient and sustainable air-conditioning to reduce vulnerability to extreme heat
In May 2015, a major heat wave swept across India, with temperatures hitting highs of 118°F (48°C) in some parts. Official statistics

reported more than 1,100 deaths (Al Jazeera 2015). Elderly people, as in most heat waves, were among the most vulnerable, along with low-income workers, employed outdoors, in jobs from rubbish collection to farming and construction. In the state of Andhra Pradesh, which experienced the greatest impacts from the heat wave, a majority of the 900 reported victims were elderly or low-income workers (Al Jazeera 2015; Vice News 2015). Homeless people, who are unable to find shelter, are also among the most vulnerable: according to a Delhi-based nongovernmental organization (NGO), of the 186 people who died in the capital, 80 percent were homeless (Vice News 2015). But these figures may underestimate the death toll, since reliable statistics are difficult to find (The Economist 2015).
In Chicago, a lack of air-conditioning was a critical risk factor for death after the 1995 heat wave, which resulted in over 700 deaths, concentrated among the poor and elderly populations (Whitman et al. 1997). People who did not have a working air conditioner, access to an air-conditioned lobby, or visited an airconditioned place were 20­30 percent more

likely to die compared to people with access to air-conditioning (Semenza et al. 1996). In fact, the strongest protective factor found was air-conditioning: more than 50 p ercent of the deaths related to the heat wave could have been prevented if each home had a working air conditioner. And a meta-analysis of heat wave studies finds working home air-c onditioning reduces the odds of death by 23 to 34 percent (Bouchama et al. 2007).
Thus, access to air-conditioning, which implies reliable electricity production and distribution, could be a critical tool to reduce health impacts from heat waves--but only if it reaches the most vulnerable segments of the population. In France, programs like the National Heat Wave Plan set up after the 2003 heat wave are designed to provide airconditioning shelters in community centers and in senior citizen homes to reach these populations. For those working outdoors, airconditioning is unlikely to help much. Thus, adaptations such as flexible work hours (like not working during direct sunlight) and shorter shifts may become necessary in more places.
One caveat is that increasing air-conditioning is likely to have a significant environmental cost. First, air-conditioning in buildings increases street temperatures, increasing the potential impact on homeless persons or those working outside. Second, air-conditioning consumes energy: stabilizing climate change will thus require that air-conditioning equipment be extremely efficient and electricity low carbon (zero carbon in the longer term). A recent study for Mexico tried to quantify the potential climate impacts from air- conditioning, drawing on household-level data (Davis and Gertler 2015). It finds that on hot days there is a large increase in electricity consumption: above temperatures of 21°C, usage increases nonlinearly; and, for every additional day above 32°C, usage rises by 3.2 percent.
The negative impacts of air-conditioning can be mitigated by additional measures. For instance, urban planning, improved housing quality, highly reflective materials for roads and buildings, and irrigated parks can

T hreat M u ltiplier : C limate C hange , D isasters , and P oor P eople 1 0 3

minimize heat waves and reduce energy demand for air-conditioning (Chapman et al. 2009; Masson et al. 2013 and 2014).
Improved financial inclusion and savings options
In most countries, poor people suffer from lower access to finance than nonpoor people (figure 3.5), often forcing them to save ""in kind."" Fortunately, in the past decade, an alternative method of extending banking services has developed: mobile money. Most adults in the world today--poor people included--have access to mobile phones: the United Nations estimates that out of 7.3 billion people, 6 billion have access to these devices. Mobile money accounts, by providing more convenient and affordable financial services, offer promise for reaching unbanked adults traditionally excluded from the formal financial system--such as women, poor people, young people, and those living in rural areas (Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2015). As such, the expansion of mobile money has the potential to improve parity in financial inclusion and to make the savings and asset portfolio of poor people less vulnerable to natural hazards. (For a fuller discussion on financial inclusion, see chapter 5).
Better observation systems, early warning, and evacuation planning
Early warning and disaster preparedness can save lives and reduce economic losses. Weather forecasts enable the anticipation of, and preparation for, extreme events.
The value of preparedness was illustrated when Cyclone Phailin made landfall in the State of Odisha, India, on October 12, 2013, around 9:15 pm with wind speeds of around 200 km/hour.2 The storm that hit the same coastline 14 years before, in 1999, Cyclone 05B, caused massive devastation, killing more than 10,000 people and destroying housing and public infrastructure in coastal Odisha. This time around, however, the story unfolded differently. After 72 hours, the official death toll was 38

people, less than 0.4 percent the death toll from the 1999 cyclone. Close to a million people were evacuated to cyclone shelters, safe houses, and locations inland in Odisha (around 850,000) and in Andhra Pradesh (around 150,000). This success was made possible by years of effort from the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA) and the government of Odisha-- thanks to planning, construction of disaster risk mitigation infrastructure, setting up of evacuation protocols, identification of potential safe buildings to house communities, and, most important, working with communities and local organizations to set up volunteer teams and local champions who knew what needed to be done when the time came to act.
Preparing a house before a hurricane (by shuttering windows, for example) can reduce damage by up to 50 percent (Williams 2002). After the Elbe and Danube floods in 2002, studies show that 31 percent of the population in flooded areas implemented preventive measures (Thieken et al. 2007; Kreibich et al. 2005). These measures included moving

1 0 4  S H O C K W A V E S

goods to the second floor of buildings, moving vehicles outside the flood zone, protecting important documents and valuables, disconnecting electricity and gas supplies and unplugging electric appliances, and installing water pumps. Warning timing was critical: businesses that protected their equipment or inventories were those that received the warning early enough. One study estimates that a warning emitted 48 hours before a flood enables the overall damage to be reduced by more than 50 percent (Carsell, Pingel, and Ford 2004).
Yet, in spite of these large benefits (Hallegatte 2012b), early warning and evacuation systems are still underdeveloped. In the

subdistrict of Shyamnagar in Bangladesh, only 15 percent of nonpoor people and 6 percent of poor people attend cyclone preparedness training (Akter and Mallick 2013). In the Lamjung district of Nepal, the penetration of early warning in flood and landslide-prone communities is lower than 1 percent (Gentle et al. 2014). In Mumbai, levels of early warning are also paltry, with only 10 percent of the surveyed households reporting receiving some form of early flood warning. These shortfalls highlight the challenges and the opportunities associated with building hydrometeorological institutions and systems that could produce actionable warnings (box 3.6) (Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013).

BOX 3.6 Reversing the degradation of hydrometeorological services

Over the past 15­20 years, the situation of many hydrometeorological services in developing countries has worsened, primarily because of underfunding, low visibility, economic reforms, and in some instances military conflict. As a result, many hydrometeorological services do not function well, with some lacking the capacity to provide even a basic level of service. Observation networks have deteriorated, technology is outdated, modern equipment and forecasting methods are lacking, the quality of services is poor, support for research and development is insufficient, and the workforce has been eroded.
In Central Asia, for example, observation systems deteriorated dramatically after 1985. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the number of meteorological stations has been cut by 62 percent, and in Tajikistan the number of hydrological stations and posts has been cut by 41 percent. In both of these countries and Turkmenistan, upper-air observations--which are very important for forecasting but are expensive--have been completely abandoned. These trends are also observed in the rest of the world.
As a result, substantial human and financial losses have occurred, which could have been prevented if

hydromet agencies were more developed. And the ability to monitor local climate and increases in natural risk has eroded, making developing countries less able to anticipate and adapt to climate change.
Globally, more than 100 countries--over half of which are in Africa--need to modernize their hydrometeorological services. How much will modernization cost? A conservative estimate of highpriority investment needs in developing countries exceeds $1.5­$2.0 billion. In addition, a minimum of $400­500 million per year will be needed to support operations of the modernized systems (staff costs plus operating and maintenance costs). National governments should cover these recurrent costs, but few are ready to do so. Moreover, the amount of international support for the national hydrometeorological services is significantly below what is needed just for the high-priority items.
It has been estimated that upgrading all hydrometeorological information and early-warning capacity in developing countries would save an average of 23,000 lives annually and would provide between $3 billion and $30 billion per year in additional economic benefits related to disaster risk reduction.

In conclusion
The fact that disasters are often followed by a measurable increase in poverty is not a surprise, considering the findings of this chapter:
· Poor people are often highly exposed to natural hazards, and at the local level they are often more exposed than their wealthier neighbors.
· Poor people lose relatively more from disasters because their livelihood and asset portfolio is more vulnerable.
· The measures and policies that could be mobilized to help poor people manage natural risks in a changing climate amount to ""good development,"" with the important caveat that the design of such measures and policies needs to take into account climate change and the uncertainty it creates. All of these measures also face significant implementation challenges--but with climate change expected to increase risk in many places, it will become even more urgent to make meaningful progress with these measures.
One important implication of these findings is that the differential in risk levels between poor and nonpoor people may create a decoupling between aggregate growth and poverty reduction, meaning that the poverty reduction impacts of growth may decrease. Indeed, where the wealthier can protect themselves against disasters, natural hazards are unlikely to lead to a visible shock on GDP. However, the impact on poorer households, which does not appear in aggregate statistics, may nonetheless lock them into poverty traps, creating or magnifying regional pockets of poverty.
One of the most striking results is the vulnerability of children to natural disasters. This calls for targeted efforts to protect children in poor families from disasters and avoid irreversible consequences for their lifelong prospects. The next chapter expands this discussion to look at health shocks that poor people, and especially children, are exposed to, along with measures that could play a big

role in mitigating the consequences of natural disasters--namely the provision of better health services and care, and universal health coverage.

4 Under the Weather: Climate Change, Health, and the Intergenerational Transmission
of Poverty

Main Messages

· Climate change will magnify some threats to health, especially for poor and vulnerable people such as children and the elderly, but large uncertainties remain in what is still an emerging research field.
· Health shocks and poor health contribute to poverty through loss of income, health expenses, and caring responsibilities, so that climate change impacts on health will represent an additional obstacle to poverty reduction and will increase inequality.

· Development--notably better access to health care and to services such as water and sanitation infrastructure--has the potential to reduce, but not eliminate, the risks climate change poses for health.
· Universal health coverage would contribute greatly to climate change adaptation-- and monitoring and surveillance systems (both in the health and environmental sectors) will be critical to deal with emerging health issues.

Introduction
One reason why people fall into poverty, or cannot leave it permanently, is that they are sometimes affected by health shocks and diseases, or by a death in their household. Illness can reduce human capital through permanent health consequences and disability, which makes it difficult or impossible to

work and reduces productivity. It can also diminish financial assets through medical expenditures, especially in the presence of high borrowing costs (Krishna 2006).
Poor people are more vulnerable to health shocks because they have fewer resources with which to maintain good health, have less access to improved water and health care,

111

1 1 2  S H O C K W A V E S

and are more likely to depend on labor- intensive livelihoods that require good health such as agriculture or construction. As a result, they incur a more severe burden of disease than nonpoor people, and this burden hampers their ability to accumulate and retain assets and improve living conditions.
Chapters 2 and 3 explored two key channels of poverty--agriculture and ecosystems, and natural disasters--noting that climate change impacts on agriculture and ecosystems and that natural disasters affect health in many different direct and indirect ways, such as through undernutrition due to lower crop productivity, or via the spread of diseases after a disaster.
This chapter explores how health, the third key channel of poverty in this report, will be affected by climate change. A changing climate can reduce the quantity and quality of water resources, along with altering the susceptibility to, and spatial distribution of, climate-sensitive diseases. And climate change is likely to amplify many of the diseases that already threaten poor households--for instance, by allowing malaria-bearing mosquitoes to spread in new places, or accelerating the replication of pathogens in water. Even climate change adaptation measures can contribute to worsening health conditions. Irrigation dams, water storage receptacles, and other land use and water management practices can create suitable conditions for vectors and pathogens to reproduce, thereby worsening the incidence of disease (AsensoOkyere et al. 2011; Keiser et al. 2005; Medlock and Vaux 2011).
These potential impacts of climate change on health are important in and of themselves, as they could directly cause a massive reduction in well-being. But they could also affect households in economic terms, magnifying the initial impact on welfare. This chapter begins by reviewing the evidence on the impact of health shocks and poor health on poverty. It then summarizes what we know about the health impacts of climate change and concludes with options to minimize these impacts, including better health infrastructure and universal health coverage.

Our main message is that economic development--notably better access to health care and to services such as water and sanitation infrastructure--has the potential to reduce, but not eliminate, the enhanced risks that climate change poses for health.
Disease and poor health contribute to poverty
The impact of poor health on low-income households is already large. In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the number of deaths in children under five is much higher than in other regions, as shown in figure 4.1. Diarrheal and respiratory diseases, and malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, contribute significantly to this gap. For adults, there is a striking difference in the diseases that affect rich and poor countries. In particular, communicable diseases--including HIV--represent almost half of the cause of mortality for adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, while in richer regions non-communicable diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, dominate (WHO 2015).
Over 40 percent of the global burden of disease attributed to environmental factors falls on children under five years of age, most of them living in developing countries. An estimated 800,000 out of the annual 2 million deaths among children under the age of five caused by respiratory infections is due to indoor air pollution; another 760,000 children die as a result of diarrhea (WHO 2013a). These deaths could be prevented with minimal health care and better hygiene, shifting toward cleaner fuels, and by better access to safe water and improved sanitation.
Diseases--and more generally poor health--increase poverty for several reasons. Health expenditures can absorb a large share of a household's income. Diseases reduce productivity because of missed work and school days, caregiving responsibilities, or reduced productivity. And in the long term, they can impair children's development and reduce their ability to learn, which can affect earnings.

Health care costs are regressive and have large impacts on poor households
Health expenditures absorb a large share of poor households' budget, especially in developing countries. Whereas higher-income countries tend to have more sophisticated social insurance systems to support access to health care, financial risk protection is largely absent in lower-income countries, where about half of health costs borne by households are out of pocket (figure 4.2). These poorer households typically rely on their own funds, remittances, private health insurance, or external resources (such as development assistance or support from nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]). Public funds for health care are rarely available to those who need them the most, and in most low-income countries the bottom quintile receives less than its share of public outlays for health.
Catastrophic health expenditures often drag people into poverty. In western Kenya, nearly 73 percent of households mention health expenses as a principal reason for their decline into poverty, and 32 percent mention the death of a major earner as a result of illness as a contributing factor to their poverty

(Krishna et al. 2004). Similar results are found in several countries (Krishna 2007) (figure 4.3). And even when households have the means to cover health care costs, illness has a regressive cost burden on poorer patients and households (Asenso-Okyere et al. 2011).
Looking at malaria, a review of multiple studies in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka finds the cost of treatment ranging from $0.41 to $5.98 per month, per person,1 which can be a significant burden for poor people relative to their monthly income or expenditure. In Malawi, malaria treatment represents 2 percent of monthly income for the average household, but 28 percent for the poor (Ettling et al. 1994). In Kenya, malaria accounts for 7.2 percent of household expenditure on average in wet seasons and 5.9 percent in dry seasons--but for the bottom quintile the ratios increase to 11 percent in wet seasons and 16.1 percent in dry seasons (Chuma, Thiede, and Molyneux 2006). For diarrhea, the cost of treatment can also be significant for poor households, especially if the cost of transport to health care facilities is included (Hutton and Haller 2004).

In the extreme case where one household member dies, the economic impact on the other members can be large, not only through the loss of income but also through funeral expenses. Household surveys in India, Kenya, Peru, and Uganda find that in some places funeral expenses represent a significant cause of poverty, sometimes comparable to health expenditures (figure 4.3) (Krishna 2007).

Forgone wages, reduced productivity, and caregiving responsibilities increase poverty
Missed days of work as a result of illness-- and resulting wage forgone--can also have a significant impact on income. Table 4.1 reviews studies on the number of days lost because of malaria episodes in various countries, for the sick and for the caregiver (which is an important component because it is often children who are affected). Because people can go through many episodes per year, the total number of days lost to malaria can be large. In Oyo State in Nigeria, adults lost on

average 22 working days per year to the disease (Ajani and Ashagidigbi 2008). For diarrhea, which can reach 3 to 7 days per episode, it is usually the caregiver who is missing work, since it mostly affects children (Hutton and Haller 2004). And missed days of work can be even more detrimental if people are fined or even fired when they miss work (World Bank and Australian AID 2014).
Disease can also lower productivity or result in the complete inability to work. In agrarian households in Africa, repeated malaria illness has led to a decline in farm output and income and contributed to greater incidence of poverty (ESPD 2005). In Ho Chi Minh City, frequent floods were found to be a cause of chronic respiratory disease, rheumatism, and skin and intestinal diseases, especially for children under five, rendering affected people and caregivers unable to work (World Bank and Australian AID 2014; this report, chapter 3).
Impacts on child development result in the intergenerational transmission of poverty
Children, with less mature immune systems, are more susceptible to illness--and tend to have less access to health care when they most need it after a shock. In Côte d'Ivoire, the share of children taken to a health practitioner fell from 50 percent to around 33 p ercent in areas of extreme rainfall (Jensen 2000). In Nicaragua, after Hurricane Mitch, children in affected communities were 30 percent less likely to be taken to health care facilities when ill (Baez and Santos 2007).

This lack of access to health care for children matters greatly because illness has particularly severe impacts on children. Children--particularly those under the age of five--are in critical periods of their development so that illness and malnutrition can affect lifelong health, educational attainment, and labor market outcomes. And when poor families cannot protect their children from these effects, poverty can be transmitted from one generation to the next, depriving children of a fair chance to escape poverty.
Illness can lead to irreversible effects on cognitive function, either because it affects the supply of nutrients to the brain or because of responses in the immune system that damage the structure of the brain (Jukes 2005). This is particularly true of illnesses that affect the central nervous system (such as severe cerebral malaria), which lead to lifelong cognitive impairment in survivors. In Kenya, children aged six to seven who had suffered cerebral malaria were found to be 4.5 times more likely than their peers to suffer cognitive impairments (ranging from mild challenges to severe learning difficulties) (Holding et al. 1999). Similar results were found in Senegal among children between the ages of 5 and 12 who had suffered cerebral malaria with coma before the age of 5 (Boivin 2002).
Chronic undernutrition is associated with impairment in the development of cognitive functions in young children, with subsequent effects on sociability and educational attainment (Grantham-McGregor 1995; Whaley et al. 1998). In Jamaica, children who suffered from severe undernutrition between 6 and 24

1 1 6  S H O C K W A V E S

months of age lagged behind their adequately nourished peers in overall IQ, vocabulary, and education tests, even when accounting for differences in backgrounds (GranthamMcGregor et al. 1994).
More generally, reduced access to education associated with health shocks and disasters impact lifelong prospects. Children who are withdrawn from school to earn income and support their households are particularly at risk for long-term effects on their earning potential (Asenso-Okyere et al. 2011). Children exposed to extreme natural disasters tend to spend fewer years in school and have lower educational achievement, delayed development, behavioral issues, and lower IQ (Caruso 2015; Currie 2009; del Ninno and Lundberg 2005; Victora et al. 2008).
But these impacts are not unavoidable--as evidenced by the fact that long-lasting impacts on children's health are only observed in a small share of the population and chronic impacts are not manifest in more than 30 percent of those affected by a disaster (Bonanno et al. 2010). Many of these impacts can be avoided or managed by strategic prioritization, sufficient allocation of resources, and political will to manage transient shocks and increase the resilience of individuals and households. Policies that reduce the exposure and vulnerability of children to risks and facilitate recovery after shocks will be essential to manage the impacts of climate change, particularly in poor communities (see chapter 5).
Climate change magnifies threats to health, especially for poor people
So health matters for poverty, and the evidence is growing that climate change matters for health. We know that higher temperatures, varied rainfall patterns, and more frequent droughts and floods will affect health in many ways--through heat exposure, undernutrition, natural disasters, and increased proliferation and transmission of illnesses that affect poor households (such as malaria and diarrhea). Hales et al. (2014)

estimate that by the year 2030, climate change could be responsible for an additional 38,000 annual deaths due to heat exposure among elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhea, 60,000 due to malaria, and about 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. Morbidity (incidence or prevalence of a disease) would also increase, with the consequences for poverty we described above (Hales et al. 2014). These estimates assume that socioeconomic development will reduce mortality rates, so numbers may be higher if development is slower or adaptation is less efficient than expected.
This section explores five health issues-- (i) vectorborne diseases (malaria); (ii) waterborne diseases (diarrhea); (iii) stunting; (iv) mental disorders; and (v) productivity loss due to high temperatures--that are likely to be sensitive to climate effects and to lead to large impacts on the well-being of the poor. Other issues, like diseases related to air pollution, are also likely to worsen with climate change (box 4.1).
Climate change threatens to reverse progress made on vectorborne diseases such as malaria
The first major health issue is vectorborne diseases, accounting for over 17 percent of all infectious diseases and causing more than 1 million deaths annually. Vectorborne diseases are caused by an infectious microbe transmitted to people mainly by bloodsucking insects. Their spread is determined by a combination of environmental and social factors. In recent years, globalization of travel and trade, urbanization, and environmental challenges have had a significant impact on transmission. Climate change also partly explains changes in the spatial distribution of these diseases (Beugnet and Chalvet-Monfray 2013).
Malaria is the most prevalent vectorborne disease in the tropics and subtropics and probably the most important for developing countries where insufficient health infrastructure, favorable climate, drug resistance, and poverty have made it difficult to control. It occurs all

BOX 4.1 Getting harder to breathe

Air pollution is already a challenge for human health--exposure to pollution can lead to heart and lung disease as well as increased hospital visits and mortality (Peel et al. 2005; Peel et al. 2007; Hoyt and Gerhart 2004; Moore et al. 2006). Globally, about 3.3 million premature deaths occur every year because of outdoor air pollution, predominantly in Asia (Lelieveld et al. 2015). Those who spend a lot of time outdoors and engage in physical activities (like outdoor workers, children, and athletes) and those who already suffer from respiratory diseases are the most vulnerable.
Will climate change make the situation worse? We know that higher temperatures and lower rainfall are likely to lead to a worsening of air quality in some areas. It may increase exposure to ground level ozone, small particulate matter, and air contaminants such as allergens and spores (Hogrefe et al. 2004).
Model projections indicate that, without greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reduction policies,

the contribution of outdoor air pollution to premature mortality could double by 2050 (Lelieveld et al. 2015). One study that looks at the impact of climate change­induced changes on p remature mortality estimates that there could be an increase of 100,000 premature deaths associated with small particulate matter exposure and 6,300 premature deaths associated with ozone exposure annually (Fang et al. 2013). The incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses is also expected to increase as a result of climate change (Takaro, Knowlton, and Balmes 2013; D'Amato et al. 2014).
Possible solutions lie in air surveillance systems and information campaigns to encourage adaptive behavior. In addition, certain technologies can be used to reduce emissions of many pollutants at the combustion source (like air filters or fuel switching). Some health cobenefits can also be expected from emissions-reduction policies (see chapter 6).

over the world, with an estimated 3.3 billion people exposed to the risk of infection. In 2013 alone, around 198 million cases occurred, leading to 584,000 deaths, mostly among children. The challenge is greatest in Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 90 percent of malaria-related deaths--78 percent of which occur in children under the age of five (WHO 2014). Four out of every ten people who die of malaria live in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria (WHO 2014). A large share of the deaths occurs among poor and vulnerable communities living in rural areas, with limited access to health facilities.
At the household level, malaria is a burden on incomes, especially because of health care costs. These household-level impacts add up to a significant impact on the growth and development of countries--with particularly dire effects on low-income countries. At the country level, a 10 percent reduction in

malaria could be associated with a 0.3 percent increase in annual growth (Gallup and Sachs 2001). Conversely, a study in Africa found that a 1 percent increase in malaria morbidity leads to a reduction in real GDP growth of 0.4 percent in Ghana (Okorosobo et al. 2011). In Kenya, 2­6 percent of production loss could be attributed to malaria incidence (Leighton and Foster 1993).
Fortunately, since 2000, there has been strong progress in reducing the incidence of malaria (map 4.1). Moreover, since the launch of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) global malaria eradication program in the 1950s, 79 countries have eliminated malaria, although mostly in temperate climates. With the shift in focus to malaria control (as opposed to eradication) in the tropics, the incidence has decreased by 33 percent in Africa and 17 percent globally (Caminade et al. 2014).

Climate change can favor vectorborne diseases such as malaria. Climate variability and change influence the epidemiology and geography of vectorborne diseases for several reasons. Rising temperatures boost the odds that climate-sensitive infectious diseases will emerge in new areas--as is already being observed in the densely populated highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia (Siraj et al. 2014). And they increase the likelihood of longer seasonal transmission and higher incidence in areas with high current burdens. Variability in temperature and precipitation affects the survival and reproduction of vectors that carry disease pathogens, their biting rate, and the incubation rate of pathogens within the vectors--either raising or lowering transmission. Changing precipitation patterns also affect the quantity and quality of breeding sites for vectors like mosquitoes, and shelter and food availability for disease-spreading rodents, affecting the odds of outbreaks (WHO 2003).

Higher temperatures could have a major effect on malaria transmission. At the global level, increases of 2°C or 3°C could raise the number of people at risk for malaria by up to 5 percent--affecting more than 150 million people (WHO 2003). In Africa, malaria could increase by 5 to 7 percent among populations at risk in higher altitudes due to rising temperature, possibly increasing the number of cases by up to 28 percent (Small, Goetz, and Hay 2003).
Moreover, if adaptation measures to cope with other consequences of climate change are not designed carefully, they can also increase malaria prevalence. In Kumasi, Ghana, a study found that irrigated urban agriculture led to higher densities of anopheline mosquitoes (those responsible for transmitting malaria) in peri-urban and urban locations and a subsequent higher reported incidence of malaria than in nonagricultural parts of the city (Afrane et al. 2004).

Under the W eather : C limate C hange , H ealth , and the I ntergenerational T ransmission of P overt y  1 1 9

On the positive side, malaria is likely to decrease in areas where warming brings very high temperatures and less precipitation--the expected case for Central America and the Amazon. Above 34°C, transmission is reduced because it becomes more difficult for vectors and parasites to survive (Smith et al. 2014; WHO 2003). Already in Senegal, less precipitation and drought have led to the virtual disappearance of some mosquito species and reduced malaria prevalence by over 60 percent (Githeko et al. 2000).
Development and specific policies can eradicate--or at least control--malaria. Despite the expected change in climate conditions, the future of malaria will be largely determined by socioeconomic conditions, such as access to resources and the efficient use of existing prevention and treatment mechanisms (Gething et al. 2010; Hales et al. 2014).
One way to sort out the different influences is to examine the separate impacts of climate change and economic growth on malaria, and their combined impacts by 2050 (Béguin et al. 2011). As shown in map 4.2, panel a, an expansion of malaria is expected globally when only considering climate change impacts. When only considering economic growth, as map 4.2, panel b, shows, malaria is expected to contract in most places with the notable exception of large areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. And what would happen if we combined the two factors? We still expect to see a contraction of malaria by 2050, as map 4.2, panel c, shows. But climate change--even if it does not reverse the positive impacts of development--could still significantly slow down the contraction of malaria, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and India. By 2030, the same study finds that if both economic growth and climate change are present, an estimated 3.6 billion people could be at risk of malaria, including 100 million because of climate change. This number is about 30 percent lower than the estimate for the population at risk if economic growth were absent, which is around 5.2 billion.

The highland of east Africa is particularly likely to experience significant impacts with an increase in population at risk projected by all models and a potential reach of over 200 million additional people at risk of malaria by 2080 (Caminade et al. 2014).
Thus, greater efforts will still be needed if current gains in the malaria fight are to be maintained in spite of climate change. Increased transmission is most alarming in areas of unstable or seasonal transmission, as these populations have no immunity and health systems are less equipped, leading to much higher mortality rates (Chima, Goodman, and Mills 2003).

BOX 4.2 Dengue's future hinges on whether development or climate change prevails

Over the past 50 years, there has been a 30-fold increase in global cases of dengue fever, with an annual incidence of 390 million infections, mostly manifested in the Asia-Pacific region (Smith et al. 2014). Economic development and better infrastructure are expected to reduce dengue in the future. But will climate change undercut some of that progress? And will it affect dengue's spread to other regions?
At this point, there is still a lot of uncertainty about how climate change will affect the distribution of dengue. This uncertainty is related partly to the fact that there are other important factors--notably urbanization and migration--besides climate change (Hales et al. 2002; Wilder-Smith and Gubler 2008). However, several studies show that its incidence is correlated with the weather, even though the effects are delayed for weeks or months (Hii et al. 2009; Johansson et al. 2009). Dengue fever seems to proliferate under both heavy precipitation and

drought conditions when households store water in containers suitable for mosquito breeding. This means that if these extreme events occur more often, it may extend the suitability of the areas for dengue. As a result, the dengue risk is likely to become more significant in parts of Europe (Bouzid et al. 2014) and Africa.
Predominantly an urban disease, dengue will be a greater risk in urbanized areas with poorly managed water and solid waste systems. Though climate change may extend the suitability of areas for dengue, economic development--including better access to piped water, strong vector control programs, and air-conditioning--can counter this effect. But in Africa, climate change could undermine the progress that has been made thanks to higher economic growth, making it more challenging to eradicate dengue and reduce its impacts on welfare and poverty (Åström et al. 2012).

Malaria prevalence can be reduced by measures such as mosquito control, improved access to bed nets and malaria treatments, and better buildings with air-conditioning. In Oman, in 2000, malaria was pervasive except for high-altitude and desert areas (Gallup and Sachs 2001), but in 2014, thanks to strategic intervention and significant resources, there are no indigenous cases of malaria (WHO 2014).
Successful elimination requires organization, resources, and strategies. Exposure is usually highest in remote and rural areas where vector control (removal of larvae breeding sites and residual indoor spraying) is difficult or impossible, making developing countries--like those in Africa where urbanization and connectivity are quite low--more vulnerable (WHO 2003). Also, medicine (such as chloroquine) has become ineffective in many areas, and new drugs are often unaffordable for poor populations.
Climate change is also expected to impact other vectorborne diseases--like dengue (box 4.2), encephalitis, Lyme disease, Rift

Valley fever, the plague, and chikungunya fever (Bouley and Planté 2014; Smith et al. 2014). Less is known about the relationship between climate change and these diseases, even though they could have significant and increasing impacts on well-being and poverty.
Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases are also expected to increase because of climate change
Poor water and food quality continue to pose a major threat to human health, especially for the poor. Soil-transmitted helminthes and schistosomes (parasitic worms) are some of the most prevalent chronic diseases in poor regions, with serious and insidious effects on health and nutrition (Stephenson, Latham, and Ottesen 2000). Diarrhea alone is responsible for 1.5 million deaths every year (WHO 2013a).
Diarrheal outbreaks can occur after drinking water becomes contaminated and are often reported after flooding and related

Under the W eather : C limate C hange , H ealth , and the I ntergenerational T ransmission of P overt y  1 2 1

displacement (Watson, Gayer, and Connolly 2007). In Bangladesh, after the 2004 floods, more than 17,000 cases of diarrhea were registered (Qadri et al. 2005), and the cholera epidemic in West Bengal, India in 1998 was attributed to preceding floods (Sur et al. 2000). In Pakistan, incidence of infectious disease and diarrhea increased as a result of the impact of the 2010 floods on the quality of water. Ongoing efforts to eradicate polio were also interrupted, further setting back this agenda (Warraich, Zaidi, and Patel 2011).
Diarrhea and other waterborne diseases affect households' well-being and prospects because they are so widespread. The cost of one episode of diarrhea is important for poor households, with treatment costs of $2­4 and the loss of a few days of work. But diarrhea can have even larger impacts, because it can provoke undernutrition by making children unable to absorb nutrients, even if they consume enough food. The total number of deaths caused directly or indirectly by undernutrition induced by unsafe water, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient hygiene is estimated at 860,000 per year among children under five (Vir 2011; this report, chapter 1).
Climate change can increase the risk of diarrhea through its impacts on temperature and water scarcity. Diarrhea is highly seasonal and higher rates of diarrhea have been associated with higher temperatures, although which specific pathogens are responsible for the association is unclear (Kolstad and Johansson 2010; Paz 2009). In Lima, Peru, a 4 percent increase in hospital admissions for diarrhea occurred for each °C increase in temperature during warmer months and a 12 percent increase for every degree centigrade increase in cooler months over six years of observation (Checkley et al. 2000).
Greater water stress will further challenge countries' ability to provide access to highquality water and push people to use lowerquality sources, increasing the risk from contaminated water. Lower water quantity also reduces dilution, degrades water quality, and can change how people use water, in ways that can increase infectious disease

transmission. In 18 Pacific islands, diarrhea cases increased with reduced water availability (Singh et al. 2001). Globally, low rainfall locations are strongly associated with higher diarrhea disease prevalence among children (Lloyd, Kovats, and Armstrong 2007). Hygiene is the main protection against diarrhea, but studies suggest that water scarcity makes it difficult for households to pursue it. In Peru, it was a lack of water that prevented a high awareness of the benefits from handwashing being translated into changed practices (Gilman et al. 1993).
Overall, climate impacts could increase the burden of diarrhea by up to 10 percent by 2030 in some regions (Kolstad and Johansson 2010; WHO 2003, 2002). An estimated 48,000 additional deaths annually among children under the age of 15 resulting from diarrhea illness are projected by then (Hales et al. 2014).
The combined effects of temperature fluctuation, coastal salinity, humidity, heavy rainfall, flooding, and drought are likely to contribute to outbreaks of other waterborne diseases such as cholera and schistosomiasis (Bandyopadhyay, Kanji, and Wang 2012; Cann et al. 2013; Delpla et al. 2009; Stephenson, Lathan, and Ottesen 2000). Schistosomiasis is second to malaria as the most devastating illness in the tropics, causing a debilitating illness that not only damages the internal organs of its patients but also has lasting impact on the growth and cognitive development of children (Asenso-Okyere et al. 2011).
The risk of diarrhea and other waterborne diseases is reduced by better infrastructure, education, and hygiene. To eradicate diarrhea, both infrastructure improvement and education are needed. The risk for diarrheal disease outbreaks is higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries (Ahern et al. 2005; Noji 2000)--and a significant number of these diseases could be prevented in developing countries through better access to safe water supply, adequate sanitation facilities, and better hygiene practices (Bartram and Cairncross 2010). Indeed, diarrhea is an important risk for poor households

1 2 2  S H O C K W A V E S

because of unsatisfactory hygiene conditions that are related to a lack of infrastructure (WHO 2008). The Global Monitoring Report 2014 (World Bank 2015a) shows large differences in access across groups even within lowincome countries, with access to improved sanitation for the poorest 40 percent of the population everywhere much worse than for the richer 60 percent (figure 4.4).
The prevalence of diarrhea decreases with income, across and within countries, but there is a large variance at low-income levels (figure 4.5), suggesting that even poor countries can do much to reduce the prevalence of the disease among poor people. In rural India, access to piped water can significantly reduce the frequency and duration of diarrhea

episodes among children under five, but only if combined with other behavioral interventions to promote good hygiene (Jalan and Ravallion 2003). Similar results are found elsewhere with an emphasis on the importance of systemic effects: for a family, gains from access to sanitation are relatively small; most of the benefits arise when the entire community gains access. Within poor communities, children living in a household with access to improved sanitation in a village with complete coverage manifest 47 percent fewer cases of diarrhea than children living in a household without access to improved sanitation in a village without sanitation coverage. One-fourth of this benefit can be attributed to household effects and the rest is due to community gains (Andres et al. 2014).

Climate change can exacerbate stunting
Despite international efforts in the last 15 years--and large progress in Latin America, some parts of Asia, and northern Africa-- severe undernutrition remains a problem in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Chronic undernutrition, or stunting, is defined as a very low weight for height (below -3z scores of the median WHO growth standards), whereby children are smaller and shorter but appear normal.
Stunting can start before birth and is caused by poor maternal nutrition, poor feeding practices, poor food or water quality, and frequent infections. Around 25 percent of stunting among young children can be linked to having had five or more episodes of diarrhea before the age of two (Checkley et al. 2008). The consensus among scientists is that the damage to physical growth, brain development, and human capital formation that occurs in the period before pregnancy to 24 months of age is largely irreversible (World Bank 2006; Black et al. 2008).
Stunting in childhood has been associated with a greater risk of noncommunicable diseases and lower economic productivity in adulthood. The medium- and long-term effects of an increase in stunting among children could significantly reduce their ability to cope with shocks. Moderate stunting increases the risk of death by 1.6 times and severe stunting by a staggering 4.1 times (Black et al. 2008). Even when not mortal, severe stunting brings a higher risk of morbidity and significantly reduces future education and earning potential (Victora et al. 2008; Maccini and Yang 2009; Maluccio et al. 2009). Stunting therefore contributes to poverty and its intergenerational transmission.
Over 800 million people are currently undernourished, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2015). Children are highly represented in these numbers, with over a third of the burden of disease in undernutrition attributable to children under five (Black et al. 2008). In 2011, around 45 percent of deaths among children (3.1 million deaths) could be attributed to

undernutrition (Black et al. 2013). And 165 million children under five years of age are stunted, 85 percent of whom live in 20 countries, mainly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF 2013).
Climate change will likely be a strong obstacle to the eradication of stunting. Its impacts on food production and ecosystems, and natural disasters (like droughts or floods) force poor and uninsured households to reduce their food intake and quality--which in turn can lead to more frequent manifestations of undernutrition and stunting, particularly among children. Modeling studies suggest that unabated climate change could significantly challenge the increase in available calories per capita in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Such an impact would directly affect food intake and health. Poorly designed land-based mitigation policies could magnify these issues by increasing competition for land, and thus reducing food availability and contributing to undernutrition and stunting (see chapter 2).
Regardless of socioeconomic development, climate change will largely increase severe

1 2 4  S H O C K W A V E S

stunting among children (figure 4.6). An additional 7.5 million children are expected to be stunted by 2030, of whom 3.9 million would be affected by severe stunting (a 4 percent increase). A WHO report estimates this number will rise in 2050 to about 10 million additional children stunted, with an increase of moderate stunting to about 6 million children (Hales et al. 2014). These estimates include assumptions on improved public health due to technology and economic development, but they do not include nonagricultural interventions, like water and sanitation provision. Climate change could lead to an increase in severe stunting of up to 23 percent in SubSaharan Africa and up to 62 percent in South Asia, compared to scenarios without climate change (Lloyd et al. 2011). These increases correspond to an absolute increase in the number of stunted children in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, with the negative effect of climate change outweighing the positive effect of e conomic growth.
The quality of the diet is also essential. At least half of children worldwide aged six months to five years suffer from one or more micronutrient deficiencies (iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate, and zinc), and globally more

than 2 billion people are affected.2 Climate change could reduce the nutritional quality of food and worsen this issue (Myers et al. 2014), but no quantified estimate of the impact is available.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, there is evidence that households provide lower-quality nutrition to children in response to weather shocks (Alderman, Hoddinott, and Kinsey 2006; Dercon and Porter 2014; Hoddinott 2006; Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005), which in turn increases the likelihood that they will suffer illness (Dercon and Porter 2014). These household behaviors and trends have significant and long-lived impacts on physical health, particularly for younger children and women. In Ethiopia, as early as six months following a disaster, households that reduced the nutritional quality of their food intake displayed lowered growth among children under two years by 0.9 cm (Yamano, Alderman, and Christiaensen 2005).
Climate-related shocks and disruptions can increase mental disorders and may exacerbate the ""cognitive tax""
The evidence is growing that poverty is associated with mental disorders, even though the causality is unclear (Patel and Kleinman 2003). In developed countries, rates of mental disorders are much higher among low-income and homeless people than the rest of the population (Bassuk et al. 1998; Fazel et al. 2008). In low- and middle-income countries, a review of 115 studies reports a positive association between a range of poverty indicators and mental disorders (Lund et al. 2010).
We know that natural disasters can cause high levels of stress and mental disorders. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in populations affected by flooding and during slow-onset events such as droughts (Ahern et al. 2005; Paranjothy et al. 2011). In Nicaragua, a study of adolescents half a year after Hurricane Mitch found instances of PTSD, stress, and depression, particularly among those in most affected communities who suffered the highest impact and those

Under the W eather : C limate C hange , H ealth , and the I ntergenerational T ransmission of P overt y  1 2 5

who experienced a death in the household (Goenjian et al. 2001). In Sri Lanka, children between the ages of 8 and 14 in areas affected by the 2004 tsunami had rates of PTSD ranging from 14 to 39 percent within a month of the event (Neuner et al. 2006). These trends can lead to chronic distress and increased incidence of suicide (Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom 2010; Hanigan et al. 2012; Keshavarz et al. 2013). To mitigate impacts, psychosocial and psychological interventions must be incorporated into disaster response and recovery management interventions.
The worry is that climate change may exacerbate mental disorders and stress. It could do so directly through greater exposure to trauma (from floods and other disasters) but also indirectly through impacts on physical health, household dynamics, and community wellbeing. Poor households, already strained by the pressures of poor living conditions and scarce resources, could be more prone to larger

mental health effects after exposure to extreme weather events. After Hurricane Katrina in the United States, those with anxiety prior to the storm were more likely to experience PTSD symptoms afterward, and younger children had more symptoms (Kronenberg et al. 2010; Weems et al. 2007). In the longer term, flooding affects perceptions of security and safety and can lead to depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other chronic and severe mental health disorders (Ahern et al. 2005; Berry, Bowen, and Kjellstrom 2010; Fritze et al. 2008; Paranjothy et al. 2011). Higher temperatures and extreme rainfall also raise concerns about more frequent conflicts, which tend to impede poverty reduction (box 4.3).
Risks and stresses also affect cognitive performance and decision making. Planning for contingencies (for example, because of a shock), unpredictable income, and constant worry about the financial situation create stress and depression for the poor, which

BOX 4.3 The uncertain triangle of climate change, conflict, and poverty

Conflict, fragility, and lack of security and stability are fundamental barriers to poverty reduction and the well-being of the poor (World Bank 2011). This is illustrated by the increasing share of poor people living in conflict environments. In the 33 countries (representing half a billion people) classified by the World Bank as fragile and conflict-affected states, the poverty headcount is 51 percent. Similarly, within c ountries, poor people are also more exposed to crime: in Cape Town, South Africa, 44 percent of all homicides occur in three neighborhoods that are among the city's poorest (World Bank 2013, chapter 4).
What type of impact does the environment--and potentially climate change--have on conflicts? This is an area of active research (Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2014), which can be split into studies covering conflicts from either the interpersonal level (like assaults and rape) or the intergroup (national) level (like civil conflicts, wars, and riots).
Interpersonal conflicts: There is a strong correlation in the United States between crime and violence and temperature, raising the question of whether climate

change will increase murders, assaults, rape, and other violence (Ranson 2014). In developed countries, studies typically cite psychological factors for this correlation (such as people become more aggressive during heat waves). In less developed countries, like India, the trigger may be lower income from higher temperatures, which in turn can raise crime rates (Iyer and Topalova 2014).
Intergroup conflict: A large body of literature suggests a link between weather or climate and conflict, especially in low-income areas. A meta-analysis suggests that intergroup conflicts increase by 11 percent when temperatures increase one standard deviation and by 3.5 percent when rainfall deviates one standard deviation (Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel 2013; Burke, Hsiang, and Miguel 2014). However, a vigorous debate has emerged around the robustness of these results (Buhaug et al. 2014; Hsiang, Burke, and Miguel 2014), with the IPCC noting that ""collectively the research does not conclude that there is a strong positive relationship between warming and armed conflict"" (Adger et al. 2014).

reduces focus, lowers productivity, and interferes with making long-term decisions (Banerjee and Duflo 2012). Poor people may have little time or energy to think about the future, as their day-to-day economic lives are more consuming of cognitive control than for the rich (Banerjee and Duflo 2012). This effect has been referred to as the ""cognitive tax"": the high level of stress of poor people acts like a tax that reduces their productivity and earnings, contributing to their poverty.
Already today, natural risks are a major source of stress. In flood-prone wards of Mumbai, 71 percent of the households surveyed cited flooding as a critical stressor, second only to ""hectic life,"" and more important than stress from transportation or congestion (figure 4.7) (Patankar, forthcoming). Against the background of anticipated more frequent natural hazards due to climate change, this cognitive tax for poor people may increase.
High temperatures are a health hazard and affect labor productivity
Though extreme cold-related deaths will decrease in temperate regions, the negative effects of heat waves will likely outweigh these

benefits. Health effects from extreme heat exposure are expected to result from both higher average seasonal temperature and more frequent and intense extreme heat wave events (Huang et al. 2011; IPCC 2014). Chapter 3 discussed exposure to heat waves, showing that poor individuals are more likely to be exposed to higher temperature, especially in hot countries. It also showed that poor people are particularly vulnerable to high temperatures, because of their living conditions, the poor quality of their housing, and a lack of access to air-conditioning. Here, we explore the consequences of this exposure to high temperature, looking at direct health consequences and their impacts on performance and productivity.
Heat-related problems will not be limited to developing regions. It is projected that, globally, by 2030, without accounting for adaptation, there could about 100,000 additional deaths annually in 2030--and 250,000 annual deaths in 2050--among those aged 65 and over (Hales et al. 2014). Of course, humans adapt, so adaptation may lower these estimates. But these estimates do not include morbidity and mortality in other age groups and among vulnerable people, nor do they factor in extreme heat wave events.
Most heat wave­related deaths occur among poor elderly people and people who have existing illnesses (such as cardiovascular or chronic respiratory diseases and mental illness) (WHO 2003). Urban dwellers are particularly at risk because of inefficient housing and the heat island effect--where urban environments with high thermal mass and low ventilation retain heat, thereby amplifying the rise in temperature, especially at night. Air-conditioning practices in urban areas further amplify this effect as indoor heat is transferred outdoors, which hurts the destitute and homeless. In Taiwan, China air- conditioning was found to have added 0.7°C to the outdoor temperature (Liu, Ma, and Li 2011). And as a greater portion of the population becomes elderly and urbanization increases, a bigger share of the population will be vulnerable to heat stress.
One possible solution is climate-smart urban design and innovative architecture,

Under the W eather : C limate C hange , H ealth , and the I ntergenerational T ransmission of P overt y  1 2 7

which can reduce this effect while taking advantage of shade provision, solar heat management, and other measures that use thermal insulation to minimize energy consumption (Masson et al. 2013; Masson et al. 2014; Stone, Hess, and Frumkin 2010). Additionally, well-designed early warning and surveillance systems can help detect and respond to heat waves. These must be adapted to the levels of risk so as to have a significant impact on reducing mortality (Ebi et al. 2004; Schmier and Ebi 2009).
High temperatures reduce labor productivity and can thus increase poverty. A wellestablished medical and task productivity literature has uncovered a systematic relationship between temperature stress of the human body and reduced performance (Seppänen, Fisk, and Lei 2006). Lab experiments have quantified this relationship by randomly assigning subjects to rooms of varying temperatures and asking them to perform cognitive and physical tasks. They find that extreme temperature reduces human performance on a wide range of tasks, including time estimation, vigilance, and higher cognitive functions (like mental arithmetic and simulated flight) (Grether 1973). A review of the experimental literature finds that in laboratory settings task productivity improves up to a temperature threshold of around 20°C to 25°C, but after that it declines significantly--with the average productivity loss on the order of 2 percent per °C for the various tasks surveyed (figure 4.8). Similarly, a review of historical fluctuations in temperature within countries identifies that higher temperatures reduce economic growth in poor countries (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2012).
Responses by workers to temperature shocks may take many forms (Heal and Park 2013; Zivin and Neidell 2014). There may be declines in task productivity, labor supply (hours worked), labor effort, or all three. The emerging microeconometric literature finds evidence for at least the first two in particular, and likely reflects a combination of all three-- the specific breakdown of which will depend on labor market institutions and specific

incentives faced by workers. And even though these studies focus on the developed world, a similar impact in developing countries can be expected.
In developing countries, temperatures above 24­25°C are associated with poorer performance (Federspiel et al. 2004). Indian manufacturing worker efficiency at the plant level declines substantially on hotter days, with a magnitude of roughly minus 2.8 p ercent per °C, an effect that is driven primarily by on-the-job task productivity decline as opposed to increased missed days of work or absenteeism (Adhvaryu, Chari, and Sharma 2013; Sudarshan et al. 2015). Granted, air-conditioning is typically a scarce commodity in the developing world, but there does seem to be evidence that the same phenomena occur even in developed economies such as the United States (Deryugina and Hsiang 2014; Park, forthcoming). This result suggests that air-conditioning, while useful, may not be able to cancel out all of the impacts from higher temperature.
There is also evidence of a drop in labor supply in response to heat stress (Zivin and Neidell 2014). In U.S. industries with a high exposure to climate, workers report less time spent at work and less time spent on outdoor leisure activities, on hot and cold days. At temperatures over 38°C, labor supply in outdoor industries drops by as much as one hour per day compared to those in the 24­27°C range. Using U.S. plant-level output data from

1 2 8  S H O C K W A V E S

1994­2004 for the automobile sector, a study found that hot days are associated with lower output across the board. At the extreme, a week with six or more days above 32°C reduces that week's production by about 8 percent (Cachon, Gallino, and Olivares 2012).
Poorer households are more likely to be affected by the downsides of higher temperatures because they are less likely to benefit from air conditioning and more likely to work in sectors that are more sensitive to temperature stress: namely, manual labor­ intensive industries, and outdoor work­ intensive sectors (like agriculture and construction). It is also likely the case that manual labor and outdoor work occupations pay lower wages on average. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average construction laborer earns 25 percent less than the median U.S. worker, and laborers in the farming, fishing, and forestry sector earn 48 percent less (BLS 2015).
It remains unclear how much can be expected from adaptation and how large the expected social costs of adaptation will be-- whether in the form of physical capital investments, relocation costs, or the nonpecuniary costs of changing habit patterns and social norms. Also, the role of technological change is unclear; the same goes for possible public investment in research and development on these issues.
Climate change impacts on individual productivity could have an effect at the macroeconomic level. As to the toll climate change might take on economic growth at the global and national levels, researchers have long noted a relationship between temperature and macroeconomic variables (namely income and growth). As far back as Montesquieu in the 18th century (Huntington 1922; Montesquieu 1758), there has been a suggestion that extreme climate may reduce economic growth. Using data from agricultural and manufacturing occupations in North Carolina, a study showed that aggregate productivity was highest in moderate temperatures (fall and spring), and lower in more extreme temperatures (summer, winter) (Huntington 1922).

Since then, numerous cross-country analyses have suggested that hotter countries have tended to grow more slowly on average. Many have noted that hotter countries tend to have lower income levels generally--with a gradient of roughly minus 8.5 percent per capita income per °C hotter average temperatures (Dell, Jones, and Olken 2009; Horowitz 2009). However, it is likely that unobservable effects play an important role (like institutions, levels of human capital, and agricultural productivity) (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2000).
This negative relationship between temperature and income seems to hold within countries, albeit to a milder extent. This suggests that institutional factors are not wholly responsible for the temperature-productivity relationship and there are limits to adaptation through better buildings and air-conditioning. An assessment of incomes at the municipality level for 12 U.S. counties finds that a 1°C rise in temperature is associated with 1.2­1.9 p ercent lower per capita income (Acemoglu and Dell 2009). Similar results are found analyzing a larger set of counties, using U.S. income and payroll data from 1986­2012 (Deryugina and Hsiang 2014; Park, forthcoming).
Health care systems and development pathways play a critical role
The outcome of climate-induced health effects will be determined by institutional structures and the combined effects of parallel global changes--such as urbanization, population growth, and demographic shifts. Also relevant are social norms and behavior, along with differences in the vulnerability of populations due to nonclimatic factors (Ebi and Semenza 2008; Patz et al. 2005; Sutherst 2004). For instance, in developing countries, around 43 percent of the reduction in the number of children underweight between 1970 and 1995 can be attributed to greater access to education for women, 26 percent to greater access to food, and 19 percent to improved water and sanitation (Smith and Haddad 2000).

Health infrastructure, access, and quality of care need to be improved
Given that low-income countries will be the most vulnerable because of limited public health infrastructure, a top priority should be improving health care. Often, treatable illnesses are not addressed because of lack of access to adequate health care services. In rural areas, transportation may not be available to transfer the ill to clinics. Further, many of these rural clinics do not have adequate equipment or trained health personnel, and require payment up front.
Today, the share of births attended by skilled health staff is close to 100 percent for countries above GDP per capita of $20,000 but varies widely below this level, suggesting progress can be made even at low-income levels (figure 4.9, panel a). If skilled health staff are not available--for birth, injuries, or diseases--people are more likely to suffer from permanent consequences on health, income, and well-being. Improving health care systems (staff training, vaccination programs, information campaigns, and access to rapid diagnostic kits and drugs for treatment) is therefore essential. With significant investments over the next 20 years, it is possible to improve the level of health care

supply in low-income countries to the level of the best middle-income countries today (Jamison et al. 2013).
Although beyond the scope of this report, the health sector can also play a role in emissions reductions. In the United Kingdom, this sector is responsible for about 25 percent of all public sector emissions and, in the United States, about 8 percent of total emissions. It is thus crucial that investments contribute to greening the health infrastructure.
The risk from emerging diseases or unexpected crises also increases the urgency to put in place effective risk monitoring systems (Wesolowski et al. 2015; Semenza and Menne 2009) and to share experience and information (Ebi and Burton 2008)--as illustrated by the emergence of chikungunya in France, Italy, and the Caribbean. This means an urgent need for surveillance systems that rely on all participants in the health care system (especially private practice physicians), effective communication of good behaviors through general media, and international cooperation and exchange of information. Such efforts pay off. Following the 2003 heat wave in France, the government introduced a heat wave warning system and national action plan. Health worker training and new infrastructure helped avoid an estimated

BOX 4.4 Universal health coverage: Kenya's bottom-up strategy

Launched in 2010, Kenya's Health Sector Services Fund (HSSF) aims to expand the supply of health care and strengthen primary care by providing direct cash transfers to public health facilities-- particularly in rural areas where health centers and dispensaries are a primary source of care and over 80 percent of the population resides. Jointly supported by the government of Kenya, the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), and the World Bank, this initiative complements better access and transparency of resources with sector reforms to improve the availability of human resources and essential medicine for service delivery. The HSSF encourages transparency, community participation in decision making, and accountability for resource allocation and results. Local communities are tasked with managing the funds through representative management committees and work with the staff of health facilities to improve delivery of services.
So far, this initiative has reached 3,000 public primary health facilities and boosted the use of health facilities. Preliminary observations show

better reporting and accounting for user fees collected and stronger information and governance systems. In some facilities, these funds were used effectively to upgrade service delivery (such as providing electricity in maternity wards for 24-hour services) and better maintain facilities by hiring more local staff. A successful pilot exploring the incorporation of performance-based financing in this program shows further potential for improving service quality (for example, with better prenatal care and more child immunization).
The direct funding provided by HSSF has helped ensure that resources reach the periphery of the health system at low levels of bureaucratic interference without compromising transparency. A demand-based ""pull system"" approach that requires facilities to order supplies and commodities based on need, as opposed to centrally determined allocation, has significantly reduced wastage and expiry of drugs while increasing the reliable availability of health commodities.

4,400 deaths in a subsequent 2006 heat wave (Fouillet et al. 2008; Pascal et al. 2006).
And research and development efforts in the health sector should be intensified to better prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases that affect poor people, especially those that are expected to increase over time, including because of climate change. This is especially true for the so-called ""neglected tropical diseases""--those diseases that thrive mainly among the world's poorest populations.3 Of these, several, such as dengue, leishmaniasis, and chikungunya are sensitive to climate and likely to change in spatial distribution with climate change. Private research and development (R&D) alone is unlikely to develop the needed solutions without public intervention (Trouiller et al. 2001). Today, annual R&D spending on ""infectious diseases of particular concern to low-income and m iddle-income countries"" amounts only

to $3 billion--out of the nearly $250 billion spent annually on health-related R&D (Jamison et al. 2013).
Social protection systems can also play a significant role, especially in helping avoid irreversible losses from undernutrition--but only if they can be scaled up quickly after shocks and targeted to reach the poorest and most vulnerable (Alderman 2010; Clarke and Hill 2013; this report, chapter 5).
Universal health care coverage is an adaptation priority
Even if skilled health care is available, its affordability is not a given. Health shocks tend to bring households into poverty even more where people have to borrow, often at high interest rates, creating debts that they may never be able to repay (Krishna 2006). The WHO estimates that about 100 million

Under the W eather : C limate C hange , H ealth , and the I ntergenerational T ransmission of P overt y  1 3 1

people fall into poverty each year just to pay for health care (WHO 2013b). A big problem is that financial risk protection varies widely, with people in low-income countries having to bear very high and variable fractions of out-of-pocket health expenditure (figure 4.9, panel b).
Thus, better health care coverage and lower out-of-pocket expenses would be efficient ways to reduce the health impacts of climate change vulnerability and reduce poverty, especially by helping the poor to manage catastrophic health expenditures (Jamison et al. 2013). Providing health coverage is possible at all income levels, but context and implementation challenges will determine the optimal path for countries, as the case in Kenya illustrates (box 4.4). Rwanda invested in a universal health coverage system in 1994, and today over 80 percent of its population is insured.
Employment-based social insurance is limited to the formal sector. But strategic policies that promote equitable and propoor financing mechanisms can accelerate the p rocess toward universal health coverage. In Thailand, the government has expanded coverage to the informal sector with a minimal charge of $0.70 per visit, drawing on general tax revenues. In Colombia, through a multilevel government scheme and cross-subsidization from contributory schemes, the poor are covered against primary care and catastrophic event costs--with coverage among the poorest quintile rising from 3 to 8 percent in 1993 to 47 percent by 1997. In parts of Africa and Asia, an efficient tool is communityfinanced coverage schemes that pool expenditure risks at lower administrative levels. Strong community solidarity and administrative capacity is important for these interventions (O'Donnell 2007).
What can we learn from past efforts to expand health coverage? Four insights stand out: (i) affordability is important but not sufficient to achieve universal access, and measures to ensure affordability should be included within a broader strategy; (ii) targeting the poor is necessary, but it is also

important to assess the consequences of reforms on the nonpoor; (iii) solutions are best designed starting from population needs--including the local epidemiological profile, major barriers to access to care, unsatisfied demand, and major sources of financial hardship; and (iv) highly focused interventions (such as on one barrier to access or one disease) can be a useful initial step toward universal coverage (Giedion, Andrés Alfonso, and Díaz 2013).
In conclusion
Health shocks and poor health bring and keep people in poverty, and can reduce lifelong earning prospects when children are affected. Climate change is expected to worsen many of these issues--although big uncertainties remain, such as the extent to which climate change will affect the nutritional quality of food. Moreover, the combined effects of multiple health stressors are largely unknown, in spite of the importance of interactions among diseases. For instance, undernourished children are known to be more vulnerable to malaria and other vectorborne or waterborne diseases, but these interactions have not been investigated yet in the context of climate change.
The encouraging news is that economic development, poverty reduction, and better infrastructure and access to health care could compensate for many of the negative projected climate-related trends. Indeed, if developing countries could achieve the present level of health care access in industrialized countries by 2030, they could avoid many of the impacts that would worsen health conditions. Child mortality could fall by an estimated 63 percent globally if coverage rates of effective prevention and treatment mechanisms rose to 99 percent (Jones et al. 2003).
A recent Lancet Commission on Investing in Health concludes that by 2035, a ""grand convergence"" in mortality and morbidity rates across the world is achievable, as is the global provision of universal health care

1 3 2  S H O C K W A V E S

(Jamison et al. 2013). The report contends that enhanced investments to scale up health technologies and systems in developing countries could bring down mortality rates in most low-income and middle-income countries to those presently seen in the best- performing middle-income countries. This would mean the prevention of about 10 million deaths in 2035 in these poorer countries relative to a scenario of stagnant investments and no improvements in health technology. The benefit-cost ratio of these investments is estimated between 9 and 20, without accounting for climate change. And, as this chapter has shown, climate change only amplifies the benefits of acting now to improve health services.
Of course, a ""grand convergence"" would significantly reduce the impact of climate change on poor people through the health channel. But even with prevention and hygiene, and even if health care and health coverage are available, diseases and accidents cannot be fully prevented--and they will continue to lead to reduced income, lost days of work, and higher expenses. To help poor households cope with these shocks and avoid the irreversible impacts on children's development and education, other tools can be mobilized and developed, such as financial products to save and borrow, social safety nets (such as cash transfers and social insurance), and remittances and support from family and friends. The next chapter explores how these instruments can help, and whether they need to be designed differently, in a context of climate change.

5 Lend a Hand: Poor People,
Support Systems, Safety Nets, and Inclusion

Main Messages

· Poor people struggle more than others to cope with and adapt to climate change and natural hazards: not only are they more exposed and vulnerable to shocks but the support they receive from families, communities, financial system, and government is also weaker, and they are often not granted a voice in decision-making processes.
· Financial inclusion, insurance, social safety nets, and remittances complement each other in protecting different populations against different types of shocks.

· Given the limits to how much protection the financial system can offer, especially to the poorest, social safety nets are needed to provide effective protection to poor households. To be effective, safety nets must be rapidly scalable, even if speed of delivery may come at the cost of targeting.
· An adaptive social protection system creates a formal liability for the government, which may need to draw on instruments such as reserve funds, contingent finance, reinsurance products, or even international aid.

Introduction
Poor people are particularly exposed and vulnerable to the physical impacts of climate change, such as reduced crop yields, more intense floods, or lower productivity due to extreme temperature, making climate change and disasters a magnifier of existing inequalities. However, these direct impacts tell only part of the story. When people are affected by

a shock or a change in economic conditions (like higher food or energy prices), they may adapt to reduce the losses or even benefit from the changes. Hence, the overall impact on welfare and quality of life also depends on how well people cope and adapt.
One reason why poor people struggle to adapt to changes in environmental and economic conditions is limited resources--for instance, limited financial resources can push

141

1 4 2  S H O C K W A V E S

poor people to live in the most flood-prone areas of cities, even if they are aware of the risk (chapter 3). In addition, as discussed in the World Bank's World Development Report 2014: Risk and Opportunity, the ability to manage risk also depends on the ""support systems"" available to them: the household, the community, the enterprise and financial sectors, and the state. These support systems are also critical to help individuals and firms adapt to the effects of climate change, cope with the impacts that cannot be avoided, and deal with the potential adverse side effects from emissions-reduction policies.
This chapter investigates how these systems support people in the face of natural hazards, environmental changes, and economic and policy transitions. It assesses the obstacles that prevent effective risk management and adaptation to environmental and economic changes--and then suggests available policies to help poor people adapt to climate change and cope with its consequences. It follows by reviewing the role of financial instruments, social protection systems and safety nets, and migrations and remittances, closing with thoughts on governance and the poor.
The chapter finds that poor people's disproportionate suffering from climate

change and shocks arises not just from the fact that they are more exposed and vulnerable but also because they receive less support from financial instruments, social protection schemes, and private remittances. For instance, in response to flooding and landslides in communities in Nepal in 2011, only 6 percent of the very poor sought government support, compared to almost 90 percent of the well-off (Gentle et al. 2014). Besides suffering from larger immediate shocks than the wealthier, poor people also tend to be more alone in the struggle to cope and recover.
The key message of this chapter is the need for a holistic and flexible risk management strategy--with a range of policy instruments appropriate for different disasters and affected populations (figure 5.1). Revenue diversification and basic social protection, where it exists, can help households at all income levels cope with small shocks. But, when a shock is larger, these instruments will not be sufficient, and additional tools are needed. For relatively wealthier households, savings will help; and market insurance can provide them with efficient protection for larger losses. However, for the poorest households, savings are often not an option; and high transaction costs make private insurance unattainable.
For the poorest households--and to cover the largest shocks--well-targeted and easily scalable social safety nets are needed. These systems need to be designed so as to maintain incentives to invest in long-term adaptation to economic and environmental changes. Such an adaptive social protection system creates a liability for the government, which may need to rely on financial instruments such as reserve funds (for small-scale events), contingent finance, reinsurance products, or even international aid if its capacity is exhausted. Social protection systems and financial protection have always been needed to help people cope with individual and systemic shocks, including disease and natural disasters, but this

need has been intensified and made more urgent by climate change.
Saving, borrowing, and insurance help people adapt to changes and cope with shocks, but are not always accessible for poor people
People use financial instruments--notably their savings and assets--to smooth consumption and limit the effects of income shocks. While evidence suggests that this smoothing is significant, it is also far from complete (Kinnan and Townsend 2012; Morduch 1995). In extreme cases, households have even been found to reduce consumption to protect their assets, thus exacerbating consumption shocks (Zimmerman and Carter 2003). In general however, financial instruments (such as bank accounts and insurance contracts) can complement informal risk-sharing mechanisms and play a critical role in helping households and firms adapt to climate change, prepare for natural shocks, and recover when affected (World Bank 2013a, chapters 4 and 6).
We know that savings at financial institutions tend to be less vulnerable to natural disasters than in-kind savings (chapter 3). Livestock and housing can be washed away by a flood, while savings accounts are far less likely to be affected. Financial inclusion makes it possible for households to protect their savings and lower the vulnerability of their asset portfolio, so they can cope with income losses while maintaining consumption and avoiding radical coping measures, such as reduced food intake.
Financial inclusion also enables people and firms to reduce risk in the first place. For instance, if changes in rainfall patterns call for adapting farming activities, farmers will need to invest in new machines and seeds, or possibly learn new techniques. Without access to credit, these measures may be unaffordable, thus locking them into activities with declining productivity and income.

Poor people lack access to savings and credit, but policies can enhance financial inclusion
Unfortunately poor people often lack access to formal financial instruments--possibly because of the cost of bank accounts, large distance and time to access a financial agent, or lack of documentation and mistrust in banks. Some people also prefer to stay in the informal sector, or are not fully aware of the benefits of using financial tools for risk management (Allen et al. 2012). For instance, in Indonesia, more than 20 percent of households in the top 60 percent of the income distribution saved at a financial institution in 2011, compared to less than 8 percent from the bottom 40 percent. Poor people also have less access to credit when affected by a shock or worsening environmental conditions.
What can governments do? The 2014 World Development Report (World Bank 2013a, chapter 6) discusses the actions that governments can take to help households at all income levels gain access to financial instruments for risk management. Two categories emerge.
Financial infrastructure. To reduce costs and improve trust in the banking system, governments can strengthen the financial infrastructure (including payment and security settlement systems and public credit registries). Physical access to financial instruments can be improved by using the postal network, and improving infrastructure for hosting financial agents and facilitating transport (roads and public transit). Wide coverage by mobile phone networks can make financial instruments accessible virtually, by using cellular banking and electronic payment technologies (Gupta 2013).
Competition, protection, and flexibility. Governments can help keep service costs low by ensuring fair competition and consumer protection, or by requiring the introduction of low-cost bank accounts for vulnerable populations. Moreover, ensuring convenience and flexibility is critical for accommodating

1 4 4  S H O C K W A V E S

the relatively high frequency at which poor people tend to make deposits and withdrawals, or take out and repay loans. For instance, poor households benefit greatly from flexible loan schedules that can be readily renegotiated or forborne in ""hungry months,"" or paid in advance when the household enjoys extra liquidity. Experience from microcredit also demonstrates the benefits from schemes that create self-discipline--like using planned saving schedules (Banerjee and Duflo 2012). Poor people are also less able to protect themselves against fraud and abuse, underscoring the need for adequate and accessible consumer protection schemes. In Mexico and South Africa, the government has established financial ombudsmen to resolve disputes in consumer finance (Brix and McKee 2010).
While borrowing can help maintain consumption in the short term, it can also create a debt trap from which poor households have trouble escaping. For instance, health shocks are more likely to push people into poverty in the presence of high borrowing costs, precisely because of such trap effects (Krishna 2006). Stringent borrowing conditions paired with postdisaster destitution mean that poor households affected by disasters are likely to quickly incur high levels of debt.
In Bangladesh after the 1998 floods, borrowing was by far the most common coping mechanism chosen by a sample of 757 households in a postdisaster survey (del Ninno et al. 2001). Almost 60 percent of these households were in debt in the months immediately following the floods, with average debt rising to almost 1.5 months of average consumption. Furthermore, 57 percent of floodaffected households in the bottom three quintiles resorted to purchasing food on credit. This borrowing mitigated the shock, but higher prices meant that poor floodaffected households consumed less. The financial cost of borrowing was found to vary widely, with interest rates from zero (for many loans from family and neighbors) to an average of 50 percent for loans from banks and cooperatives. Better access to finance ex ante and lower interest rates could have reduced the debt trap and improved recovery.

The development of insurance markets in low-income economies faces many obstacles
To cope with large shocks that affect many people, savings or borrowing may not be adequate. Instead, insurance products can provide protection at a lower cost. However, insurance markets are complex, and behaviors often deviate from what theory suggests, making it challenging to provide appropriate insurance products to poor households or small firms in developing countries, which are often exposed to many risks (Kunreuther, Pauly, and McMorrow 2013).
The classical indemnity insurance products are commonplace in high-income countries and are based on the observation of losses, with insurance payments triggered once losses occur. Classical indemnity insurance requires that robust data be available for the insurer to assess risks ex ante--something that is often lacking in developing countries (Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013). And loss assessment may be costly if it requires that an expert visit every victim.
One problem with indemnity insurance is that asymmetric information results in adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection refers to the fact that if the price of insurance cannot be adjusted to the level of risk that clients face-- because the information is unavailable or too costly to collect--then those clients facing more risk will demand more insurance, threatening the sustainability of the insurance scheme. But this problem can be solved by making insurance mandatory, although it will be tough to do in countries with little capacity or where premiums would be particularly high.
Moral hazard refers to the fact that people protected against the negative impact of a shock could choose to do less to prevent the shock or reduce associated losses. In the case of insurance against natural hazards, moral hazard is mitigated by the fact that households suffer from significant nonmonetary uninsured losses (such as the hassle of relocation and loss of personal property if one's

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 4 5

house is flooded). In most contracts, it is mitigated further by deductibles, which ensure that the insured face a portion of the losses in case of a shock.
Even in developed countries, penetration of indemnity insurance against natural hazards remains low, albeit with some exceptions: (i) when insurance is subsidized, as with floods in the United States with the National Flood Insurance Program; (ii) when insurance is mandatory and backed by the g overnment-- such as the Turkish insurance against earthquakes and fires, which is an excellent example of how insurance access can be increased in middle-income countries (box 5.1); or (iii) when insurance is mandatory, cross-subsidized, and backed by the

government, the case of France's Cat-Nat storm and drought insurance (Paudel 2012). However, subsidizing insurance can be prohibitively expensive, and the penetration of indemnity insurance is very low in developing countries.
These problems have led to the development of index-based insurance products, in which insurance payments are not made based on observed losses, but when a physical variable--such as a rainfall deficit or wind speed--exceeds a predetermined threshold (regardless of the existence of losses). For instance, a farmer will receive a predefined insurance payment if rainfall is below a minimum threshold over a onemonth period. Index-based insurance

BOX 5.1 Developing catastrophe insurance in Turkey through public-private partnerships

Few countries in the world are more exposed to earthquakes than Turkey. Around 70 percent of its population and 75 percent of its industrial facilities are exposed to large-scale earthquakes. Since 1984, direct property and infrastructure losses due to earthquake episodes in Turkey have frequently exceeded $5 billion (in current US$ terms). The last major earthquake in the Marmara region in 1999 resulted in the loss of 15,000 lives and placed an enormous financial burden on the economy and the government.
Before 1999, earthquake insurance uptake had traditionally been low in Turkey (at around 3 percent of residential buildings) because households traditionally relied on the government to finance the reconstruction of private property after major natural disasters. This presented massive challenges to government budgets. But, in the aftermath of the Marmara earthquake, the government decided to develop a catastrophe risk insurance mechanism to reduce its fiscal exposure to natural hazards--arising from publicly funded reconstruction of private property. In 2000, it created a compulsory earthquake insurance system for all residential buildings on registered land in urban areas.
The World Bank provided financial and technical assistance for creating the Turkish Catastrophe

Insurance Pool (TCIP)--the first national catastrophe insurance pool in World Bank partner countries that provides a stand-alone earthquake insurance coverage to homeowners and small and medium enterprises. The TCIP provides mandatory property earthquake insurance for owners of private dwellings built legally on registered land. Premium rates are actuarially sound, not subsidized, and vary with construction type and property location. Covered risks include earthquakes and fire.
The catastrophe risk financing strategy of the TCIP relies on both risk retention and reinsurance. The TCIP absorbs the first $80 million of losses through its reserves (initially complemented by a $100 million World Bank contingent loan facility) and transfers excess losses to the international reinsurance markets. The government covers losses that would exceed the overall claims-paying capacity of the TCIP, which is estimated to be able to withstand a 1-in-350 year earthquake. Economies of scale are obtained through countrywide pooling of the risk and transaction costs, which results in more affordable premium rates.

1 4 6  S H O C K W A V E S

schemes have major advantages compared with traditional contracts: (i) transaction costs are reduced because losses do not need to be measured; (ii) individuals are still encouraged to take preventive measures since the payout does not depend on the losses or the actions taken to reduce risks (in other words, there is no moral hazard with index-based insurance); and (iii) the payment decision is simple and objective, making it easier to enforce contracts.
However, index-based insurance suffers from basis risk (that is, the difference between the payment received by contract holders and the actual losses they suffer). If the index is well correlated with actual losses, contract holders will receive an adequate insurance payment when (and only when) they have losses. But, in practice, the correlation between losses and payout can be low, because of wide variations in impacts from natural hazards and limitations of hydrometeorological observation systems. This means that people may receive a payment in the absence of losses, or receive nothing even in the presence of large losses--which would be catastrophic for those close to the subsistence level.
Despite its advantages, the take-up of index-based insurance is low, with several reasons being proffered (Brown, Zelenska, and Mobarak 2013; Cole et al. 2012; Cole et al. 2013). One is that basis risk plays a key role, because a low correlation between losses and payout undercuts the product's benefits (Karlan et al. 2012; Mobarak and Rosenzweig 2013). Another is that index insurance typically covers only one type of risk, while producers may be exposed to many (like price risk or supply chain risk). Other reasons include a general distrust in the insurance policy, limited financial literacy, and insufficient understanding of the product. The decision to purchase an insurance contract may hinge on whether the individual has had prior experience with it (especially having received a p ayout) (Karlan et al. 2012).

Overall, evidence suggests that the take-up of index-based insurance requires large subsidies, although, as with indemnity insurance, subsidies can make the schemes unsustainable (Brown, Zelenska, and Mobarak 2013; Cole et al. 2012; Cole et al. 2013).
Some of these obstacles can be removed by improving technology, policy design, and adopting best practices--for example, modernizing observation systems and improving index designs may reduce the basis risk and strengthen index-based instruments (Barnett, Barrett, and Skees 2008; Rogers and Tsirkunov 2013).
Social protection schemes are critical for helping people adapt and cope with shocks, but must be flexible and easily scalable
Against this backdrop of the poor being at a major disadvantage in terms of financial resources, it is critical that governments also provide social protection--that is any government program concerned with preventing, managing, and overcoming situations that adversely affect people's well-being. Social protection schemes can act as a crucial complement to formal risk management tools provided by markets. They also complement informal support from communities and informal insurance, which tend to be insufficient in the face of large or systemic shocks, and too often exclude the most vulnerable (World Bank 2013a).
The three main types of social protection are (i) social safety nets (also known as social assistance), which include conditional and unconditional cash transfers, public work programs, subsidies, and food stamps; (ii) social insurance, which consists of contributory pensions and contributory health insurance; and (iii) labor market measures, which include instruments such as unemployment compensation (table 5.1) (World Bank 2012, 2015a).1

Social safety nets can reduce the poverty impact of disasters and economic shocks
A growing body of evidence shows that social insurance and social safety nets are efficient tools to support poor people affected by disasters or environmental and economic shocks. In Kenya, the Hunger Safety Net Program prevented a 5 percent increase in poverty among beneficiaries following the 2011 drought (Merttens et al. 2013). In Bangladesh, the Chars Livelihood Program protected 95 percent of recipients from losing their assets after the 2012 floods (Kenward, Cordier, and Islam 2012). In Mexico, beneficiaries of Prospera, the national cash transfer program (previously known as Oportunitades or Progresa), are less likely to withdraw their children from the classrooms following a shock (de Janvry et al. 2006; Fiszbein, Schady, and Ferreira 2009; Gertler 2004).
In the short term, social protection helps mitigate adverse effects on livelihoods during economic crises (Akresh, De Walque, and Kazianga 2013; Handa et al. 2015) and disaster shocks (World Bank 2012). In Latin America, social safety nets played a critical role in helping poor people cope with the food, fuel, and financial crisis in 2008. In Mexico, the expansion of the Progresa program significantly mitigated the impacts of the crisis for the poor: without the policy

response, the incomes of those in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution would have fallen by over 8 percent; by expanding the cash transfer program this fall was reduced to 5 percent (Grosh, Bussolo, and Freije 2014). Similar instruments can help poor people cope with increases in food or energy prices (due to droughts or ambitious climate policies).
But social protection may be less effective at protecting against prolonged adverse trends, such as sea level rise. A background paper for this report explores how including nonpoor but vulnerable households in social protection can prevent them from falling into poverty. In the long term, this reduces the number of people in poverty, and thus allows spending more to support each poor person. (Carter and Janzen, forthcoming). The same paper suggests that there is a limit: if shocks become too frequent and intense, social safety nets become inefficient and livelihood changes are needed.
Social protection can support long-term transformations toward more adaptive and resilient societies if it does not lock people into unsustainable locations or activities
Poor people, with fewer resources, tend to invest less in preventing and mitigating adverse effects of natural hazards and

1 4 8  S H O C K W A V E S

environmental changes. In China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, wealthier households are more likely to take proactive ex ante adaptation measures, while poorer households mostly react to shocks ex post (Francisco et al. 2011). In addition, poorer individuals, lacking resources for long-term investments and proactive risk management, often rely on short planning horizons (Lawrance 1991). However, wealth is not the only determinant: policies favoring training in disaster preparedness and higher education can help both rich and poor households (Francisco et al. 2011).
Social protection and safety nets can support long-term adaptation to changing risks or environmental and economic situations. In Nicaragua, the Red de Protección Social cash transfer scheme greatly helped beneficiary households cope in the aftermath of the ""coffee crisis"" (coffee price decline); it also helped coffee laborers intensify alternative agricultural activities even before the crisis (Maluccio 2005). In the Philippines (see annex 5A for case study) and many other cases (Arnold et al. 2014), community-driven development projects can align the response to a shock, building longer-term resilience and empowering the poorest.
Further, countries with strong social protection can provide better support for workers transitioning from declining to growing sectors. The United States has done this with trade liberalization--typically through unemployment insurance for laid-off workers and wage subsidies in sectors that benefit to help them absorb workers from declining sectors. Studies show that these measures can mitigate most of the losses at a very small overall cost (Porto and Lederman 2014; Trebilcock 2014).
Social protection can also be used directly to facilitate long-term economic transformation. In Ethiopia, the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) contributes to increased resilience and climate change adaptation by investing in the creation of community assets to reverse the severe degradation of watersheds and by providing a more reliable water supply under different climatic conditions.

Social protection can also improve education and health levels, improving poor people's ability to escape poverty and adapt to environmental and economic changes (Adger et al. 2014).
· In Burkina Faso, cash transfers (conditional and unconditional) helped increase enrollment rates of primary and secondary children by 18 percent compared to a control group (families not receiving a transfer) and, in Chile, by 8 percent (Akresh, De Walque, and Kazianga 2013; Martorano and Sanfilippo 2012). Similar positive outcomes are consistently found for health, nutrition, and food security status of participants (FAO 2015).
· In Peru, women of childbearing age enrolled in the Juntos cash transfer program were 91 percent more likely to have a doctor-assisted delivery compared to those not participating in the program (Perova and Vakis 2012).
· In Ecuador, a supplementary feeding program more than halved child mortality in households exposed to the program for at least 8 months (Meller and Litschig 2014).
One potential drawback of strong social safety nets is that they can lower incentives for people to adapt and change occupation or activity as early as possible, when the first effects of climate change appear (Chambwera et al. 2014). If poorly designed, safety nets can even lock them into locations or activities that will become more dangerous or less productive. But then this challenge is not new or specific to climate change. We discuss in the next section the role of migration in poverty reduction, and the efforts made to make social protection a facilitator of--and not an obstacle to--long-term change and adaptation (Brown, Zelenska, and Mobarak 2013; Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014). In terms of design, the need to support long-term change favors the portability of benefits if the recipient decides to move to capture better opportunities (Gentilini, forthcoming).

Poor people often lack coverage, or amounts are too small to make a difference
Unfortunately, poorer households often have limited access to social protection and safety nets. One reason is limited coverage. Social assistance consistently reaches more poor than nonpoor people (figure 5.2, left panel)-- conditional and unconditional cash transfers specifically target poor households and are increasingly associated with good coverage among households in the bottom quintile (World Bank 2015b). But the two other types of transfers (social insurance and labor market policies) reach poor and nonpoor households in about the same proportion. This does not necessarily mean that those schemes are poorly designed; some programs, such as contributory pensions, are designed for those who can afford to contribute.
H o w e v e r, p o o r p e o p l e a r e o f t e n excluded from programs they should benefit from. Some programs are tied to formal

employment, whereas most poor people work in the informal economy. Also, poor people in remote rural areas can be difficult to reach. And conditional and unconditional cash transfer programs that have revolutionized social protection over the last decade are much easier to deploy in rural than in urban areas, given the challenge of targeting the poor in cities, where they often live next door to the wealthier (Gentilini, forthcoming). As a result, even social assistance shows a large range of coverage for poor people: in many countries, coverage does not exceed 50 percent, meaning that half of poor people within a country do not receive any social assistance, and even below 10 percent in many lowincome countries (figure 5.3).
Even when poor households are covered by social protection schemes, amounts received are often too small to enable better coping strategies. According to the World Bank's ASPIRE database (World Bank 2015a), within countries the average per capita transfer received by households in the bottom

quintile from social protection is lower than the transfer received by the four other quintiles (right panel of figure 5.2). In Malawi, the poorest quintile receives on average 0.5 cents per day, while the richest 20 percent receives more than 17 cents. In Vietnam, transfers are respectively 9 cents and $1.6; in Colombia, the poorest receive 23 cents per day and the richest more than $4.6.
After a disaster, amounts can also be insufficient when examining ad hoc schemes to support affected people. In Bangladesh following the 1998 Great Flood, 66 percent of households in the bottom quintile received transfers, compared with 33 percent in the top quintile; and 53 percent of the floodexposed households received transfers, compared with 34 percent of non-flood-exposed households (del Ninno et al. 2001). While targeting was relatively good, however, transfer amounts were small: they represented only 4 percent of total household monthly expenditure for poor households, and 2 percent for all households. Household borrowing highlights this limit: poor households affected by

the flood borrowed about six to eight times more compared to the level of government transfers.
Social protection schemes can be made more responsive
To help the population cope with shocks, disasters, and environmental and economic change, social protection programs must be designed for scalability and flexibility, especially for coverage. Moreover, they need to do so while encouraging adaptation and asset accumulation, without locking beneficiaries into unsustainable activities and locations. Thus, the choice of the right instrument is context specific. Cash transfers cannot ensure short-term food security if food supply is limited, making the case for dedicated measures for food provision in some emergencies (box 5.2). Similarly, it is futile to attempt to implement theoretically optimal policies if institutional capacity is weak in practice--using simpler policy tools may be more realistic, even if they are less

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 5 1

BOX 5.2 Food provision and school feeding schemes are commonplace and effective

The distribution of food is a common measure in situations of humanitarian emergency, following disasters, severe economic crises, or conflicts, even if it can distort local markets and reduce local production. During the food, fuel, and financial crisis of 2007­2008, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger introduced emergency food distribution and used cereal banks to sell food at reduced prices (World Bank 2015b).
Food distribution is also widely used beyond crisis situations. School feeding programs remain the

most common social protection and safety net system in the world (figure B5.2.1), even though they reach less than 15 percent of the poor, on average, in each country (World Bank 2015b). School feeding programs are efficient in times of crisis because they rely on existing infrastructure and human resources--schools themselves, as well as the teachers and parents who are part of school systems (Bundy et al. 2009). Moreover, they have the advantage of discouraging parents from taking children out of school in times of crises (FAO 2013).

efficient or less well targeted (World Bank 2013a).
While designing effective social protection can be a challenge, recent experience from social protection systems globally offers encouraging and valuable lessons. It suggests that countries at all income levels can set up systems that increase resilience to natural hazards. But, to do so, the systems need to be rapidly scalable in case of crisis and feature targeting mechanisms flexible enough to adjust quickly to new situations. Three key

approaches stand out: (i) increasing the amount transferred by an existing program to its beneficiaries or relaxing rules and conditionality such that the transfers increase; (ii) extending the coverage of an existing program to include new beneficiaries; and (iii) introducing extraordinary payments or creating an entirely new program (Bastagli 2014).
Increasing the amount or value of transfer. This works best when beneficiaries of existing social protection programs are those who are

1 5 2  S H O C K W A V E S

affected the most by the crisis, the shock affects primarily the poorest, and there is already at least one large-scale social protection program in place with efficient delivery systems for disaster response. An example of such a program with built-in mechanisms for rapid scale-up in response to a shock is Mexico's Temporary Employment Public Works Program (PET). Similarly, after Typhoon Yolanda hit the Philippines in 2013, external actors such as the World Food Program and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) used the preexisting Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) conditional cash transfer program to deliver their support to affected 4Ps beneficiaries--in effect, increasing the value of the transfer (see annex 5A). For some shocks, such as changes in food prices, indexing of social transfers provides a method for automatically adjusting the amount of transfers to a changing situation, without a discretionary decision (box 5.3).
It is also possible to increase transfers by relaxing program rules and conditionality. Disasters may make existing program rules unpractical or inappropriate: if a disaster destroys schools in a region, attendance is no longer an applicable condition for disbursing conditional cash transfers. In Colombia, the cash transfer scheme Familias en Acción suspended conditionality temporarily in 2008 to accommodate the shortfalls in service provision as a result of damaged infrastructure. In the Philippines, all conditionality linked to the

4Ps cash transfers was relaxed in response to Typhoon Yolanda, allowing the government to quickly release a total of P550.5 million (US$12.5 million) between November 2013 and February 2014 in temporarily unconditional transfers (see annex 5A).
Expanding the coverage. In case of severe shocks and those with heterogeneous impacts (such as a flood), even relatively well-off households may lose enough to be pushed into poverty--possibly becoming poorer than existing beneficiaries. To provide adequate support to such at-risk households, the program must be expanded to include the p eople affected by the shock. In 2008, the Mexican government expanded the coverage of the national Oportunidades cash transfer scheme by 1 million recipients to mitigate the food and fuel crisis. The total number of Mexicans assisted by the program reached 5 million households (one out of four families) (Demeke, Pangrazio, and Maetz 2009). In Ethiopia, the Productive Safety Net Program incorporates innovative features to scale up automatically and enroll additional beneficiaries when there is poor rainfall (see annex 5A).
Creating a new program. In the absence of an appropriate program that can be used or extended to respond to the crisis, it is possible to introduce new programs or initiatives-- sometimes, a disaster or a crisis even creates the opportunity to strengthen or reform the social protection systems. In certain cases,

BOX 5.3 Indexing as an automatic scale-up mechanism

Price changes pose a major threat to the smooth working of social protection schemes. Take, for instance, what happened in Kenya when food prices rose in 2007­2008: the Hunger Safety Net Programme's cash transfer scheme lost more than half of its value over 18 months (Devereux 2015).
To avoid such risks, many countries index the benefits in their social protection systems by using inflation data or the price of a basket of goods

and services. In Malawi, two schemes--the Food and Cash Transfers and Dowa Emergency Cash Transfers--adjust the transfers before each monthly disbursement based on observed prices (SabatesWheeler and Devereux 2010). Experience has shown that indexing works best when there is a contingency fund to absorb changes in the program's cost.

countries have used extraordinary payments. In Chile, the government paid a one-time bonus (Ch$40,000 or about US$66) in March 2009 to 1.7 million poor families to cope with the effects of the ongoing financial crisis.2 A similar measure was introduced in March 2010 following a major earthquake. In other cases, new durable programs have been introduced. The 1990 Honduran Programa de Asignación Familiar and the 2001 Colombian cash transfer scheme Familias en Acción were launched during recessions and macroeconomic adjustment periods--and transformed into permanent programs, part of the national safety net system. In Guatemala, the food and fuel crisis in 2008 prompted the introduction of a new program, Mi Familia Progresa.
But the challenge is larger when responding to a disaster or a crisis with immediate and urgent needs. Creating and rolling out a new program takes time--this is why countries with existing scalable programs are more resilient and better placed to respond to crises and disasters.
To extend support to new beneficiaries-- whether through an existing or a new program--it is necessary to be able to identify them rapidly. A challenge is to strike a balance between providing rapid support when needed and targeting precisely the most in need. Case studies suggest that the cost of a drought to households can increase from zero to about $50 per household if support is delayed by four months, and to about $1,300 if support is delayed by six to nine months (Clarke and Hill 2013). This rapid increase is due to irreversible impacts on children and distress sales of assets (especially livestock).
Thus, most postdisaster responses have multiple stages, with initial (survival-related) support delivered quickly even at the expense of targeting and accuracy, and reconstruction support provided later with more effort to target support appropriately (de Nicola 2015). In Pakistan after the 2010 floods, the government implemented the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), a rapid response cash grant program that included two phases to better

balance the urgency of postdisaster support and the need to carefully target the larger transfers supporting reconstruction (see annex 5A).
Postcrisis responses need to balance timeliness with targeting accuracy
In the aftermath of a crisis or a disaster, it can be tough to identify those affected and at risk of being pushed into poverty. There are several approaches to targeting beneficiaries, all of which face challenges (table 5.2). Economic shocks or disaster consequences are often heterogeneous, making geographic or demographic targeting approaches difficult (Alderman and Haque 2006; Grosh et al. 2008). Registries with socioeconomic information and precise location are seldom available--and, as in Nepal, there may not even be a reliable street address system. Usual targeting methods (like proxy-mean testing) are based on slowly changing household characteristics (like assets) and are slow and expensive to implement--meaning that they cannot capture sudden changes in income and consumption. And affected populations are often displaced in camps or with family or friends, and thus hard to reach.
Because these approaches will always have inclusion and exclusion errors, grievance appeal mechanisms are critical. In Pakistan, the grievance redress system in the second phase of the Citizen's Damage Compensation Program cut exclusion errors from an initial 61 percent to 32 percent (see annex 5A).
Options to manage this challenge include developing--before a crisis occurs--large and flexible social registries that include both potential and existing beneficiaries, the use of self-targeting methods, and the use of subsidies.
Social registries. These are crucial because they facilitate quickly identifying households that are vulnerable to being pushed into poverty by a disaster. Social registries should include demographic, socioeconomic, and location information on households that can potentially be supported by a social program.

TABLE 5.2 Methods for targeting beneficiaries with social safety nets are more or less appropriate during a crisis or after a disaster

Principle

Advantage

Limitation

Means testing and damage assessments

Benefits are allocated conditional on income and the presence or magnitude of losses

High level of accuracy and therefore appropriate in heterogeneous situations Can be adjusted after a shock, taking into account the specificity of the shock and the varying impacts at the household level

Costly (thus only appropriate for large benefits) and requires high administrative capacity It takes a long time to collect the data, so it cannot be applied for rapid response

Proxy-mean testing and damage assessments

Income and losses from the shock are proxied by quantifiable and easily measurable characteristics, such as ownership of a house made of bricks, or visible damages

Verifiable and objective, cheap because based on available data Able to capture heterogeneous situations, if proxies are well selected Captures asset losses from disasters

Focuses on slow-changing household characteristics (for example, assets) that may ignore income shocks Ignores large shocks that may change the statistical relationship between poverty and the selected proxies It takes a long time to collect the data, so data cannot be applied for rapid response

Community targeting

Communities eligible for support are selected, and distribution of benefits is then delegated to the head of a formal or informal community

Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster, based on low-resolution estimates of the impact (leaving local decision makers to identify small-scale needs) Makes best use of local knowledge on needs and priorities Can include nonmonetary dimensions of poverty and nonmonetary impacts of the shock

Works only in sufficiently cohesive communities, and may exacerbate social exclusion and affect authority of local actors Requires an estimate of communitylevel needs, often based on proxy-mean testing at the community level (leading to the same issues as above)

Demographic targeting

Benefits are given based on characteristics such as age or gender

Simple and cheap to administer, and usually popular Appropriate for supporting highly vulnerable groups such as children

Requires good demographic data Inaccurate when impacts are imperfectly correlated with demographics

Geographical targeting

The program covers only inhabitants of specific regions

Simple and cheap to administer Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster, based on low-resolution estimates of the impact

Appropriate only for large-scale shocks with relatively homogeneous impacts Unable to account for household-level vulnerability and heterogeneous impacts Performs poorly where poverty is not concentrated (for example, in urban areas) Can be politically controversial and limit migration and its benefits

Self-targeting

Mainly cash and foodfor-work programs

Simple and cheap to administer, as no registry of beneficiaries is needed Can be quickly adjusted in response to a shock or disaster Can be used to reduce risks (for example, public work programs that improve drainage) or to reconstruct after a disaster

Cannot be used to deliver large benefits and may stigmatize the affected population Inaccurate or inadequate if the demand for work exceeds supply, as the poorest and most in need are typically excluded Requires the availability of good projects, appropriate for the beneficiaries' skill set

In Brazil, the Cadastro Unico registry includes households with a per capita income below half the national minimum wage, a threshold that is higher than the income eligibility threshold of existing social programs. As a result, the registry includes households that are not currently beneficiaries of social protection but are considered to be vulnerable to economic shocks or disasters. Moreover, individuals can register at any time based on self-reported income, thereby reducing transaction costs (Bastagli 2009). Such a design ensures that the Bolsa Familia cash transfer scheme can be rapidly adjusted when shocks occur, thus acting as an insurance facility for vulnerable households.
Large social registries make it possible to introduce dynamic targeting, in which potential beneficiaries are segmented--before a disaster or a crisis--into multiple categories, based on their income, assets, location, or occupation (like farmers and fishermen). Then, the different categories receive a varying level of support depending on the situation. For instance, potential beneficiaries can be ranked starting from the poorest, and the number of people provided with support (""how far you go down the list"") can depend on the situation, for instance to provide more people with support during a drought. The level of support in each category can even be based on an objective rule or a weather index (like using cumulative rainfall or a trigger based on wind speed).
When social registries are not available, an alternative is combining geographical targeting (to concentrate resources in the most affected municipalities or communities) with community targeting (to use local knowledge to concentrate resources on the most affected households). Pakistan used this approach in the first phase of the CDCP after the 2010 floods, when timeliness was a priority and there was no reliable data on the distribution of losses. The second phase--less urgent but with larger transfers--put a stronger emphasis on targeting, using housing damages as a proxy for livelihood losses (see annex 5A).

Self-targeting. This approach, which does not necessitate much institutional capacity, can be done via work programs--which provide jobs and income by putting in place public projects (like road construction, maintenance, irrigation infrastructure, reforestation, soil conservation) or, especially in postdisaster situations, reconstruction tasks. It usually works by offering a below-market wage; people join only if alternative income sources are lacking (Cazes, Verick, and Heuer 2009). In Côte d'Ivoire, the Highly Labour Intensive Works Program was created to support and rehabilitate 35,000 former combatants via road building and reconstruction work. The key drawback is that works programs fail to reach those who face constraints that prevent them from working (like those facing disabilities, sickness, and exclusion) and who are often the poorest (McCord 2013).
The use of works programs as a social protection measure in postdisaster situations requires that cost-effective and socially beneficial projects be readily identified before a crisis strikes. In practice, however, extreme natural events, such as storms or floods, are typically associated with obvious and significant labor needs. Reconstruction of public infrastructure and buildings and the clearing of rubble are examples of needs that can be met by works programs, which can benefit affected poor and vulnerable people (even those with low skills), as well as the wider community.
Subsidies. These are widely used to help poor people, especially in the absence of other social protection programs, and not least because they can be simple and quick to implement. The Egyptian food subsidy program was expanded in 2008 to include 15 million additional beneficiaries (Jones et al. 2009)--thereby avoiding an increase in the poverty rate from 22 percent to 31 percent due to food price increases. Indonesia used a system of generalized subsidies as a safety net during the 1997 financial crisis.
But the drawbacks of subsidies are many. They can lead to waste and corruption. For instance, analyses of India's Public Food

1 5 6  S H O C K W A V E S

Distribution Program, which provides subsidized food and fuel, found a number of operational challenges--including underprovided entitlements as a result of ""leakages"" of food through the supply chain, commodities being diverted, food getting underweighted, beneficiaries being overcharged, shops being closed, and food falsely being declared out of stock (Drèze and Khera 2015; Government of India 2011; World Bank 2011).
In addition, subsidies are often difficult to remove when the crisis is over, and they are an expensive and inefficient tool for supporting poor people because in many cases a large fraction of the funds go to those who do not need them the most. Fossil fuel subsidies, for instance, are typically implemented and publicly justified with the rationale of helping poor people gain access to energy and energy services. But while low energy prices indeed reduce poverty by reducing the cost of energy services, they do so in an extremely inefficient way, since energy is overwhelmingly consumed by the wealthier.
Thus, it is strongly in the poor's interest to reallocate resources used to subsidize basic goods in order to implement better-targeted and more efficient support measures instead. Ghana's 2005 fossil fuel subsidy reform increased the price of transport fuels by 50 percent, but also included in-kind benefits for the poor--an e xpansion of primary health care and electrification in poor and rural areas, large-scale d istribution of efficient light bulbs, public transport improvements, and immediate elimination of school fees at government-run primary and secondary schools (IMF 2013; Vagliasindi 2012). Indonesia has introduced programs to mitigate the effects of higher energy prices through subsidized rice, free health care, cash assistance to poor students, and a one-year conditional cash transfer scheme targeting poor households with pregnant women or school-age children (Perdana 2014). Iran implemented a quasiuniversal cash transfer (about $45 per month per capita) when it reformed its energy subsidies (IMF 2013).

Building solid social protection systems requires resources but is affordable even for the poorest countries
Governments in poor countries face many competing needs and have limited resources, so the development of social protection and safety net programs needs to be justified carefully. Overall, however, costs are moderate, even in low-income countries--and instruments are available to help governments face the liability created by social protection programs.
Experience suggests the cost of social protection can be managed. For instance, a recent study assesses how much social protection would be needed to support vulnerable people in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel in 2030 (accounting for population growth and socioeconomic and climatic change) (del Ninno and Coll-Black 2015). It finds that-- assuming that vulnerable people can be protected against the worst effects of droughts with an annual social protection package of $300 per capita (the typical size of such support systems in the region)--1 percent of the region's GDP would be sufficient to cover this population, although more is needed in some countries (figure 5.4).
This would be a moderate cost compared with the cost of some short-term coping strategies, such as reduced food intake or suspension of schooling, which can have irreversible, life-long effects, especially on children. While such a social protection package can by no means prevent all negative impacts of droughts, it reduces the need for expensive humanitarian relief. In fact, the total cost of providing this protection to disaster victims in Africa during the period from 2010 to 2013 is lower than what was spent on humanitarian relief measures (del Ninno and Coll-Black 2015).
The government's ability to provide social protection to poor households will be greater if the middle class has access to instruments to manage risks, such as private insurance (box 5.4). Otherwise, the middle class is often better able to demand and obtain support from governments, at the expense of the

For the entire region, the cost would increase from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent, 0.76 percent, and 1 percent of GDP, respectively.

BOX 5.4 Private insurance and social protection schemes are complements, not substitutes

The different instruments for managing risk and coping with crises--from private insurance to unconditional cash transfers--are not substitutes: they are part of the toolbox available to governments, individuals, and firms, and can be used together, depending on the context and the considered risks. For instance, some tools can be more appropriate and efficient than others, depending on the probability with which a natural hazard turns into disaster. It is widely accepted that risk-reduction investments--such as physical protection against floods--are more efficient at dealing with frequent events than risk-sharing

mechanisms: one cannot insure against regularly recurring events. Similarly, self-insurance and risk retention will be preferred for some risks, while contingent finance, private insurance, and risk sharing will be preferred for rarer events. As a result, the optimal risk management strategy for a government or an individual typically consists of a series of tools, combined within a consistent and holistic strategy.
Moreover, the adequacy of different tools depends not only on the risk itself but also the varying characteristics of individuals and firms. While the middle class and formal firms can have access to private

BOX 5.4(continued)

insurance markets, providing insurance products adapted to poor people's needs can prove extremely challenging--for them, social protection schemes may be a more effective alternative to private insurance. Thus, protecting a population against shocks may require both developing a stable and competitive insurance market and providing social safety nets.
Well-established private insurance markets can be beneficial for poor populations, even if they lack

direct access: if higher-income households are covered by private insurance schemes, public funds for postdisaster relief can be better focused on supporting poorer households. In Turkey, the fact that all dwellers in urban areas are covered by an insurance product (the TCIP) makes it easier for the government to focus public resources on rural areas, which are poorer and where market insurance would be challenging to introduce.

poorer if resources are scarce. In two case studies on Thailand, it was found that the majority of post-flooding government support was benefiting the well off, with 500 Bahts per capita (about US$14) going to the richest quartile, compared to 200 Bahts for the poorest quartile (Noy and Patel 2014).
Scalable social protection creates a formal liability for the government, but contingent finance and insurance are available to manage it
Just how costly is social protection? Certainly, the cost of providing coverage to vulnerable people affected by natural hazards changes from year to year. In the case of the Horn of Africa and Sahel regions, protection costs can increase by a factor of four in a year of severe drought, compared to an average year (figure 5.4). For other (rarer) disasters or shocks, the impact on social protection costs can be even larger. In Bangladesh in 1998, households had to borrow at high costs to cope with floods, with long-term impacts on welfare and poverty (del Ninno et al. 2001). Avoiding such emergency borrowing would have required a transfer of approximately Tk 5,000 (approximately US$90 at the time) for each of the indebted households. For the government, total costs would have amounted to more than $1.5 billion (3.5 percent of GDP), a significant impact on public finances and social program budgets.

Managing such increases in social expenditures can be a challenge for governments who often face reduced tax revenues following a disaster (Noy and Nualsri 2011; Ouattara and Strobl 2013). To cover these liabilities created by natural hazards and other environmental risks, different instruments have been developed and implemented (Mahul and Ghesquiere 2007; Ghesquiere and Mahul 2010; HochrainerStigler et al. 2014; Cardenas et al. 2007). The optimal choice of instruments is country specific and depends on both costs and timeliness (Clarke and Poulter 2014). These instruments include:
Reserve funds. The Risk Financing Mechanism in Ethiopia is a fund dedicated to scaling up social protection, which allows the PSNP to disperse additional transfers to existing recipients or temporarily expand its coverage to reach beneficiaries not enrolled in the regular PSNP program, but who are affected by a shock (see annex 5A). In the Philippines, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund finances a range of disaster-related expenditures but is not able to disburse rapidly in the case of crisis; this is why the government created the Quick Response Fund, which focuses on emergency response (see annex 5A). Mexico's Natural Disasters Fund (FONDEN) was created as a budgetary tool to rapidly allocate federal funds for rehabilitation of public infrastructure affected by disasters.

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 5 9

However, reserve funds have limited capacities and cannot be designed to cope with the more rare and extreme events. In the Philippines, Typhoon Yolanda raised questions as to the adequacy of the Quick Response Fund volume and the process to replenish it if it gets emptied by a major event (or a series of smaller disasters). Thus, additional instruments have been developed to protect public finances.
Insurance and catastrophe bonds. The contingent fund FONDEN in Mexico now leverages private sector financing as part of a strategy combining risk retention and risk transfers. In 2006, FONDEN issued a $160 million catastrophe bond to transfer Mexico's earthquake risk to the international capital markets--the first parametric catastrophe bond issued by a national government. However, studies suggest that using reinsurance or international capital markets for financial protection can be more expensive than building additional reserves (that is, the opportunity cost of public funds) (Cardenas et al. 2007). Nevertheless, insurance products offer benefits in the form of fiscal discipline and timeliness of budget allocation. In emergency situations, these financial schemes are able to disburse funds rapidly--more rapidly than would be possible with public budgets. And by predefining payout rules for allocating postdisaster support, formal insurance and financial products can reduce political economy biases (Clarke and Poulter 2014).
Regional risk-sharing facilities. Regional mechanisms are also popular solutions. The Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) currently pools disaster risk across 16 countries. It was the world's first regional catastrophe insurance facility, using parametric insurance to provide participating governments quick, short-term liquidity for financing responses and early recovery from major earthquakes or hurricanes. The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) and African Risk Capacity are other, more recent examples of donor-supported regional mechanisms that

offer quick-disbursing index-based coverage against tropical cyclones, earthquakes, or droughts. In response to Cyclone Pam in March 2015, the PCRAFI provided Vanuatu with a rapid $1.9 million payment to support immediate postdisaster needs. This payout is limited compared with total losses and reconstruction needs--estimated at $184 million-- but was still 8 times the annual emergency relief provision held by the government, and 7 times higher than the annual insurance premium paid by the government of Vanuatu.
Contingent credit: The Cat-DDO. In 2007, the World Bank introduced Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options (Cat-DDOs), a new financing instrument allowing countries to access budget support in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. A contingent loan can be rapidly disbursed if a state of emergency is declared, and thus help governments finance the upscaling of social protection (see annex 5A). Cat-DDOs can also be used to back up an existing insurance pool, as is the case in Turkey (box 5.1).
Further, Cat-DDOs do not only aim to provide immediate liquidity. They also function as a mechanism to incentivize proactive actions toward risk reduction. To be eligible for a Cat-DDO, governments are required to develop ex ante capacity to manage natural risks. As such, it is the first instrument linking immediate disaster response funding with proactive engagement in risk reduction. Other institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency have since introduced similar instruments.
Cat-DDOs have proven to be an effective instrument for implementing disaster risk management strategies. However, experience shows that, facing a finite financing envelope, governments tend to favor cash in hand at the expense of contingent instruments. As a result--and despite strong interest from client countries--the uptake of Cat-DDOs has been limited. One option to improve access to contingent finance and build the resilience of developing countries would be to remove this trade-off between

1 6 0  S H O C K W A V E S

cash in hand and contingent finance by separating the budget allocated to contingent instruments from the budget allocated to traditional lending.
International aid. When a country's capacity to cope with a disaster is exceeded, international aid and humanitarian emergency measures can be critical. Foreign aid includes essential in-kind support (including emergency equipment such as emergency water treatment stations, reconstruction material, equipment and machinery, and emergency relief goods like food, blankets, and clothes), as well as financial aid for social protection and reconstruction costs.
However, in the past, increases in foreign aid have been low, averaging only a small percent of total economic losses stemming from the disaster (Becerra, Cavallo, and Noy 2013). Generally, studies have found that increases in financial aid are larger for more severe disasters and for particularly poor countries with limited disaster management capacities. This suggests that these resources are relatively well targeted and not politically biased (Becerra, Cavallo, and Noy 2013). Nevertheless, increases in foreign aid in response to disasters remain sensitive to media coverage, are hardly predictable, and can be slow to arrive--all of which make it ever more difficult to prepare contingency plans based on available resources. Foreign aid should thus be regarded as a resource of last resort.
To improve the timeliness, transparency, and predictability of postdisaster or crisis international aid, and provide additional financing, a special Crisis Response Window (CRW) was created as part of the International Development Association, the World Bank Group's fund for the poorest countries, in 2011. Its primary objective is to (i) provide poor countries with extra resources in a timely manner; (ii) help them respond to severe economic crises, price shocks, and major natural disasters; and (iii) return to their long-term development paths. In Malawi, the CRW provided $40 million of postdisaster support after the large floods that affected the country in January 2015.

Migration and remittances play an increasingly important role and need to be supported by policies
Migration plays a key role in the ability of poor households to escape poverty by opening opportunities for better jobs, higher pay, and better access to services and education. Migrants typically benefit from relocating, as do their families and areas of origin, through remittances, enhanced social networks, and access to information (Adger et al. 2002; Bryan, Chowdhury, and Mobarak 2014; Moser and Felton 2007).
Migrations help households adapt to and cope with shocks
Migration can be an important way of adapting to extreme weather events and climate change impacts, and thus of reducing impacts that lower welfare (Adger et al. 2014; Black et al. 2011b; Jülich 2011). Particularly in areas where in situ adaptation is difficult or extremely costly (such as in low-density coastal areas or remote areas with low productivity), migration can be critical. By migrating, individuals and households can reduce their exposure to natural hazards and increase the set of available opportunities, thus improving well-being and livelihood prospects. However, the poorest households have a lower capacity to migrate and may therefore be unable to use this option (Black et al. 2011a). This can also be the case for households in conflict and fragile areas, or those being socially excluded or marginalized.
Climate change can affect migration decisions, but migration is usually driven by a variety of pull and push drivers, both environmental and socioeconomic (Adger et al. 2014; Black et al. 2011a). In the past, direct environmental factors have generally played a minor role (Black et al. 2011b), except in extreme circumstances such as large disasters. The most important factor remains the socioeconomic context in the origin and destination

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 6 1

areas (Wodon et al. 2014). In the future, as the effects of climate change intensify, environmentally induced migration is expected to increase although no robust global estimates are available (Adger et al. 2014). A study investigating this question in five countries in the Middle East and North Africa region concludes that a significant deterioration of climatic conditions would lead to an increase of about one-tenth to one-fifth of current migration levels (Wodon et al. 2014).
Climate change and climate policies can also impede migration--whether through constraints on urban development and higher housing costs linked to natural risks (higher construction costs due to stricter building norms or restrictive flood zoning) or through increased conflict and exclusion (crime and violence or civil unrest). In that case, climate change would diminish the opportunities that individuals and households can capture. In addition, the ability to migrate depends on household assets (including land tenure), the ability to sell assets, information and social capital, financial resources, and human capital.
Given the importance of mobility as an instrument for poverty reduction, climate change adds to the rationale for portable social protection benefits (Holzmann, Koettl, and Chernetsky 2005; Kuriakose et al. 2013): safety nets that are linked to specific locations could tie poor people to places that may no longer support livelihoods. Safety net programs must thus consider the portability of benefits--that is, help households or individuals to remain engaged in programs and to maintain their benefits even as they move (Gentilini, forthcoming).
For portability of participation, in the absence of a central registry, programs require systematic tracking of beneficiaries. Some programs place the responsibility on beneficiaries to inform programs of their migration. In the Philippines, beneficiaries must declare a change in residency and notify the program six months in advance of a move. Alternatively, many countries have program offices in major urban centers where migrants can register upon arrival. Whichever strategy

is adopted, the provision of information is critical--both on the procedure of how to remain in the program and on the location of registration offices.
Modern technologies can help simplify access to benefits, at least when the program involves cash transfers rather than vouchers and in-kind transfers. The Bolsa Familia program in Brazil provides beneficiary cards that can be redeemed at outlets across many urban centers. A similar system exists in Ecuador, but with mobile vendors that visit beneficiaries. While effective and secure, such systems can be costly to implement at a large scale. Mobile money programs can be an efficient alternative, as they are typically low-cost and have a wide reach (Aker et al. 2014; Vincent and Cull 2011).
Domestic and global remittances are key to increase recipients' resilience
Remittances--that is, the private transfer of money by a foreign worker to individuals in his or her home country--are estimated at $584 billion in 2014. They are a vital resource for developing countries and significantly exceed official development assistance and foreign direct investment everywhere except China (Ratha et al. 2015). Fragile and conflict-affected countries, in particular, have large diaspora savings as a share of GDP: some 81 percent in Somalia, and 53 percent in Haiti (Ratha et al. 2015). In addition, domestic remittances can play an important role, especially in rural areas. In India, the domestic remittance market was estimated to be $10 billion in 2007­08, with 80 percent of that being directed toward rural households for whom this represents a large fraction of total consumption (Tumbe 2011).
International remittance flows are a stable source of finance that are generally not correlated with capital flows and that can help hedge against shocks (Bugamelli and Paterno 2009; Chami, Hakura, and Montiel 2009; World Bank 2006, 2015c). After natural, economic, financial, and political shocks, these flows have been found to either remain

1 6 2  S H O C K W A V E S

stable or even increase (Clarke and Wallsten 2004; Fagen 2006; World Bank 2006). Unsurprisingly, countries with a larger stock of emigrants as a share of the home population tend to experience a greater surge in remittances following natural disasters (Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha 2009).
Remittances can help smooth consumption and finance recovery and reconstruction. After the 1998 flood in Bangladesh, consumption was higher in remittance-receiving households (Mohapatra, Joseph, and Ratha 2009). In the Philippines, it was estimated that remittances compensated for nearly 65 percent of lost income after rainfall shocks (Yang and Choi 2007). Despite disruptions in transfer channels and financial services, remittances remained relatively stable after disasters hit Pakistan and Indonesia, and they were an important factor in recovery and reconstruction (Suleri and Savage 2006; Wu 2006). In Indonesia, households that received remittances in the Aceh region recovered faster from the 2004 tsunami, despite disruptions in financial services and informal transfer channels (Wu 2006).
However, international and domestic remittances tend to benefit the wealthier within a country (figure 5.5). They also have sometimes been shown to lower government spending through a substitution effect between private insurance provided by remittances and public insurance provided through government expenditures (Kapur and Singer 2006). But policies that encourage and facilitate the use of remittances for investments can also promote microsaving and microinsurance, and lead to cobenefits such as enhanced financial integration.
To support the positive impacts of remittances, adequate financial and banking infrastructure and frameworks are essential. Globally, the burden of transfer costs stood at 7.7 percent of overall transfers in 2014-- and they tend to be the highest in SubSaharan Africa, where they average 11.5 percent (Ratha et al. 2015), partly reflecting limited competition among service providers.

Sustainable Development has proposed reducing remittance costs to 3 percent, which would translate into savings of over $20 b illion annually for migrants. Commonly available technologies (like instant money transfers through cell phones) could play a key role in streamlining processes and reducing transaction costs.
Voice and governance
When it comes to adaptation and coping, the affected populations must have access to and some control over the country's economic, social, and institutional resources. Because poor communities lack human and social capital (like social networks and influence on policies and strategies that impact well-being), they are typically excluded from accessing such resources. A background paper for this report argues that only with inclusive and participatory decision-making processes

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 6 3

can policies be designed to protect the poor and vulnerable effectively (Tschakert, forthcoming). When such processes fail, as in conflict-affected states, governments may be unwilling or unable to support those affected, with poor people being the first to suffer.
Vulnerability to climate change interplays with many other vulnerabilities
Efforts to improve the ability of poor people to cope with climate shocks can be more effective if they address the broader issues related to power relations within societies, instead of narrowly focusing on one particular shock (such as disasters or changes in agricultural yields). It may be more effective to boost income-generating activities for the poor to enable them to afford living in safe areas, rather than to implement strict land use regulations that prevent destitute people from settling in flood-prone areas. Assessments of vulnerability need to go beyond analyzing physical assets and location, and on to exploring the structural drivers of poverty (like social capital, institutional arrangements, and governance).
Poor people are often confronted with multiple dimensions of inequality (including gender, age, race, caste, ethnicity, and disability), with implications for their capacities and opportunities to cope and participate in adaptive decision making (Tschakert, forthcoming). These inequalities can marginalize specific groups and further aggravate their vulnerability. In Benin, while progress in the multidimensional poverty index can be observed for most ethnic groups, no reduction in poverty was observed among the Peul, the poorest ethnic group (Alkire, Roche, and Vaz 2014). These types of inequalities not only reinforce systematic constraints to marginalized groups' access to opportunities, but they can also be a source of conflict that further amplifies the stress caused by climate impacts (Stewart 2010).

A narrow focus on poor people's vulnerabilities to climate change can lead to the justification of top-down interventions that undermine the role of communities (Tschakert, forthcoming). Adaptation strategies that fail to account for the needs and circumstance of marginalized groups (including women or ethnic minorities) can exacerbate risk dynamics (Vincent et al. 2014). In contrast, well-designed adaptation projects can promote equity, as in India's Karnataka watershed project--which increased income, employment, and agricultural productivity among the poorest participants (Olsson et al. 2014).
When social dimensions are disregarded, climate change and climate policies can systematically reinforce and exacerbate inequalities along with other drivers that amplify vulnerability. Gender impacts can be reinforced leading to differential access to social and environmental adaptation resources and exclusion from decision making and planning (Vincent et al. 2014). In Ghana, observations show that some husbands seek to maintain their power positions by preventing women from cultivating their own plots, even though it could compensate for yield losses due to shifting precipitation patterns (Carr 2008).
Overlooking local marginalized groups has major implications for the efficacy of climate policies and the ability of these communities to cope and adapt. Natural r esource-dependent communities--including indigenous groups-- often have extensive knowledge and long- lasting traditions for adapting to changes in the climate and environment, but are overlooked in policy-making and planning processes. These cultural practices are at risk of disappearing because of the effects of climate change on the livelihoods and identities of these communities. Other factors exacerbate this risk further, sometimes because of the dependencies created by policies, inadequate entitlements and rights, obstacles for intergenerational knowledge transmission, and the lack of inclusion in formal decision-making processes (Adger et al. 2014; Tschakert, forthcoming).

1 6 4  S H O C K W A V E S

Poor people need a voice in decisionmaking processes--community-based development and strong institutions can help
When poor people are excluded from governance and have no say in the d ecision-making process, the policy options discussed in previous sections are unlikely to be implemented in a timely and adequate manner. This issue is closely linked to the values and criteria that determine which segment of the poor population is considered ""deserving"" of support and the openness, inclusiveness, and fairness of the decision-making processes.
Decision-making processes matter. A cost-benefit analysis of adaptation investments would favor policies that protect higher-income assets rather than less-productive assets. Without an explicit focus on the poor and vulnerable, such an efficiency criterion may fail to help poor communities and instead concentrate support and resources on the wealthier. A recent study assessing impacts of sea level rise on U.S. coastal communities found that 99 percent of the most vulnerable populations in the gulf region of the United States live in areas where protection from inundation (such as sea wall construction) is not cost-effective, compared to only 8 percent of the most resilient segments of the population (Martinich et al. 2013). Protecting only areas where the benefits from avoided property loss exceed the costs of protective measures is a sure way of directing protective investments toward rich areas. Explicit choices to support or compensate poor communities are thus necessary to ensure that adaptation policies support communities with the least adaptive capacities.
And yet for poor people the ability to influence such decisions is often limited, thus contributing to their vulnerability to climate change and climate mitigation policies-- which, in turn, aggravates preexisting poverty (Lawson and Elwood 2014). That is why participatory decision-making processes can improve the diversification of coping strategies for disasters and help address the causes

of different vulnerabilities, rather than just their consequences.
One study, which analyzes how governance structures affect the variety of coping strategies for hurricanes in the Mexican Caribbean, finds that regions with less hegemonic political structures have developed more diversified coping strategies, compared to regions with strong top-down management that discourages participation (ManuelNavarrete, Pelling, and Redclift 2011). Another study shows that community-driven development projects have in various cases succeeded in helping communities deal with disaster and climate risks (Arnold et al. 2014).
In conclusion
This chapter provides evidence that poor people suffer more from economic and environmental shocks than does the rest of the population--and not only because they are more exposed or vulnerable to the impacts discussed in chapters 2 (agriculture and ecosystems), 3 (natural disasters), and 4 (health).
Another crucial difference between poor and nonpoor people is the strength and scope of ""support systems"" available to them: family, friends, communities, financial institutions, and the government. These systems provide tools for people to manage risks or cope with disasters and shocks (such as social safety nets, market insurance, savings, access to credit, and remittances). They are crucial for reducing vulnerability and adapting to changing environmental and economic conditions (World Bank 2013a). And they are critical for complementing other climate change adaptation measures--and preventing (at least partially) the associated harmful impacts on poverty.
The chapter calls for a comprehensive strategy, combining multiple tools that can protect against a variety of events (like small and frequent shocks, rare extreme disasters, and adverse long-term trends in precipitation)--and remain suitable and accessible for various income and demographic groups. For instance, developing market

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 6 5

insurance for the middle class to protect against relatively frequent events helps governments concentrate resources on the poorest and vulnerable people and on hedging against exceptional shocks that exceed the capacity of private insurers. While the private provision of insurance for the very poor is associated with large challenges, governments can provide quasi-insurance via tax-financed social protection schemes, and in turn reinsure against the resulting liability. But, for such protection strategies to be effective, they must rely on a good understanding of the benefits of different tools for the poor and facilitate participation in the decision-making process.
Now that this report has underscored the vulnerability and exposure of poor people to the adverse effects of climate change--and the various channels through which this can occur--we can ask what the overall impact on poverty will be by 2030. The next chapter tackles this question, along with weighing the implications of these results for climate change mitigation and its role in contributing to poverty reduction.
Annex 5A. Case studies of social protection and risk management in Ethiopia, the Philippines, and Pakistan
Ethiopia: Moving from crisis and humanitarian response to resilience building and proactive risk management3
Given the persistence of food insecurity in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia launched the Food Security Program (FSP) in 2005. The FSP was designed to institute a movement away from ad hoc responses to food insecurity--as characterized by a major drought in 2002--to a planned and systematic approach. It includes two programs:
· Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP): This is the primary program, which includes a Public Works component (builds community infrastructure and

agricultural assets) and a Direct Support component (provides social assistance to the poorest). · Household Asset Building Program (HABP): This is designed to empower rural households to increase their incomes, food production, and assets, by supporting livelihood activities, extension services, and access to financial services.
Households that receive support from these programs are expected to ""graduate"" from chronic food insecurity to food self-reliance. The FSP is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and is largely funded by international donors and financial institutions.
PSNP targets the poorest and fights chronic food insecurity.The PSNP uses a mix of geographic and community-based targeting to identify chronically food-insecure households in chronically food-insecure woredas (or districts) in rural areas. The greater use of c ommunity-based targeting has led to more participatory and accountable targeting processes. As a result, there is a general consensus among the highlands communities that the PSNP targets the poorest households. In fact, it is considered better targeted than any other African safety net program (Coady, Grosh, and Hoddinott 2004; Coll-Black et al. 2013).
The PSNP provides cash or food transfers, typically for six months each year, coinciding with the lean season (between June and August). The transfer value from the program launch in 2005 to June 2015 equaled 15 kg of cereals per household member per month, or its cash equivalent. Households with ablebodied adults contribute to developing their communities through public works activities (such as soil and water conservation measures, school room construction or rehabilitation, water point development, and road rehabilitation). Households with no able-bodied adults are considered ""p ermanent direct support"" households and are not required to undertake public works activities. The PSNP can also scale up in a crisis, by drawing on contingency budgets.

1 6 6  S H O C K W A V E S

Scaling up to ensure prompt, proactive response to crisis and humanitarian needs. The PSNP has various components that can scale up in response to shocks to support transitory needs. A key one is the Risk Financing Mechanism (RFM), which facilitates additional transfers to existing recipients or a temporary expansion of coverage to reach nonrecipients who are affected by a shock. The RFM acts as an intermediate policy response between the PSNP (addressing chronic food insecurity) and emergency operations. The process of scaling up has three stages:
1. Early warning triggered: The early warning system routinely collects and analyzes early warning data. When the early warning system triggers a response, a request for the release of funds is prepared and the RFM Management Committee determines the number of beneficiaries and length of support required. Through contingency plans developed at the woreda level, bottom-up needs are reconciled with available resources and funds are released for distribution.
2. Resource transfer: Funds are released by the RFM Management Committee either for transfer to the regions and onward to woredas or for food to be purchased, which is then dispatched directly to the woredas.
3. I m pl e m e n t i ng c o n t i nge n c y pl a n s : Although the contingency plans are woreda plans, implementation of most activities such as public works will be carried out at the ward level with technical support from woreda and sectoral experts. Normal public works procedures will be used. Notably, however, the RFM Guidelines provide an option to waive the public works requirements in severe situations.
The advantage of this approach is that it is early and preventive, rather than late and reactive (IDL Group 2009). The newest phase of the program, PSNP 4, involves measures that support a better emergency response by integrating with the humanitarian system more directly.

PSNP smooths consumption and protects assets in times of crisis. How is the PSNP faring? Biannual PSNP Impact Evaluations have concluded that the program is succeeding in smoothing consumption and protecting assets--even during times of crisis (see Box 5A.1). The transfers provided to PSNP households are the equivalent of 45 percent of annual food needs for public work beneficiaries, and 90 percent for ""permanent direct support"" beneficiaries. Moreover, while much of the cash transfer is spent on consumption, around 25 percent of funds are invested in productive assets. Further evidence suggests that the PSNP helps beneficiaries boost agricultural investments, leading to higher rates of agricultural productivity.
Although emergency operations are not necessarily less efficient than PSNP riskfinanced transfers at delivering food, the potential for greater cost-effectiveness lies in (i) the typically lower cost (though not always greater cost-efficiency) of cash as opposed to food delivery, alongside a range of other less quantifiable benefits of cash; (ii) the use of existing capacity to deliver; and (iii) the prevention of asset erosion and weakening of future household livelihoods with timely riskfinanced transfers, rather than lengthy humanitarian appeals.
PSNP explicitly supports long-term adaptation and resilience. As for concerns that safety net programs such as the PSNP can, to varying extents, be ""maladaptive"" in the face of climate change, the public works component of the PSNP and the HABP/livelihoods component are designed to explicitly encourage adaptation. Factors like soil erosion and water scarcity are being actively countered to make locales and livelihoods sustainable through regeneration. In fact, 60 percent of the PSNP's public works subprojects target soil and water conservation, strengthening both livelihoods and resilience to the impacts of variable rainfall. Together, soil erosion­ and water conservation­ focused PSNP projects have led to significant and visible increases in wood and herbaceous vegetation cover and a broader diversity of plant species.

BOX 5A.1 How the PSNP helped households cope with Ethiopia's 2011 food crisis

The risk financing procedure was set in motion following several successive inadequate seasonal rains and local crop failures--made worse by a sharp rise in food prices during the main PSNP transfer period. Initially, the cash value of the transfer was raised from 10 to 15 birr (US$0.50 to $0.75) for a wage day doing public works (and the same increase for direct support beneficiaries). Next, a detailed assessment was done for the size and distribution of a contingent risk financing operation (GFDRE 2011). It found that 9.26 million PSNP and nonPSNP clients in hotspot woredas would require risk financing support to meet consumption needs for up to three months between September and November 2011. It also found that risk finance payments should be provided as unconditional transfers to avoid payment

intervals built into public works transfers and to prevent households from neglecting agricultural activities during this period.
Over 80 percent of 11.1 million people identified as experiencing transitory food insecurity in 2011 were brought into the PSNP, leaving only 20 percent to be covered by emergency operations. Of the total 9.26 million people to be assisted from contingency funds, 6.5 million (70 percent) were PSNP clients and 2.8 million (30 percent) were humanitarian recipients. Since a total of 11.1 million people were determined to need transitory assistance in Ethiopia as a whole, this highlights the size of the potential humanitarian caseload shifted from emergency operations to contingency funding thanks to risk financing.

Philippines: A postdisaster response to Typhoon Yolanda based on existing social protection institutions and instruments4
Typhoon Yolanda (internationally referred to as Typhoon Haiyan) struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, costing the country an estimated P571.2 billion (US$12.9 billion) in damages, with over a million homes damaged or destroyed. Nearly 6,300 people died. A further 4.1 million people were displaced. It affected some of the country's poorest regions and was estimated to increase national poverty incidence by 1.9 percent, with estimates of up to an additional 1 million people falling into poverty. Given such immense human and economic consequences, Typhoon Yolanda provides an interesting case study on how existing social protection (SP) systems can be used to coordinate and implement postdisaster support.
The Philippines has one of the most advanced SP systems--backed with advanced information and delivery systems--in the East Asia Pacific region, designed to help poor households manage risk and shocks. The Department of Social Welfare and

Development (DSWD) is the lead agency for ""disaster response"" within the government's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Plan (NDRRMP). It also has responsibilities across the national prevention and mitigation, preparedness, recovery, and rehabilitation pillars of the NDRRMP. And it is the lead agency of four coordinating clusters of the UN cluster system--food security, shelter, camp coordination and camp management, and protection. As a result of this linkage of social protection and disaster risk management, SP programs are well positioned to respond to disasters.
From the emergency to long-term reconstruction. In response to Yolanda, DSWD implemented a variety of SP and social welfare programs: distribution of in-kind relief items, cash transfers (unconditional and conditional), shelter, and community-driven development. These programs are mapped out in figure 5A.1, illustrating the postdisaster phases in which each program was implemented.
Initially, the emphasis was on food and nonfood items (like mats, blankets, tarpaulins, hygiene kits, and clothing) to meet the immediate and urgent survival needs, plus temporary shelter assistance for displaced

1 6 8  S H O C K W A V E S

households. By end-November 2013, 375,000 food packs had been distributed, rising to 5.1 million by end-December.
After immediate survival needs were addressed, DSWD delivered a number of cash-based response programs, such as Cash for Work, Cash for Building Livelihood Assets, and cash for shelter (""Emergency Shelter Assistance"")--then transformed into the Core Shelter Assistance Program to rebuild permanent housing. DSWD also temporarily removed all conditionality of Pantawid Pamiliya Pilipino Program (4Ps), a usually conditional cash transfer program. In addition, at least 45 international humanitarian agencies implemented cash transfers (unconditional and conditional), partly delivered through the 4Ps infrastructure. Four agencies alone distributed around $34 m illion, benefiting 1.4 million disaster-affected people.
Over the longer term, the Yolanda experience has demonstrated the important role that community-driven development programs can play in the recovery of poor and vulnerable people from disasters.

The National Community-Driven Development (NCDD) program of DSWD was set up in 2002 to alleviate rural poverty. A contingent component of the NCDD was designed to adjust and simplify procedures in the case of disasters, triggered by the declaration of a state of calamity. Under this program, infrastructure selected by communities is being constructed (or reconstructed) in Yolanda-affected areas.
Integration of postdisaster support with existing social protection systems. In the event of a disaster, the 4Ps regular conditional cash transfer can be leveraged to deliver its cash transfers unconditionally, through the removal of grant conditions for beneficiaries in affected areas for a defined period of time. After a natural disaster, it is unrealistic to assume that beneficiaries can meet the conditions of the conditional cash transfer, especially in instances where the supply side may be down, with schools and health centers destroyed or being used for relief operations. In such cases, the DSWD Regional Director of an affected area submits a request to deem all beneficiaries in the

affected area as compliant to the 4Ps' National Project Management Office. If approved at the level of the Secretary, beneficiaries will be deemed compliant for a maximum of three consecutive compliance verification periods (three months). This is not an unprecedented procedure, with the Bolsa Familia program in Brazil having undertaken similar steps to deliver unconditional payments to beneficiaries affected by flooding in 2011. Using the preexisting 4Ps system in this way, DSWD was able to quickly release a total of P550.5 million (US$12.5 million) in unconditional cash transfers to Yolanda-affected 4Ps beneficiaries between November 2013 and February 2014 (DSWD 2014).
Considerable effort was also made to coordinate the large number of cash transfer providers with the government cashbased response programs--with some positive results. In the case of Yolanda, both the World Food Program (WFP) and UNICEF used the 4Ps system to deliver additional cash transfers to affected households. The WFP and UNICEF ""topped up"" the amount delivered by DSWD to households in affected areas, effectively scaling up the conditional cash transfer grant amount during a time of increased need for affected beneficiaries. This was an innovative and replicable practice illustrating the potential efficiency gains of delivering postdisaster grants through a national cash transfer program to pretargeted poor and vulnerable households. Finally, DSWD and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) also encouraged the humanitarian cash transfers to leverage existing social protection and other systems to increase coordination in their delivery, including:
· Disaster Affected Family Assistance Card (DAFAC) is the primary tool for monitoring the receipt of all benefits by affected households, including cash. It records basic information pertaining to whether the beneficiaries' houses were damaged (partially or totally), whether they are 4Ps

beneficiaries, whether they are vulnerable (like older persons or lactating mothers), and their estimated monthly income. Humanitarian agencies were encouraged by the government to adopt the DAFAC as their primary tool for monitoring their programs to increase coordination between the government agencies and humanitarian programs. · The Listahanan is a national registry used to target beneficiaries of the national conditional cash transfer program and other government social programs. In 2011, it contained information on 11 million households, but it is only updated every four years. A process was created for humanitarian agencies to coordinate with the Listahanan, thereby helping the DSWD to meet its mandate to increase the 4Ps coverage by 20,000 poor households affected by Typhoon Yolanda. · The 4Ps Beneficiary Update List (BUL) is a subset of the Listahanan. Updated every two months, it contains information on poor households (as identified using the Listahanan and a Proxy Means Test targeting method) that are also beneficiaries of the national 4Ps program. A number of humanitarian cash transfer programs directed assistance directly to 4Ps households using this up-to-date beneficiary information. · The 4Ps Grievance Redress System (GRS) is a component of the 4Ps that allows anyone to direct queries, clarifications, complaints, grievances, and appeals to the appropriate 4Ps committees at the community, provincial, regional, and national levels (UNOCHA 2014).
The extent to which these recommendations were adopted by the interagency humanitarian response remains unclear, and details on lessons learned are yet to emerge. Nevertheless, the potential value of a more unified overall response facilitated by preexisting SP information systems is clear, and further research into the streamlining of these information systems into future interagency response would add much value. Ultimately,

1 7 0  S H O C K W A V E S

however, post-Yolanda response documentation and reviews reveal that (i) there has been no rigorous evaluation of the impact of the overall response and (ii) there nevertheless appear to have been issues in coordinating cash transfer programs, leading to coverage gaps and duplication.
As currently designed, the postdisaster cash transfers are only provided to 4Ps beneficiaries and not to other affected households that may be equally or more poor and as or more affected by the disaster. A solution could be to implement a complementary but separate emergency cash transfer program, based on the 4Ps information and payment systems, that would be able to reach these households. This would create a more equitable and efficient postdisaster cash-based intervention while preserving the integrity of the existing 4P conditional cash transfer and its long-term human capital accumulation objectives.
Scaling up of social protection requires funding--while reserve funds were available, contingent finance mechanisms could also help. Accessing finance to fund relief programs through preestablished budget lines in a timely fashion is a necessity postdisaster, when the affected may be slipping into destitution by the hour. The Philippines recognized that response activities of the sort carried out by DSWD require immediate liquidity to be delivered rapidly, and that this could not be achieved quickly enough through the regular calamity fund--the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund (NDRRMF). The Quick Response Fund (QRF) was created to address this issue, with dedicated reserves for response activities. Nevertheless, the specific case of Yolanda highlights problems in sourcing financing from even the QRF in a timely fashion. It also raises questions about the adequacy of the QRF amount for a fiscal year's worth of disasters because, although the QRF may be replenished once emptied, that is a lengthy process.
There are a number of risk financing mechanisms that could allow DSWD to fund the grant top-ups in times of disaster,

including specific contingent financing or linking to the broader government risk financing strategy (like a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (CAT-DDO)). In this way, the Department of Finance would be able to utilize a proven delivery mechanism to better cover household level risk, delivering additional assistance directly to those most in need.
Pakistan: A two-phase window to balance urgency with targeting5
In July and August 2010, during the monsoon season, Pakistan experienced the worst floods in its history. The floods covered all four provinces of the country (Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkwa, and Baluchistan), as well as the autonomous territories of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). More than 20 million people were affected, with over 1,980 reported deaths. About 1.6 million homes were destroyed, 2.4 million hectares of crops damaged, and both farm and nonfarm livelihoods were severely affected (United Nations 2010).
Pakistan's main response was the creation of the federal government's Citizen's Damage Compensation Program (CDCP), a rapid-response cash grant program--rather than using an existing social safety net mechanism. Drawing on positive prior experience from the 2009 civil crisis, it decided to deliver the cash transfers through commercial banks, working closely with provincial governments and the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA). Selected program beneficiaries were issued Visa direct debit cards, called Watan cards, for collecting grants from ATM machines or designated points of sale.
Phase I of the CDCP focused on immediate support. In Phase I (September 2010 to June 2011), the goal was to provide quick assistance to families who lost their homes or faced a serious threat to their well-being. The program was funded by the government, which provided almost $400 million in cash grants to more than 1.62 million families

L end a H and : P oor P eople , S u pport S y stems , S afet y N ets , and I ncl u sion 1 7 1

(World Bank 2013b). Eligible households were given a one-off cash grant in the amount of PRs 20,000 (about US$213), based on funds available to cope with the urgent needs of a very large flood-affected target population.
The provincial and regional governments identified CDCP beneficiaries in two ways. A geographical targeting system was used in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. Entire communities were identified as calamity affected through notification by each province of the flood-affected areas (determined by visually calculating that at least 50 percent of houses or crops were lost). A Rapid Housing Survey was used in Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP) province and the autonomous territories of Gilgit Baltistan and AJK, with families living in flood-affected housing units, rather than communities, being identified as flood affected.
The findings from the Phase I evaluation showed that the funds helped households cover their needs at a crucial time (World Bank 2013b), with the grants mostly used for food, health needs, housing repair, and debt repayment (Hunt et al. 2011). However, the amount was insufficient for the floodaffected households to recapitalize their damaged or lost assets. The evaluation also suggested that for every 100 potentially eligible family heads, only 43 had received the Watan card. Inclusion and exclusion errors explain these results. Geographical targeting missed households that suffered from damages but lived in a weakly affected community; and the Rapid Household Surveys missed some damages and were conducted by local notables, not by experts able to detect all damages. Finally, the beneficiary selection and verification process proved to be lengthy and cumbersome, particularly for those who had lost the documentation necessary for verification either prior to, or during, the floods.
Phase II of the CDCP distributed larger amounts and was better targeted. In Phase II (June 2011 to June 2013), with total resources of around $600 million, flood-affected households, including many of those from Phase I,

were provided with cash payments that could be used to meet any recovery needs (like reconstructing houses, restoring livelihoods, or repaying accumulated debt). The size of the grant to eligible households was doubled to PRs 40,000 (around US$426), a more suitable amount to support recovery, provided in two installments of PRs 20,000 each.
Measures were taken from the outset to address the targeting issues found in Phase I. These changes meant that not all Phase I beneficiaries were eligible for Phase II support, and some people excluded from Phase I were included in Phase II. Housing damage was adopted as a proxy indicator for livelihood losses nationwide, rather than the geographic targeting method previously used in Balochistan, Punjab, and Sindh. This meant that the existing Rapid Housing Surveys could be used for targeting in KP and the autonomous regions, whereas new surveys needed to be conducted in the other three provinces.
The eligibility criteria were further refined to filter out the wealthier and to include particularly vulnerable households by adding two new eligibility criteria:
· Well-off households are excluded from receiving the Phase II transfer. Wealth is measured by a combination of proxies-- such as those having bank accounts in international banks, frequent international travel activities, and executive jobs.
· All legitimate vulnerable beneficiaries (defined as female- and disabled-headed families in the NA DR A's database) included in Phase I but not captured as head of household through the housing damage survey will, de facto, become Phase II beneficiaries.
The vulnerability characteristics of floodaffected families or households were profiled by analyzing a random sample from NADRA's flood registration database and linking this with information on gender, disability, and educational levels in the civil registration database (World Bank 2013b). Additionally, the outstanding legitimate

1 7 2  S H O C K W A V E S

grievance claims from Phase I were settled and considerable resources used to strengthen the government's communications, grievance redress, and policy and implementation capacities at different levels.
The new targeting mechanism was cumbersome for good reason--with fairly large transfers, the focus had to be on reducing inclusion errors and then addressing the exclusion challenge through a rigorously applied grievance appeals system that came to play a critical role in determining legitimate beneficiaries and drawing up beneficiary lists. Data suggest that Phase II has been reasonably successful in targeting the most severely affected and the most vulnerable households (like the poorest and least educated) in the four provinces (except Balochistan). However, beneficiaries experienced payment delays, with just 63 percent of households having receiving both tranches and 13 percent having received neither tranche--more than a year after the inauguration of Phase II and almost three years after the 2010 flooding.
Grievance appeals are standard features in safety net systems, and can be particularly important in emergency-type interventions, where often simple and straightforward selection procedures are applied within relatively short periods of time. They made for substantially improved targeting. Whereas initial beneficiary identification (the baseline) had resulted in the estimated exclusion of 61 percent of potentially eligible floodaffected households, with modified processes, and especially a fully operational grievance-redress system, errors of exclusion were reduced to 32 p ercent. Where exclusion did occur, it was driven by difficulties in capturing people without identity cards (who would be automatically excluded), those without a permanent address, very isolated households, and those living in insecure areas. Enrollment difficulties were encountered in particular in Balochistan and GilgitBalistan, where low administrative capacity in both areas, and stone-built, less flood- sensitive houses in the latter, resulted in few households being verified. Still, improved

processes reduced exclusion errors in Balochistan to 30 percent, compared to a baseline of 73 percent.
A model of beneficiary registration and payment. The CDCP offers a model of how to e stablish an efficient decentralized beneficiary registration system for a very large number of clients over a widespread geographic area. By the end of Phase I, more than 1.6 million families had been enrolled, and RPs 33 billion (US$374 million) was distributed (World Bank 2013b). A further 874,000 Watan cards have been issued since then and nearly RPs 31.9 billion (US$337.6 million) disbursed during Phase II up to June 2012 (World Bank 2013b). This is an impressive logistical and administrative achievement.
Over the course of Phases I and II, NADRA established 101 CDCP local offices, named Watan Card Facilitation Centers (WCFCs), covering all of the flood-affected districts. The WCFCs serve as a ""one-stop shop,"" where the beneficiaries are enrolled, register complaints or grievances, and often receive payments via a Point of Sale machine. Biometric screening is used to verify the beneficiary identities to prevent fraudulent claims. Beneficiaries are then registered and issued a Watan card, which can be used at the Point Of Sale desk or any ATM. In certain districts, the placement of a cash desk at the WCFC (like on-site cash storage) was deemed a security risk and payments have been processed at a local bank branch, usually one or two kilometers away from the WCFC.

6 A Window of Opportunity:
Climate-Informed Development and Pro-Poor Climate Policies

Main Messages

· In a pessimistic development scenario, climate change could drag more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030. This number can be reduced to fewer than 20 million, if rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development is combined with targeted adaptation actions.
· The impacts of climate change on poverty by 2030 mostly depend on development policy choices.
· Immediate emissions-reduction policies are needed to reduce the longer-term threat of climate change to poverty and avoid the post-2030 impacts on poverty that development policy alone cannot manage.

· To ensure that emissions-reduction policies do not slow down poverty reduction, countries need to focus on options that yield local (health or economic) cobenefits and protect poor people from the negative consequences of mitigation policies.
· In poor countries where domestic resources are insufficient to protect poor people, support from the international community is essential. This is particularly true for investments with high upfront costs that are critical to prevent lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (such as for urban transport, energy infrastructure, or deforestation).

Introduction
So far, this report has presented plenty of evidence that unmitigated climate change could become a significant obstacle to development and poverty eradication and-- maybe even more important in a risk-based

framework--that the uncertainty around the potential impacts on poverty, development, and welfare are extremely large.
Our analysis has been centered on the three channels through which climate-related events already affect the ability of poor people

179

1 8 0  S H O C K W A V E S

to escape poverty: (i) agricultural production, ecosystems, and food security; (ii) natural disasters; and (iii) health.
· Chapter 2 shows that losses in the agricultural sector and spikes in food prices pushed people into poverty in the past, as exemplified by the 2010­2011 episode that increased poverty by 44 million people--and that climate change will likely magnify this threat.
· Chapter 3 discusses how natural disasters are already preventing many households from escaping poverty, with the poor more vulnerable to these events--and how climate change is likely to worsen the situation.
· Chapter 4 shows that climate change will magnify the type of health shocks that are already a serious burden for poor people and poor countries--such as malaria, diarrhea, and stunting.
These chapters also identify many options to reduce the impact of climate change, especially on the poor and vulnerable--from dikes and irrigation systems to early warning systems, better connection to markets, and universal health coverage. In addition, chapter 5 presents instruments to make the population more resilient to shocks at an affordable cost for public finances--for example, financial inclusion and social safety nets that are scalable and can target people hit by a health shock or a flood.
The message that emerges from these sectoral and thematic chapters is that poverty is one of the key markers of vulnerability and that much of what is recommended as measures to make people and societies more resilient is simply good development policy. And, given that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissionsreduction policies have limited impacts on climate change between now and 2030, it is development progress that will be the key determinant of the impacts of climate change on poverty in the short to medium term.
How much of a difference could good development make to the resilience of individuals and societies? This chapter tries to answer this question--and for the first time,

to give a sense of the magnitude of the impact of development on the vulnerability to climate change impacts. But this report has also shown that there are limits to adaptation. The evidence is strong that climate change mitigation action is needed now to prevent much more severe impacts later this century (Fay et al. 2015; IPCC 2014; NCE 2014; OECD 2015). This chapter provides thoughts on how mitigation policies can stabilize the climate and the risks it creates, and do so without slowing down poverty reduction.
By 2030, climate change will increase; but rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development can minimize its impact on poverty
Between now and 2030, climate policies can do little to reduce the amount of global warming already under way because of the long lag between the introduction of mitigation policies, their impact on emissions, and the effect of emissions reductions on the climate system. Only changes in short-lived climate pollutants (like black carbon and methane) could have a rapid impact, especially at local scale, but their potential at global scale remains relatively limited (Rogelj et al. 2014). This scientific certainty means that the only way to reduce climate change impacts by 2030 is by lowering socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change--through both climate-informed development and targeted adaptation efforts.
We investigate here the potential efficacy of these development policies to reduce the poverty consequences of climate change (full results and technical details of the analysis presented below can be found in a background paper for this report, Rozenberg and Hallegatte, forthcoming). To do so, we first look at what the future could look like without climate change. We then use the likely impacts of climate change on the poor identified in chapters 2­4 to examine how the aggregate impact of climate change on poverty is affected by overall development progress.

The results are unequivocal: the impact of climate change on poverty is conditioned by overall development progress.
Even without climate change, very different futures can be imagined for poverty and development
It is impossible to forecast future socioeconomic development. Experience suggests we are simply not able to anticipate structural shifts, technical breakthroughs, and geopolitical changes (Kalra et al. 2014). Here, we do not predict future socioeconomic change and we do not predict the impact of climate change on poverty.
Instead, we follow a scenario-based approach that is the basis of all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. It consists of analyzing a set

of socioeconomic scenarios and exploring how climate change would affect development in each of these scenarios. These scenarios do not correspond to particularly likely futures (box 6.1). Rather, they are possible and internally consistent futures, chosen to cover a broad range of possible futures to facilitate assessing possible orders of magnitude of future climate change impacts. People sometimes refer to these scenarios as ""what-if"" scenarios because they can help answer questions such as: ""What would the climate change impact be if socioeconomic development followed a given trend?"" Our goal is to better understand how the impact of climate change on poverty depends on socioeconomic development, estimate the potential impacts in ""bad"" scenarios, and explore possible policy options to minimize the risk that such a bad scenario occurs.

BOX 6.1 It is possible to inform decision making, even in a context of deep uncertainty

We do not attribute probabilities or likelihood to our scenarios. These scenarios thus cannot be used as forecasts or predictions of the future of poverty or as inputs into a probabilistic cost-benefit a nalysis. That said, they can still be an important input into decision making. Indeed, decisions often are not based on average or expected values or on the most likely outputs, but instead on the consequences of relatively low-probability outcomes. For instance, insurers and reinsurers are often regulated on the basis of the 200-year losses (that is, the losses that have a 0.5 percent chance of occurring every year). And we buy insurance to protect ourselves against low-probability events that could have a large impact on our well-being.
Moreover, in a situation of deep uncertainty, it is often impossible to attribute probabilities to possible outcomes (Kalra et al. 2014). For example, we know that conflicts, such as those in North Africa and the Middle East, could continue over decades, slowing down growth and poverty reduction. But they also could subside, allowing for rapid progress. While these two scenarios are obviously possible, it is impossible to attribute probabilities to them in any reliable way. The same deep uncertainty surrounds

the future of technologies and most political and socioeconomic trends. In such a context, exploring scenarios without attributing probabilities to them is commonplace. Since the 1990s, the IPCC and climate community have used such long-term socioeconomic scenarios--the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and now the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)--to link policy decisions to their possible outcomes (Edenhofer and Minx 2014). Similarly, the U.K. government performs national risk assessments using ""reasonable worst case scenarios"" (for example, regarding pandemics, natural disasters, technological accidents, or terrorism), which are considered plausible enough to deserve attention, even though their probability is unknown (World Bank 2013, chapter 2).
While these scenarios cannot be used to perform a full cost-benefit analysis, they make it possible to elicit trade-offs and to support decision making. For instance, they help identify dangerous vulnerabilities that can be removed through short-term interventions (Kalra et al. 2014). In our case here, our two scenarios help us explore and quantify how poverty reduction can reduce the vulnerability to climate change.

1 8 2  S H O C K W A V E S

To explore how climate change could affect poverty reduction, we create two scenarios for the future of poverty by 2030, in the absence of climate change (figure 6.1; box 6.2).

Prosperity scenario. This scenario is optimistic in that it assumes that the World Bank's twin goals of extreme poverty eradication and shared prosperity are met by 2030-- with less than 3 percent of the world

BOX 6.2 Building two scenarios to explore the large uncertainty on the future of poverty

To build representative scenarios that are sufficiently differentiated, we first identify the potential drivers of future poverty--like demography, structural change, technological change and productivity, and redistribution--and explore the range of uncertainty for each of these drivers. We combine them to create hundreds of socioeconomic scenarios for 92 countries. This analysis combines homogenized household surveys (from the I2D2 database) and microsimulation techniques (Bourguignon, Ferreira, and Lustig 2005; Bussolo, De Hoyos, and Medvedev 2008; Olivieri et al. 2014).
We start from a database of 1.4 million households (representing 1.2 billion households and 4.4 billion people in 92 countries). We transform the population structure to account for demographic changes, and we modify the income of each household to account for socioeconomic changes, by 2030. We factor in assumptions on future demographic changes (How will fertility or education change over time?); structural changes (How fast will developing countries grow their manufacturing sector or shift to services?); technology, productivity, and economic growth (How fast will productivity grow in each economic sector? What is the future of technologies and their productivity?); and policies (How much redistribution will occur?).
Since evolutions are uncertain, we use a framework inspired by robust decision-making techniques (Groves and Lempert 2007; Kalra et al. 2014;

Lempert et al. 2006; Rozenberg et al. 2014), in which all uncertain parameters are varied systematically across the full range of possible values. This enables us to generate hundreds of scenarios for the future socioeconomic development of each of the 92 countries. Then, we select two representative scenarios per country--one optimistic and one pessimistic in terms of poverty reduction and changes in inequality-- and we aggregate them into two global scenarios labeled ""prosperity"" and ""poverty"" (table B6.2.1).
To guide the selection of the ""prosperity"" and ""poverty"" scenarios in our large set of possible futures, we use socioeconomic scenarios developed by the scientific community to support climate change research, the Shared SocioEconomic Pathways (SSPs). Our prosperity scenario is chosen such that it is consistent with the 5th SSP (or SSP5; see O'Neill et al. 2013) for population and GDP. SSP5 is the scenario with the largest economic growth and a small population. We also ensure that in this scenario, extreme poverty is below 3 percent of the global population in 2030. Similarly, we select the ""poverty scenario"" using the population and GDP pathways of the SSP4, the most pessimistic in terms of poverty and inequalities, and we minimize structural change, so that 11 percent of the world population lives in extreme poverty in 2030. Because of constraints on microsimulations, our scenarios have a 2030 time horizon, and we cannot use this tool to explore the future after that point.

FIGURE 6.1 Our model for estimating the number of people in poverty because of climate change (A schematic to represent the modeling undertaken to estimate the impact of climate change on extreme poverty in 2030 under different scenarios of future development, and thus in worlds with different levels of exposure and vulnerability)

In the absence of climate change, we can imagine two different ways for the world to evolve

Prosperity More optimistic on: · Economic growth · Poverty · Inequality · Basic services

Poverty Less optimistic on: · Economic growth · Poverty · Inequality · Basic services

With climate change, we can be more or less optimistic on the future magnitude of sectoral impacts

Low impact

High impact

There are uncertainties on the impacts, in the short and the long run. By 2030, di erences in the physics (and biology) of climate change and sectoral adaptation to climate impacts may give us di erent outcomes (e.g., on local rainfall patterns and
crop yields). By 2080, the level of emissions, and thus development patterns and climate mitigation polices, also matter.
We introduce climate change impacts from the low-impact and high-impact scenarios into each scenario without climate change (Prosperity and Poverty).
We model what poverty looks like in each scenario and then compare the difference.

population living in extreme poverty;1 that population growth is slow in developing countries; that education levels and labor productivity increase rapidly; and that the productivity gap between developing and developed countries decreases quickly. It also assumes fast globalization and technology transfers between countries, allowing rapid structural changes in developing countries and the reduction of the share of unskilled jobs in agriculture in favor of the industry and service sectors. Governance is good, and fiscal systems are efficient, allowing for high levels of redistribution. Even the most vulnerable populations have access to universal health coverage, water and sanitation, and efficient safety nets. And agricultural workers have enough market power to receive a large share of agricultural price increases if price shocks occur.
Poverty scenario. This scenario is pessimistic in that it assumes high population growth in developing countries and more particularly in Africa, low economic growth, and greater inequalities between and within countries-- with 11 percent of the world population living in extreme poverty. The world is assumed to be fragmented, with few technology transfers, low structural change, and in 2030 a significant share of the global population still unskilled and working in agriculture. Many near-poor people remain vulnerable and risk falling back into poverty if a shock occurs because of low redistribution levels and inexistent or inefficient safety nets. Health care and water and sanitation are not accessible to all, making the eradication of vectorborne diseases more difficult.
These two scenarios are counterfactual reference scenarios, which do not include climate change. In a second stage, we add climate change impacts into each of these scenarios. We do not attribute probabilities or likelihood to our scenarios because we are not interested in forecasting the future of poverty. Instead, we want to explore how the impacts of climate change on poverty are different in different development scenarios, with and without climate change, to inform decision making on poverty reduction and climate policies (box 6.1).

The effect of climate change on poverty is a combination of many sectoral impacts
In each country and for each of the two selected socioeconomic scenarios (prosperity and poverty) we introduce climate change impacts on food prices and production, natural disasters, and health, drawing on the results from chapters 2­4 (figure 6.1). In the projections of the 1.4 million households modeled in our scenarios, we adjust the income and prices to reflect the impact of climate change on their ability to consume, and thus derive the impact on poverty (box 6.2). The impacts are estimated using sectoral models (such as crops and agricultural trade models) and include adaptive behaviors (such as changing agricultural practices or trade patterns).
With a 2030 horizon, impacts barely depend on emissions between 2015 and 2030 because these affect the magnitude of climate change only over the longer term, beyond 2050. Regardless of socioeconomic trends and climate policies, the mean temperature increase between 2015 and 2035 is between 0.5 and 1.2°C--depending on the response of the climate system (IPCC 2013). The impacts of such a change in climate are highly uncertain and depend on how global climate change translates into local changes, on the ability of ecosystems to adapt, on the responsiveness of physical systems such as glaciers and coastal zones, and on spontaneous adaptation in various sectors (such as adoption of new agricultural practices or improved hygiene habits).
To account for this uncertainty, we define a low-impact and a high-impact scenario that represent the uncertainty on the magnitude of the physical and biological impacts of climate change. For agriculture, for instance, the difference between the low-impact and the highimpact scenario comes from the uncertainty in the global climate system, crop responses, and trade models that are used. For health, one difference across low-impact and highimpact scenarios comes from the uncertainty on the additional number of cases of dengue

A W indow of O pport u nit y : C limate - I nformed D evelopment and P ro - P oor C limate P olicies 1 8 5

and malaria due to climate change and on the cost of treatment.
There are several limits to our approach. First, we follow a bottom-up approach and sum the sectoral impacts, assuming they do not interact. We do not focus on the macroeconomic impact of climate change and its effects on overall economic growth--and thus on the secondary impact on poverty reduction, a limitation considering the evidence that overall growth is a major driver of poverty reduction (Dollar, Kleineberg, and Kraay 2013; Dollar and Kraay 2002). We do so because previous research suggests that the macroeconomic impact of climate change is likely to remain limited by 2030, and because we hypothesize that the main channel from climate change impacts to poverty is through the direct impacts, which are largely invisible in macroeconomic models (chapter 1). Second, we consider only a subset of impacts, even within our three sectors--for instance, we do not include the loss of ecosystem services and the nutritional quality of food. Third, we cannot assess the poverty impact everywhere. Our household database represents only 83 percent of the population in the developing world. Some highly vulnerable countries (such as small islands) cannot be included in the analysis because of data limitations, in spite of the large effects that climate change could have on their poverty rates.
Food prices and food production. Impacts of climate change on agriculture affect poverty in two ways, first through prices and consumption, and second through farmers' incomes (chapter 2). Higher food prices reduce households' available income-- especially for the poor, who spend a large share of their income on food products. In our scenarios, the impact depends on the fraction of food expenditure in total expenditure, and this fraction decreases as households get richer. Food price changes also affect farmers' incomes. However, this channel is complex since lower yields (which are expected in many areas because of climate change) mean that higher food prices do not necessarily translate into higher farmer revenues: the net

effect depends on the balance between changes in prices and quantities produced.
Using the data from our analysis of food prices and production, we change the income of all workers in the agricultural sector, according to the combination of changes in prices and in the quantities that are produced in a region (see Rozenberg and Hallegatte, forthcoming, for details). We also rescale the (real) income of all households, accounting for the change in food prices and the share of food in households' budget. The impact of the agriculture channel on poverty depends on the number of farmers in each country, the income of these farmers, and the income of the entire population (which affects the share of food in consumption).
Our results show that in the high-impact scenario, the number of people living below the extreme poverty line in 2030 increases by 67 million people in the poverty scenario because of climate change impacts on agriculture, and by 6.3 million people in the prosperity scenario. Thus, on average, the negative impact of climate change on yields and prices outweighs the potential positive impacts on income that will come from higher food prices. Those numbers are possibly an underestimation of actual impacts because both climate scenarios (low and high impact) assume that there is CO2 fertilization. The removal of the CO2 fertilization assumption could bring 3 million additional people into poverty in the prosperity scenario and 12 million in the poverty scenario.
Note that we did not model the impact of climate change on ecosystem services--even though those will likely have a strong impact on poverty--partly because the income derived from ecosystems represents a small part of the ecosystem's role, but mostly because ecosystem impacts remain impossible to anticipate.
Natural disasters. We estimate that the number of people who lose income as a result of a natural disaster is on average 100 million people per year (or 1.4 percent of the world population).2 To account for climate change by 2030, we assume that the fraction

1 8 6  S H O C K W A V E S

of the world population that will be annually affected by a disaster rises from an average today of around 1.4 percent to 2 percent in the low-impact case and 3 percent in the high-impact case. This is an increase of 40 to 120 percent, which is in the range reported by Bouwer (2013) and the IPCC (2012 and 2014) for the expected rise in economic losses. It means that between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent of the world population would be affected by natural disasters because of climate change, on top of the reference risk without climate change. Ultimately, these numbers will depend on the effectiveness and timeliness of adaptation to new climate conditions.
In the low-impact case, we assume that affected people lose 20 percent of their annual income if they are poor and 10 percent if they are nonpoor; in the high-impact case, the losses would be 30 percent for the poor and 15 percent for the nonpoor.3 These numbers are in line with postdisaster household surveys, even though much higher values are often observed (Patankar, forthcoming; Patankar and Patwardhan, forthcoming; Noy and Patel 2014; Carter et al. 2007). We also assume that natural disasters affect income only during one year, which is a conservative estimate that is valid for small disasters, but not for largescale events like Typhoon Yolanda in the Philippines or Hurricane Katrina in the United States.4
Our results show that for natural disasters, in the high-impact scenario, the number of poor people rises by 5.6 million people in the poverty scenario and by 1.5 million in the prosperity scenario.
Health and high temperatures. We now include a set of additional impacts of climate change on health (malaria, diarrhea, and stunting), based on the literature reviewed in chapter 4.
For stunting, we include the additional share of children estimated to be stunted because of climate change in 2030. To factor in development, we use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) by wealth quintile to explore the relationship

between household income and stunting. We find that the prevalence of stunting drops for families whose income is above $8,000 per year. We calculate the fraction of the stunted individuals in the families with income below $8,000, so that stunting prevalence is consistent with data for the current situation. Then, we increase this fraction using projections from Hales et al. (2014) to account for climate change. We assume that stunted individuals have lifelong earnings reduced by 5 percent (low-impact scenario) and 15 percent (highimpact scenario), regardless of employment sector and skill level.
For malaria, we increase the number of malaria cases in 2030 in each country following Caminade et al. (2014). As with stunting, we calculate the fraction of people who are affected by malaria, based on current prevalence, and we vary this fraction using estimates of future change due to climate change in various regions. Then, based on the literature reviewed in chapter 4, we assume that these people are affected between 0.1 and 2 times per year and lose income through the cost of treatment (between $0.7 and $6 per occurrence) and lost days of work (by the sick or caregivers, between 1 and 5 days per occurrence). Note that we consider only the monetary expenses due to the disease and do not model nonmonetary effects (like the cost of life or loss in well-being from being sick), which would be important in a multidimensional analysis of poverty.
For diarrhea, we start from data on the number of cases per country today, the cost of treatment (between $2 and $4 per episode), and the number of days out of work (between 3 and 7 days for the sick and caregivers) (Hutton and Haller 2004). We assume that the prevalence of diarrhea will increase by 10 percent by 2030 because of climate change (in all regions), using results from Kolstad and Johansson (2010). To account for development, we use DHS data to explore the relationship between household income and exposure to diarrhea. We find a threshold at $15,600 per year, and we assume that only households with income below this level are

A W indow of O pport u nit y : C limate - I nformed D evelopment and P ro - P oor C limate P olicies 1 8 7

affected by impact of climate change on diarrhea.
Further, we assume that fast progress in access to water and sanitation in the prosperity scenario would halve the number of cases, which is consistent with a recent assessment in India (Andres et al. 2014). Of course, this assumes that the new water and sanitation infrastructure can continue to perform well in 2030 and beyond--in other words, that development has been climate informed. For that to occur, the uncertainty in climate projections would need to be accounted for in the design phase, as would the extra funds needed to invest in more resilient infrastructure (possibly factoring in safety margins and retrofit options) (Kalra et al. 2014).
Our results show that the health impacts of climate change are severe: in the highimpact case, 28 million people would be pushed into poverty in 2030 in the poverty scenario and 4.1 million people in the prosperity scenario. The impact is smaller than that of agriculture for both scenarios but remains significant.
As for the impact of high temperatures on labor productivity (also based on results

presented in chapter 4), we assume that, in hot countries, people working outside or without air-conditioning will lose between 1 and 3 percent in labor productivity because of this change of climate, compared with a baseline with no climate change. To assess the number of people affected, we estimate the shares of people working outside or without air-conditioning in the two socioeconomic scenarios. We find that with high climate change impacts, 19 million people would be pushed into poverty in 2030 in the poverty scenario, and 2.7 million people in the prosperity scenario because of the impact of temperature.
Comparing sectoral influences. Which of these sectors has the greatest impact on poverty in our simulations? As figure 6.2 illustrates, agricultural impacts are the chief culprit in all four scenarios (prosperity and poverty, combined with high and low impacts). Next come health impacts (diarrhea, malaria, and stunting), and the labor productivity effects of high temperature with a second-order but significant role. Disasters play a limited role, but we have to be careful because only the direct impact of income losses was accounted for.

By 2030, climate change is not the dominant driver of global poverty but can have a large impact if development is not rapid, inclusive, and climate informed
So how do these sectoral results add up in terms of climate change's effect on future poverty trends? We definitely find that a large effect on poverty is possible, even though our analysis is partial and does not include many other possible impacts (for example through tourism, energy prices, foreign direct investment, or remittances) and looks only at the short term (during which there will be small changes in climate conditions compared with what unabated climate change could bring over the long term). Indeed, our overall results show that between 3 million (in the prosperity scenario with low impact) and 122 million (in the poverty scenario with high impact) additional people would be in poverty because of climate change (Table 6.1).
· In the poverty scenario, the total number of people living below the extreme poverty line in 2030 is 1.02 billion people in the high-impact climate change scenario; this represents an increase of 122 million people compared to a scenario with no climate change. For the low-impact scenario, the increase is 35 million people.

· In the prosperity scenario, the increase in poverty due to a high-impact climate change scenario is ""only"" 16 million people, suggesting that development and access to basic services (like water and sanitation) are effective in reducing poor people's vulnerability to climate change. For the low-impact scenario, the increase is 3 million people.
Note that the large range of estimates in our results--3 to 122 million--may incorrectly suggest that we cannot say anything about the future impact of climate change on poverty. The reason for this rather wide range is not just scientific uncertainty on climate change and its impacts. Instead, it is predominantly policy choices--particularly those concerning development patterns and poverty reduction policies between now and 2030. While emissions-reduction policies cannot do much regarding the climate change that will happen between now and 2030 (since that is mostly the result of past emissions), development choices can affect what the impact of that climate change will be.
In the prosperity scenario, the lower impact of climate change on poverty comes from a reduced vulnerability of the developing world to climate change compared to the poverty scenario. This reduced vulnerability, in turn, stems from several channels.

· People are richer and fewer households live with a daily income close to the poverty line. Wealthier people are less exposed to health shocks (such as stunting and diarrhea) and are less likely to be pushed into poverty when hit by a shock.
· The global population is smaller in the prosperity scenario in 2030, by 2 percent globally, 4 percent in the developing world, and 10 to 20 percent in most African countries. This difference in population makes it easier for global food production to meet demand, thereby mitigating the impact of climate change on global food prices. The prosperity scenario also assumes more technology transfers to developing countries, which further mitigates agricultural losses.
· There is more structural change (involving shifts from unskilled agricultural jobs to skilled manufacturing and service jobs), so fewer workers are vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on yields. In the prosperity scenario, a more balanced economy and better governance mean that farmers capture a larger share of the income benefits from higher food prices.
Up to 2030, climate change remains a secondary driver of global poverty compared to development: the difference across reference scenarios due to socioeconomic trends and policies (that is, the difference between the poverty and prosperity scenarios in the absence of climate change) is almost 800 million people. This does not mean that climate change impacts are secondary at the local scale: in some particularly vulnerable places (like small islands or in unlucky locations affected by large disasters), the local impact could be massive.
Note that although climate change impacts are secondary in our scenarios, they are also highly uncertain. There is a big difference in poverty outcomes when we consider climate change in the low-impact or high-impact scenario. This occurs because of the large uncertainty surrounding the future magnitude of physical impacts, largely in agriculture. In fact, a systematic sensitivity analysis based on

our model shows that almost 90 percent of the uncertainty on poverty impacts arises from the uncertainty on the local agriculture impacts (like how crops respond to higher temperatures and resulting impact on yields), which is due to the different climate models used in the agricultural analysis (chapter 2).
This uncertainty prevents us from providing a precise estimate of the future impacts of climate change on poverty, even for a given socioeconomic development trend. And the present analysis underestimates this uncertainty since many of the least-known impacts have been disregarded--such as recent findings of the impact of climate change on the nutritional quality of food (Myers et al. 2014), or the possibility of a more rapid rise in sea level than expected.
Since most of the variation in our estimate of the climate change impact on poverty arises from the socioeconomic trends and policies, we explore this variation further and use 60 alternative prosperity and 60 alternative poverty scenarios. These scenarios represent different world evolutions that achieve similar progress to the two reference scenarios in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction. We assess the poverty impacts of climate change on all 120 scenarios. We find that the range of possible impacts is extremely large, especially in the poverty scenario (table 6.1)-- which also features more uncertainty. In the poverty scenario, some scenarios (12 out of 60) show a decrease in global poverty numbers. These are scenarios where climate change impacts remain moderate (lowimpact), where a large share of the population still works in the agricultural sector, and where farmers benefit the most from higher food prices (assuming a proportional passthrough of higher revenues to their incomes).
Our global results in the representative prosperity and poverty scenarios also hide higher impacts at a finer scale. At the country and regional level, the hotspots for increased poverty because of climate change are SubSaharan Africa and--to a lesser extent--India and the rest of South Asia, especially in the poverty scenario (map 6.1). Those countries, in Africa in particular, bear a higher burden

because they have the highest initial number of poor people and the steepest projected food price increases.
In almost all countries, the additional number of poor people due to climate change is higher in the poverty scenario than in the prosperity scenario. Two exceptions are Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, for which the number of poor people pushed into poverty because of climate change is higher in the prosperity scenario than in the poverty scenario. This is because, in the poverty scenario, 70 percent of the population still lives below the extreme poverty threshold in 2030 even without climate change. There are fewer people at risk of falling into poverty because most of the population is already poor--a reminder that the depth of poverty (not just the poverty headcount) also matters.
Moreover, our results show that it is not just the extreme poor who are affected. By 2030, the income of the bottom 40 percent is reduced compared to the scenarios without climate change by more than 4 percent in many countries in the high-impact climate change scenario. In most Sub-Saharan African countries and Pakistan, the income of the bottom 40 percent decreases by more than 8 percent in the high-impact climate change scenario.
What messages should we take away from all of these results?
First, the quantitative impacts of climate change on poverty are uncertain, but could be significant, even over the relatively short term. It is true that our analysis does not cover all climate change impacts (like those on ecosystem services) or the entire developing country population (17 percent is left out), yet we still find that more than 100 m illion people may be pushed into poverty because of climate change impacts.
Second, most of the uncertainty surrounding these impacts comes from development choices made between now and 2030, and can therefore be actively reduced by implementing the right policies. The quantitative impacts of climate change on poverty are much smaller in a world where socioeconomic trends and policies ensure that

development is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed, than in a world where extreme poverty would persist without climate change. Development policies thus appear to be good adaptation policies, in addition to the more targeted sectoral interventions described in previous chapters.
Pro-poor mitigation policies are needed to reduce the long-term threat of climate change
So far, we have looked only at what occurs by 2030--a period during which emissionsreduction policies have almost no impact on the magnitude of climate change (IPCC 2013). By this time, climate change impacts also remain moderate compared with what is expected in 2050 and beyond. Indeed, the impacts of climate change will grow with its magnitude, which will continue increasing as long as net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are not reduced to zero.
While chapters 2 to 5 propose options to reduce these impacts, they also point to the limits of these options. Land use planning faces difficult political economy obstacles, financial constraints make it tough to invest in protection infrastructure, the provision of health care in rural areas remains challenging, and targeting social assistance after a disaster and in emergency conditions will always be difficult. There are clear limits to what adaptation can achieve, and these limits will be tested by climate change. As summarized in IPCC (2014), ""without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally.""
Moreover, the long-term impacts of climate change are highly uncertain. How will ecosystems react to rapid changes in temperature, rainfall, and ocean acidity? How fast will icecaps disappear, raising global sea levels and threatening coastal settlements? Could more pressure on natural resources trigger more conflicts? Importantly, this

1 9 2  S H O C K W A V E S

uncertainty is skewed toward catastrophic outcomes: while climate change impacts might turn out to be moderate, they could escalate to extremely high levels and in that case--again--poor people would be the most affected (Pindyck 2013; Stern 2013; Weitzman 2014).
Thus, uncertainty is not a reason to delay climate change mitigation action. On the contrary, the need for climate stabilization arises from a risk management approach that takes into account threats created by long-term impacts and the fact that GHG emissions lock us into irreversible warming. These risks-- that remain impossible to quantify in terms of consequences or probability--largely explain why the international community has committed to the goal of stabilizing global temperature (16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC 2010), and thus to the full decarbonization of the global economy (Fay et al. 2015; G7 2015).
Climate stabilization requires immediate departure from current development trends
What might a mitigation game plan look like? To begin with, there is agreement that current development trends are incompatible with the internationally agreed climate targets (IPCC 2014). Energy consumption, the main driver of GHG emissions worldwide, is expected to increase over time in a development-as-usual scenario--reflecting the huge income gaps among regions and countries.
Typically, very poor, agriculture-focused countries do not consume a lot of energy. In 2011, the 900 million persons (13 percent of the population) living in the 50 poorest countries emitted only 0.8 percent of global CO2 emissions (figure 6.3). Indeed, below about $5,000 GDP per capita, increases in income tend to result in only modest increases in energy consumption (figure 6.4). But, beyond this threshold, a major factor in development has been industrialization, which comes with a tighter link between GDP growth and energy consumption growth. And energy is required to fuel hospitals, schools,

transportation, and other productive activities that support development. At high-income levels (above about $10,000 per capita), economies and growth diversify away from manufacturing, and energy consumption increases more slowly with income (Medlock III and Soligo 2001; van Benthem 2015).
Looking ahead, can this relationship change through energy leapfrogging? Thanks to technological progress, the energy efficiency of lighting, vehicles, appliances, and industrial processes has improved considerably in the past decades. This means that, when countries that are currently less developed reach the income per capita levels that today's developed countries had, say in the 1960s, they will have access to more energy-efficient technology than was available for developed c ountries at that time. Will this reduce energy consumption associated with future development? So far, there is no evidence of leapfrogging: economic development has not been less energy intensive in follower, developing countries than past growth in leader, now-developed countries. Three factors can explain this result (van Benthem 2015).
First, developing countries may not fully adopt available efficient technology because their regulations are less stringent, access to technologies remains limited by trade barriers and skill mismatch, and governments investing in infrastructure and firms investing in productive capital face strong constraints in terms of access to capital and financial markets (Fay et al. 2015; World Bank 2012). As a result, they typically favor technologies with lower upfront capital costs, in effect, favoring less energy-efficient technology.
Second, globalization and outsourcing mean that developing countries today are manufacturing not just for themselves, as developed countries did during their development, but also for the developed world. Their economy thus relies relatively more on manufacturing for exports, which tends to increase energy consumption.
Third, more efficient technology is offset by increased use of such technology (Gertler et al. 2013; Gillingham et al. 2013). Developing countries may use more (or larger) cars and refrigerators than developed

A W indow of O pport u nit y : C limate - I nformed D evelopment and P ro - P oor C limate P olicies 1 9 3

countries in the past at similar income levels-- this earlier access of poor people to energy services is one of the positive impacts of higher energy efficiency, but it results in more energy consumption.
Energy leapfrogging could occur in the future if (i) developing countries enact policies that favor the adoption of cleaner technologies (like performance standards on light bulbs, appliances, buildings, or private vehicles); (ii) they correct other market or government failures that prevent technology adoption (like mandating labels that inform on energy consumption, or removing energy subsidies); (iii) manufacturing patterns become more balanced (for instance if developed countries increasingly use robots to manufacture locally); or (iv) technology adoption in developing countries saturates at lower levels than in developed countries (car ownership may end up being lower in developing countries than in already developed countries if developing countries build mass transit­ oriented cities). But the evidence suggests that energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves.
Policies are thus needed to make development and climate change stabilization compatible. Energy consumption and related emissions are unlikely to decrease by themselves, and maintaining global warming below 2°C, or even below 3°C, will require reducing emissions to zero by 2100 (figure 6.5). Modern living standards will thus need to be supported in a more efficient and radically less carbon-intensive way, and residual emissions offset though natural carbon sinks like forests (Fay et al. 2015).
With this goal in mind, it makes economic sense for all countries to account for the carbon constraint, especially in decisions with long-term consequences, and to drive their development toward efficient patterns (Fay et al. 2015; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2014; World Bank 2012). If the carbon constraint is not accounted for now, development will create lock-ins into energy- and carbon-intensive patterns--such as inefficient urban forms (Avner, Hallegatte, and Rentschler 2014), insufficient investment in public transport (Vogt-Schilb, Hallegatte, and de Gouvello

2014), or insufficient investment in zero- carbon electricity (Lecuyer and Vogt-Schilb 2014). Without early retirement, the lifetime of energy infrastructure that is built now ranges

from 20 to 60 years, in effect creating an ""emission commitment"" (Davis, Caldeira, and Matthews 2010; Davis and Socolow 2014; Guivarch and Hallegatte 2011). This commitment is rapidly increasing today, especially because much coal-related infrastructure continues to be built across the world (figure 6.6) (Steckel, Edenhofer, and Jakob 2015).
These carbon-intensive patterns would be costly--or sometimes impossible--to reverse later on, which would impair an efficient transition toward a zero-carbon economy and make it much more expensive and politically difficult (Rozenberg, Vogt-Schilb, and Hallegatte 2014). Thus, it is urgent that all countries--especially developing ones that are building their infrastructure stocks at present-- take steps to redirect investment in long-lived capital and infrastructure toward low- or zero-emission alternatives.
To achieve an efficient decarbonization of the world economy, all countries must work on enacting comprehensive packages of mitigation policies (IPCC 2014)--ranging from carbon pricing and innovation support to

environmental performance standards, information labels, financing facilities, and land use and urban planning (Fay et al. 2015; NCE 2014; OECD 2015). These packages must be designed in a way that does not threaten the objective of eradicating poverty by 2030.
Climate change mitigation need not slow down poverty alleviation, as long as climate mitigation policies are done right
What would such ambitious mitigation policies portend for poverty reduction? They could reduce GDP growth, in turn slowing down poverty reduction. Higher energy prices (due to more expensive low-carbon energy technologies) could reduce poor p eople's consumption, as would higher food prices (due to land use for bioenergy or carbon sequestration).
However, reviews of modeling exercises suggest that mitigation policies would not lead to large losses in this area, even without considering benefits from lower climate change impacts and cobenefits. The IPCC (2014) estimates that mitigation policies would reduce global consumption by 1­4 p ercent in 2030 and 3­11 percent in 2100 relative to an expected consumption growth of more than 300 percent in all scenarios. But these limited costs at the global scale remain uncertain and heatedly debated; models still neglect many mechanisms that could magnify these losses, such as imperfections in labor markets. More important, global estimates hide large impacts on certain countries or sectors.
Even so, policy makers can design climatemitigation policies that do not threaten poverty eradication. This can be done in three ways: (i) building on no-regret options and focusing on local and immediate cobenefits; (ii) protecting the poor and vulnerable populations against adverse consequences of costly emissions reduction options; and (iii) in the poorest countries, using support from the international community to offset potential trade-offs between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation--especially for the

A W indow of O pport u nit y : C limate - I nformed D evelopment and P ro - P oor C limate P olicies 1 9 5

options that involve immediate costs but are urgently needed to prevent irreversibility and lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (like those regarding deforestation or urban transport).
Climate change mitigation offers cost-effective opportunities and cobenefits, especially for poor people. Many climate mitigation policies are consistent with development objectives and contribute to higher productivity and efficiency (Fay et al. 2015; World Bank 2012, 2014a). In other words, sometimes the most effective development options also reduce GHGs emissions (or increase them in a negligible manner; see box 6.3).
For instance, using modern, e nergy-efficient technologies for lightning and transportation can help provide cheap energy services at a low environmental and economic cost. The Global Fuel Economy Initiative's (GFEI) goal of doubling the efficiency of the global fleet of cars (from 8 to 4 liters per 100 km) would result in savings in annual oil import bills alone worth over $300 billion in 2025 and $600 billion in 2050 (based on an oil price of $100/barrel). According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/ Global Environment Facility (GEF) en.lighten initiative, eliminating inefficient lighting by 2030 would save about 1,000 terawatt-hour (TWh)/year in electricity consumption and more than $100 billion in electricity bills.
Also, renewable energy can meet the needs of poor households at competitive prices, especially in remote rural areas where grid development and centralized production would be expensive (Deichmann et al. 2011). Under the World Bank­managed Community Development Carbon Fund Nepal Micro-Hydro Promotion project, 426 community-run micro-hydropower plants were installed, benefitting 625,000 people and avoiding the emissions of about 66,000 tons of CO2 per year.
In addition, climate mitigation efforts can lower local air pollution, thereby providing massive health benefits and higher agricultural yields. Recent studies have found that the benefits from lower air pollution alone could more than offset the cost of mitigation in

many regions, especially before 2030 (Shindell et al. 2012; Shindell 2015; Thompson et al. 2014; West et al. 2013). A pathway leading to a reduction in CO2 concentrations from 720 to 525 parts per million (ppm) in 2100 would avoid 0.5 million premature deaths annually in 2030, 1.3 million in 2050, and 2.2 million in 2100, compared to a scenario with only the progress that can be expected from the historically observed uptake of pollution-control technologies (figure 6.7a).
In places where air pollution has reached alarming levels in the past decade, health cobenefits can be particularly large (Matus et al. 2012). In China, air pollution is estimated to result in 7.4 times more premature deaths than in the European Union (EU) (Watts et al. 2015), and the estimated cost of ambient air pollution in terms of morbidity and mortality is around $1.9 trillion annually in China and India alone (OECD 2014a). In East Asia, about 500,000 premature deaths would be avoided annually in 2050 under

Note: Baseline is a reference scenario leading to CO2 concentration around 720 parts per million (ppm) in 2100, which assumes an uptake of pollution control technology consistent with historical experience (Smith, West, and Kyle 2011). RCP4.5 is a scenario with mitigation policies that would lead to 525 ppm in 2100. (More ambitious decarbonization would tend to increase cobenefits). The difference between Baseline and RCP4.5 can be attributed uniquely to GHG emissions reductions.

climate mitigation (figure 6.7b). In India, if health benefits from lower PM2.5 emissions (a decrease of 50 percent by 2050 in tiny particulate matter) were valued similarly to the approach used in the EU for air pollution, they would offset the cost of emission reductions in full (Markandya et al. 2009; Watts et al. 2015). Public transportation is an example of a measure that can reduce local pollutants--in addition to transport costs, congestion, and GHG emissions.
Another area where cobenefits can be generated using mitigation policies is land-based mitigation and policies and payment for ecosystem services. These schemes require developing effective institutions (like land tenure) and enforcement capacity, and they need to be designed explicitly to support poverty reduction. If carbon-related payments were fully developed and pro-poor participation conditions secured, an estimated 25­50 million low-income households could benefit from them by 2030 (Milder, Scherr, and Bracer 2010). And climate-friendly landscape management can be more productive and more resilient to climate shocks (chapter 2).
In most cases, governments need to enact policies to actively promote the adoption of such no-regret options. A recent World Bank

report reviews market and government failures that hamper their adoption--including incorrect pricing, split incentives, poor enforcement of existing regulations, lack of information, behavioral failures, and limits to the financing capacity of stakeholders. It also proposes available solutions to overcome them, like information labels or performance standards (Fay et al. 2015).
Capturing these opportunities should be a priority for all countries at all income levels. The international community can help, by providing a combination of technical assistance and better access to green technologies. For instance, the UNEP/GEF en.lighten initiative supports countries to implement measures to reduce inefficient lighting. The GFEI builds administrative and technical capacity in developing countries, with the final objective of helping them implement the policies that will double the energy efficiency of the global private car fleet.
The international community--and high-income countries--can also help fund innovation to come up with the solutions that developing countries need (like improved building design and materials for tropical climates).
Multilateral or bilateral development banks (MDBs) can provide advisory services to help countries develop strong capital markets and channel official development assistance. This is particularly important for infrastructure: although MDBs' financial resources are small relative to the need-- MDB lending for infrastructure were about $90 billion in 2011, whereas $1 trillion per year would be needed to close the infrastructure gap in developing countries--they often fund a substantial share of infrastructure investments in the poorest countries. MDBs can have a significant impact if they are leveraged to make emissions-reduction investments more attractive to the private sector (for instance, by derisking projects with guarantees and blended financial instruments).
Financial tools for the private sector are also important. The International Finance Corporation recently provided a $30 million loan to the responsAbility Energy Access

Fund, which finances manufacturers and distributors of affordable solar-powered devices. These devices give underserved people access to LED-based lighting and power for charging cell phones or small appliances, thereby supporting economic activity and better livelihoods.
To protect poor and vulnerable people, climate mitigation policies can be combined with complementary policies, including social protection. To stay on a pathway compatible with zero net emissions before 2100, countries will have to do more than implement win-win options, potentially creating costs and trade-offs with poverty reduction. For instance, a key concern is that carbon taxes or fossil fuel subsidy removals can jeopardize the switch from traditional biomass (which would not be impacted by higher energy or carbon prices) to modern cooking fuels, such as electricity or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (which would become more expensive). This matters greatly because traditional cooking fuels are unhealthy and worsen gender imbalances and educational opportunities, given the time women and children must spend to collect them (WHO 2006).

Fortunately, studies suggest that countries can reduce their GHG emissions while ensuring universal access to modern cooking (for example, Pachauri et al. 2013). One approach is to sequence fossil fuel subsidy removal, removing subsidies on LPG later on. Similarly, carbon taxes can be combined with policies that help the shift to modern energy, such as low-cost financing for clean cookstove purchase or temporary subsidies for modern energy. If well targeted, policies that support LPG use would have a negligible impact on GHG emissions (Pachauri et al. 2013). More generally, providing universal access to basic services would have no significant impact on global emissions--even using current technologies (box 6.3).
In Peru, the Fondo de Inclusion Social Energetico mails LPG vouchers to poor households with their electricity bill (targeting households who own an LPG cookstove and consume less than a given threshold of electricity per month). Under India's Direct Benefits Transfer for LPG program, cash transfers are credited directly to the bank accounts of LPG consumers (this is done instead of reducing the market price of LPG

BOX 6.3 Is there a trade-off between climate mitigation and reducing extreme poverty?

Many recent studies support the idea that providing those who are currently extremely poor with access to basic services would not jeopardize climate mitigation.
· Above a human development index (HDI) of 0.8 (the UN threshold to be considered a developed country), carbon emissions and the HDI are decoupled (Steinberger and Roberts 2010).
· The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that universal access to basic energy services by 2030 could be achieved by increasing electricity consumption by 2.5 percent, and fossil fuel consumption by only 0.8 percent (IEA 2011).
· The World Development Report 2010 estimates that the additional emissions needed to provide universal access to electricity in 2010 could be offset by a switch of the U.S. vehicle fleet to European standards (World Bank 2010).

However, these studies rely on a very restrictive definition of access to basic services--one that remains far below what is considered acceptable in developed countries. For instance, for access to electricity, the IEA uses two threshold levels of consumption: 250 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year for rural households and 500 kWh per year for urban households. In rural areas, this is sufficient to use a floor fan, a mobile telephone, and two compact fluorescent light bulbs for about five hours per day. In urban areas, it can include an efficient refrigerator, a second mobile telephone per household, and another appliance (such as a small television or a computer). Even middle-class living conditions imply a much higher level of consumption

(ESMAP and SE4ALL 2015). And, historically, there has been a strong relationship between energy consumption and GDP--even though there are decreasing returns on how much energy consumption helps increase life expectancy and basic needs (Figure B6.3.1).
So eradicating extreme poverty can be done at low energy consumption levels, but generalizing

affluence and modern living standards with current development patterns and technologies would result in much higher energy consumption and GHG emissions (Rao, Riahi, and Grubler 2014). This is why immediate action is needed in all countries to achieve affluence and shared prosperity while decarbonizing the global economy by the end of the century.

cylinders, to reduce fraud). Sometimes the modern cook fuel is electricity, and governments want to phase out LPG (this will likely be increasingly important as governments engage on the path to zero net GHG emissions). Ecuador is considering how to remove LPG subsidies to reduce LPG imports and GHG emissions without hurting poor households. The idea is to facilitate the switch to electric cookstoves before LPG subsidies are removed by providing financing options when buying the stoves and temporarily subsidizing electricity (which comes mainly from local hydropower).
However, fuel subsidies introduce risks of subsidy diversion, smuggling, and fraud (Barnwal 2014; Cunha, Trezzi, and CalvoGonzalez 2015). In Ghana, illegal diversion of a heavily subsidized fuel for fishing, ""premix,"" has been problematic for decades. For many years, the price of gasoline has been double--and between 2011 and 2013 even triple or quadruple--the price of premix fuel, creating enormous scope for commercial malpractice and illegal gains (Kojima 2013). This is why more countries are now turning toward cash transfers to compensate poor people and protect them against higher energy prices.
Indeed, the best strategy may be to implement carbon prices or remove fossil fuel subsidies, while recycling revenues through cash transfers or programs that help the poor (OECD 2014b; Vagliasindi 2012). When carbon revenues or savings from fossil fuel subsidy removal are recycled in lump-sum cash transfers to the population, the overall impact is to improve equity (Bento et al. 2009; Callan et al. 2009; Cohen, Fullerton, and Topel 2013). That result directly follows from the fact that poor households consume less energy, in absolute amounts, than nonpoor households. Data from developing countries suggest that taking $100 away from fossil fuel subsidies and redistributing the money equally throughout the population would on average transfer $13 to the bottom quintile and take $23 away from the top quintile (Arze del Granado, Coady, and Gillinghan 2012) (figure 6.8). In other words, a carbon

tax (or fossil fuel subsidy removal) coupled with targeted or untargeted cash transfers, achieves two different objectives: reducing GHGs and improving income distribution (Klenert et al. 2015).
All the revenues from carbon prices or fossil fuel subsidy reform cannot always be used for direct redistribution to households, but that does not necessarily threaten the positive distributive impact. In British Columbia, revenues from the carbon tax are used to cut taxes on both labor and capital, and the scheme is still progressive overall (Beck et al. 2015).
Poverty benefits can be further increased if revenues are used for more targeted instruments that help poor people (like targeted cash transfers), or for better social safety nets (like school feeding). Based on current CO2 emissions and without any international transfer, a $30/tCO2 (ton of carbon dioxide) domestic carbon tax would raise resources amounting to more than 1.5 percent of local GDP in half of the 87 countries (both developed and developing) where data are available (figure 6.9, panel a). Remember from chapter 5 that, in Sahel countries, 1.5 percent of GDP is more than the amount needed to protect households affected by severe droughts. And in 60 out of the 87 countries, a $30/tCO2 domestic tax would provide the resources to more than double current levels

of social assistance in the country (figure 6.9, panel b). Even a low carbon tax at $10/tCO2 would make it possible to significantly scale up social assistance, or other investments that benefit poor people, such as connection to sanitation and improved drinking water or access to modern energy. Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, and Mexico provide examples where well-functioning cash-transfer programs have been used to protect basic consumption by the poor from price increases resulting from subsidy removals (Beaton and Lonton 2010; Di Bella et al. 2015; Vagliasindi 2012).
Other emissions-reduction policies can also have significant distributional impacts that need to be explored before policies are implemented (Fay et al. 2015). For instance, it has been shown that feed-in tariffs for renewable energy in the United Kingdom and Germany are slightly regressive (Grösche and Schröder 2014; Grover 2013). Wealthy households benefit from the scheme, because

they tend to own more houses or land where photovoltaic panels can be installed, and can better afford the high upfront cost of installing panels. In contrast, everyone pays higher electricity tariffs to finance the scheme. This problem applies to other subsidies to encourage low-carbon investment--such as hybrid or electric vehicles, residential heating, or air-conditioning--that are more likely to be undertaken by wealthy households (Borenstein and Davis 2015). But solutions have been proposed, such as financing subsidies with progressive income taxes or specifically encouraging poor households to participate (CPUC 2013; Granqvist and Grover 2015; Macintosh and Wilkinson 2010).
More generally, the distributional impacts of climate mitigation policies can in principle be corrected using independent policies specifically designed to redistribute income in the economy, such as using income or consumption taxes to fund cash transfers or social

safety net programs (Borenstein and Davis 2015; Gahvari and Mattos 2007; Lindert, Skoufias, and Shapiro 2006). A study based on World Bank household surveys reveals that most countries where the GDP per capita is above $4,000 (in purchasing power parity) can reliably redistribute poverty away using their own internal resources (Ravallion 2010), and thus can protect poor people against the potential negative effects of climate mitigation policies. This is important because around 70 percent of people in extreme poverty live in countries with a GDP per capita above $4,000, where they could be protected by redistribution from possible negative effects of climate mitigation.
The international community has a critical role to play in helping reconcile immediate poverty-reduction objectives and climate stabilization. In very poor countries, however, it may be difficult for economic, political, or institutional reasons to protect poor people against possible negative side effects of climate policies. In particular, countries with a GDP per capita below $4,000 per capita (in purchasing power parity) cannot always rely on internal redistribution (Ravallion 2010). In the poorest countries, even the ""middle class"" is poor, and there are simply not enough resources for redistribution: even taxing 100 percent of the income of the ""rich"" would not suffice to lift the poorest out of poverty. In these very poor countries, even if most of the cost of climate mitigation is paid by the upper quintiles of the population, climate mitigation could still aggravate poverty, because the top quintiles are still in or close to poverty.
In countries where poor people cannot easily be protected by domestic resources and policies, support from the international community is needed to offset potential trade-offs between poverty reduction and climate change mitigation. This is especially the case for investments that involve high immediate costs--and therefore large trade-offs with other investments--but are urgently needed to prevent irreversibility and lock-ins into carbon-intensive patterns (like those

regarding urban transport, energy infrastructure, or deforestation).
The typical example is urban transit. While transit-oriented development may require higher upfront costs and investments than road-based low-density urbanization, the high urbanization rate in many developing countries and the lifetime of urban forms and transit infrastructure means that there is a window of opportunity now to build efficient transit-oriented cities. After a city is developed, it is practically impossible to modify its urban form. This makes it essential to provide developing countries with the resources and financial instruments that make it possible for them to drive urban development toward the efficient patterns that are needed to decarbonize the economy before the end of the century.
One source of international funding is private climate finance, for instance through interconnected carbon markets (World Bank 2014b). But these flows are likely to focus on the cheapest emissions-reduction options available in developing countries (Narain and Veld 2008; Rose, Bulte, and Folmer 1999). Indeed, carbon markets are designed to help economic actors capture the lowest cost options to meet a short-term emissions- reduction target, not necessarily to trigger investment in long-lived low-carbon equipment that avoid lock-ins into carbon intensive patterns (Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2014). For example, these flows alone are unlikely to finance the upfront cost of more efficient cities and land use planning, or any other measure that generates benefits only over the very long term.
Thus, additional resources are needed that focus on these long-term challenges. In particular, they can substantially increase the efficiency of the global decarbonization by financing urgent measures that avoid carbonintensive lock-ins in low-income countries (like public transportation infrastructure)-- even if these measures are more expensive (per abated ton of carbon) than alternative short-term emissions reductions (Vogt-Schilb, Hallegatte, and de Gouvello 2014).

In conclusion
This report provides new quantification of how climate change will affect poor people and poverty through agricultural impacts (chapter 2), natural disasters (chapter 3), and health shocks (chapter 4). In each of these chapters, it also identifies opportunities for better policies or specific interventions that can reduce these impacts, sometimes even below their current levels in spite of climate change. Chapter 5 builds on these sectoral solutions by exploring cross-cutting options to enhance resilience (like financial inclusion and social safety nets). It also identifies options to adapt to a context of changing climate with more frequent and intense shocks and changing environmental conditions, like permanently reduced rainfall. And it stresses the need for a governance system that gives a voice to poor people.
This report suggests that developing countries have a window of opportunity to build resilience and reduce short-term climate change impacts on poverty through development policies that are inclusive and climate informed. For governments, two implications emerge:
· Greater urgency in reducing poverty and providing poor people with opportunities, basic services, and well-designed social safety nets to reduce their vulnerability before climate change impacts become much larger.
· The critical importance of ensuring that investments and development patterns are not creating future vulnerabilities as environmental and climate conditions change.
In parallel, the international community can do much to ensure that development is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed. It can offer resources for climate risk analysis and project preparation; and it can ensure that financing instruments and support are available to cover higher upfront costs.
However, in the absence of mitigation policies, risks for development and poverty eradication will only grow over time. This means

that countries need to act now to reduce their emissions, using two approaches:
· Focus on emissions-reduction options that create synergies with development or yield health or economic cobenefits--like using renewable power and minigrids in remote rural areas, or switching to energy- efficient light bulbs and appliances.
· Protect poor people--for instance by strengthening social protection and cash transfers, possibly financed with energy taxes or fossil fuel subsidy removal.
But the second approach will be particularly challenging for low-income countries, because they sometimes lack the capacity or simply the resources to implement substantial redistribution policies. The international community should support costly emissions reduction in these countries, especially investing in long-lived low-carbon infrastructure (like urban public transit in cities), because waiting will only make low-carbon development more expensive over the long term.
Bringing together the short- and long-run view, this report overall emphasizes the negative impact of climate change on poverty eradication, and the risk that unabated climate change creates for the objective of eradicating extreme poverty. In parallel, it also identifies many policy options that can be implemented and would make it possible to achieve our poverty objectives in spite of climate change. Doing so implies a combination of (i) rapid, inclusive, and climate-informed development and targeted adaptation interventions to cope with the short-term impacts of climate change; and (ii) pro-poor mitigation policies to limit long-term impacts and create an environment that allows for global prosperity and the sustainable eradication of poverty.

Climate change threatens the objective of eradicating poverty. Poor people and poor countries are already vulnerable to all types of climate-related shocks--natural disasters that destroy assets and livelihoods; waterborne diseases and pests that become more prevalent during heat waves, floods, or droughts; crop failure from reduced rainfall; and spikes in food prices that follow extreme weather events. Such shocks can erase decades of hard work and leave people with irreversible human and physical losses. Changes in climate
conditions caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will worsen these shocks and slow down poverty reduction.
The good news is that, at least until 2030, ""good development"" can prevent most of these impacts. By ""good development,"" we mean development that is rapid, inclusive, and climate informed; includes strong social safety nets and universal health coverage; and is complemented with targeted adaptation interventions such as heat-tolerant crops and early warning systems. Absent such good development, many people will still be living in or close to extreme poverty in 2030, with few resources to cope with climate shocks and adapt to long-
term trends, and climate change could increase extreme poverty by more than 100 million people by 2030.
In the longer run, beyond 2030, our ability to adapt to unabated climate change is limited. To keep the longer-term impacts on poverty in check, immediate emissions-reduction policies are needed that bring emissions to zero by the end of the 21st century. These policies need not threaten short-term progress on poverty reduction--provided they are well designed and international support is available for poor countries.
Ending poverty and stabilizing climate change will be unprecedented global achievements. But neither can be attained without the other: they need to be designed and implemented as an integrated strategy. Shock Waves: Managing the Impacts of Climate Change on Poverty brings together those two objectives and explores how they can more easily be achieved if considered together. The book provides guidance on how to design climate policies so they contribute to poverty reduction, and on how to design poverty reduction policies so they
contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience building.

Turn Down
The Heat Confronting the New Climate Normal











Foreword

Dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world, damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk.
   Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are occurring more frequently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions like the Mediterranean are getting dryer. A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity is affecting the Caribbean and Central America.
   There is growing evidence that warming close to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels is locked-in to the Earth’s atmospheric system due to past and predicted emissions of greenhouse gases, and climate change impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.
   As the planet warms, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes which occur once in hundreds of years, if ever, and considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the “new climate normal” as we approach 4°C—a frightening world of increased risks and global instability.
   The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change, diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. Ending poverty, increasing global prosperity and reducing global inequality, already difficult, will be much harder with 2°C warming, but at 4°C there is serious doubt whether these goals can be achieved at all.
   For this report, the third in the Turn Down the Heat series, we turned again to the scientists at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics. We asked them to look at the likely impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming on agricultural production, water resources, cities and ecosystems across Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia.
   Their findings are alarming.
   In Latin America and the Caribbean, heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. In Brazil, at 2°C warming, crop yields could decrease by up to 70 percent for soybean and up to 50 percent for wheat. Ocean acidification, sea level rise, tropical cyclones and temperature changes will negatively impact coastal livelihoods, tourism, health and food and water security, particularly in the Caribbean. Melting glaciers would be a hazard for Andean cities.
   In the Middle East and North Africa, a large increase in heat-waves combined with warmer average temperatures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources with major consequences for regional food security. Crop yields could decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5-2°C and by almost 60 percent at 3-4°C. At the same time, migration and climate-related pressure on resources might increase the risk of conflict.
   In the Western Balkans and Central Asia, reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat as temperatures rise toward 4°C. Melting glaciers in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows

 TURN DOWN THE HEAT: CONFRONTING THE NEW CLIMATE NORMAL
will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods. In the Balkans, a higher risk of drought results in potential declines for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In Macedonia, yield losses are projected of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C warming. In northern Russia, forest dieback and thawing of permafrost threaten to amplify global warming as stored carbon and methane are released into the atmosphere, giving rise to a self-amplifying feedback loop.
   Tarn Down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal builds on our 2012 report, which concluded the world would warm by 4° C by the end of this century with devastating consequences if we did not take concerted action now. It complements our 2015 report that looked at the potential risks to development under different warming scenarios in Sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South Asia, and which warned that we could experience a 2°C world in our lifetime.
   Many of the worst projected climate impacts outlined in this latest report could still be avoided by holding warming below 2°C. But, this will require substantial technological, economic, institutional and behavioral change. It will require leadership at every level of society.
   Today the scientific evidence is overwhelming, and it's clear that we cannot continue down the current path of unchecked, growing emissions. The good news is that there is a growing consensus on what it will take to make changes to the unsustainable path we are currently on.
   More and more voices are arguingthat is possible to grow greener without necessarily growing slower. Today, we know that action is urgently needed on climate change, but it does not have to come at the expense of economic growth. We need smart policy choices that stimulate a shift to clean public transport and energy efficiency in factories, buildings and appliances can achieve both growth and climate benefits.
   This last report in the Tarn Down the Heat series comes at a critical moment. Earlier this year, the UN Secretary General's Climate Summit un leased a new wave of optimism. But our reports make clear that time is of the essence.
   Governments will gather first in Lima and then Paris for critical negotiations on a new climate treaty. Inside and outside of the conference halls, global leaders will need to take difficult decisions that will require, in some instances, short term sacrifice but ultimately lead to long term gains for all.
   At the World Bank Group we will use our financial capacity to help tackle climate change. We will innovate and bring forward new financial instruments. We will use our knowledge and our convening power. We will use our evidence and data to advocate and persuade. In short, we will do everything we can to help countries and communities build resilience and adapt to the climate impacts already being felt today and ensure that finance flows to where it is most needed.
    Our response to the challenge of climate change will define the legacy of our generation. The stakes have never been higher.

President, World Bank Group





Executive
Summary
Executive Summary

 The data show that dramatic climate changes, heat and weather extremes are already impacting people, damaging crops and coastlines and putting food, water, and energy security at risk. Across the three regions studied in this report, record-breaking temperatures are occurring more frequently, rainfall has increased in intensity in some places, while drought-prone regions are getting dryer. In an overview of social vulnerability, the poor and underprivileged, as well as the elderly and children, are found to be often hit the hardest. There is growing evidence, that even with very ambitious mitigation action, warming close to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by mid-century is already locked-in to the Earth's atmospheric system and climate change impacts such as extreme heat events may now be unavoidable.1 If the planet continues warming to 4°C, climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the new climate normal—a world of increased risks and instability. The consequences for development would be severe as crop yields decline, water resources change, diseases move into new ranges, and sea levels rise. The task of promoting human development, of ending poverty, increasing global prosperity, and reducing global inequality will be very challenging in a 2°C world, but in a 4°C world there is serious doubt whether this can be achieved at all. Immediate steps are needed to help countries adapt to the climate impacts being felt today and the unavoidable consequences of a rapidly warming world. The benefits of strong, early action on climate change, action that follows clean, low carbon pathways and avoids locking in unsustainable growth strategies, far outweigh the costs. Many of the worst projected climate impacts could still be avoided by holding warming to below 2°C. But, the time to act is now.
 This report focuses on the risks of climate change to development in Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, and parts of Europe and Central Asia. Building on earlier Turn Down the Heat reports this new scientific analysis examines the likely impacts of present day (0.8°C), 2°C and 4°C warming above pre-industrial temperatures on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services and coastal vulnerability for affected populations.


Scope of the Report
This third report in the Turn Down the Heat series1 2 3 4 covers three World Bank regions: Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC); the Middle East and North Africa (MENA); and parts of Europe and Central Asia (ECA).5 The focus is on the risks of climate change to development. While covering a range of sectors, special attention is paid to projected impacts on food and energy systems, water resources, and ecosystem services. The report also considers the social vulnerability that could magnify or moderate the climate change repercussions for human well-being. The report complements the first Turn Down the Heat report (2012) that offered a global overview of climate change and its impacts in a 4°C world6 and concluded that impacts are expected to be felt disproportionately in developing countries around the equatorial regions. Also, it extends the analysis in the second report (2013) that focused on the consequences of climate change for present day, 2°C, and 4°C warming above pre-industrial levels in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South East Asia and demonstrated the potential of early onset of impacts at lower levels of warming.
    This analysis draws on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) Working Group reports released in 2013 and 2014, as well as peer-reviewed literature published after the cutoff dates for AR5. The few cases where there are significant differences in interpretation of projected impacts from the IPCC assessments (such as for sea-level rise and El Niño) are highlighted and explained.
The Global Picture
This report reaffirms earlier assessments, including the IPCC AR5 and previous Turn Down the Heat reports, that in the absence of near-term mitigation actions and further commitments to reduce emissions the likelihood of 4°C warming being reached or exceeded this century has increased. Under current policies there is about a 40 percent chance of exceeding 4°C by 2100 and a 10 percent chance of exceeding 5°C.7 However, many of the worst projected climate impacts in this report could still be avoided by holding warming below 2°C.
Selected Key Findings from Across the Regions
At the current level of 0.8°C warming above pre-industrial levels, adverse impacts of climate change have already been observed. Examples include:
• Extreme heat events are occurring more frequently. The occurrence of record-breaking monthly mean temperatures has been attributed to climate change with 80 percent probability.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY



• Extreme precipitation has increased in frequency and intensity in many places.
• A robust drying trend has been observed for already drought- prone regions such as the Mediterranean.
• A significant increase in tropical North Atlantic cyclone activity has been observed and is affecting the Caribbean and Central America.
     Under future climate change scenarios projected impacts include:
1. Highly unusual and unprecedented heat extremes: State- of-the-art climate modeling shows that extreme heat events increase not only in frequency but also impact a larger area of land under unabated warming. The prevalence of highly unusual and unprecedented heat extremes increases rapidly under an emissions pathway associated with a 4°C world.8 9 Highly unusual heat extremes are similar to those experienced in Russia and Central Asia in 2010 and the United States in 2012 and unprecedented heat extremes refer to events essentially absent under present day climate conditions. Unprecedented heat extremes would likely remain largely absent in a 2°C world but in a 4°C world, could affect 70-80 percent of the land area in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and approximately 55 percent of the land area in the parts of Europe and Central Asia assessed in this report.
2. Rainfall regime changes and water availability: Precipitation changes are projected under continued warming with substantial, adverse consequences for water availability. Central America, the Caribbean, the Western Balkans, and the Middle East and North Africa stand out as hotspots where precipitation is projected to decline 20-50 percent in a 4°C world. Conversely, heavy precipitation events are projected to intensify in Central and Eastern Siberia and northwestern South America with precipitation intensity increasing by around 30 percent and flooding risks increasing substantially in a 4°C world.
• In the Western Balkans and Central Asia, water availability becomes a threat as temperatures rise toward 4°C. With earlier glacier melt in Central Asia shifting the timing of water flows, and a higher risk of drought in the Balkans, this carries consequences for crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In Macedonia, for example, there could be yield losses of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C warming. Flood risk is expected to increase slightly along the Danube, Sava and Tisza rivers.
3. Agricultural yields and food security: Significant crop yield impacts are already being felt at 0.8°C warming, and as temperatures rise from 2°C to 4°C, climate change will add further pressure on agricultural systems.
• The risks of reduced crop yields and production losses increase rapidly above 1.5°-2°C warming. In the Middle East and North Africa and the Latin America and the Caribbean regions, without further adaptation actions, strong reductions in potential yield are projected for around 2°C warming. For example, a 30-70 percent decline in yield for soybeans and up to 50 percent decline for wheat in Brazil, a 50 percent decrease for wheat in Central America and the Caribbean, and 10-50 percent reduction for wheat in Tunisia. Projected changes in potential crop yields in Central Asia are uncertain at around 2°C warming. Increasing droughts and flooding events represent a major risk for agriculture in the Western Balkans.
• While adaptation interventions and C02 fertilization may compensate for some of the adverse effects of climate change below 2°C warming, this report reaffirms the findings of the IPCC AR5 that under 3-4°C warming large negative impacts on agricultural productivity can be expected. There is some empirical evidence that, despite possible positive C02 fertilization effects leading to increased productivity, higher atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide could result in lowered protein and micronutrient (iron and zinc) levels of some major grain crops (e.g., wheat and rice).
• The projected impacts on subsistence and export crops production systems (e.g., soybeans, maize, wheat, and rice) would be felt at the local, national, and global levels. While global trade can improve food security and protect against local shocks, there is a possibility for some regions to become over dependent on food imports and thus more vulnerable to weather events in other world regions and to the interruption of imports because of export bans in those regions.
4. Terrestrial Ecosystems: Ecosystem shifts are projected with increasing temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns significantly diminishing ecosystem services. This would have major repercussions on, for example, the global carbon cycle. For example:
• Projected increases in heat and drought stress, together with continuing deforestation, substantially increase the risk of large-scale forest degradation (reduction in forest biomass and area) in the Amazon rainforest. This could turn this carbon sink of global importance into a source of carbon; this has already been observed as a consequence of the severe droughts in 2005 and 2010 when scientists estimated that the Amazon faced a decrease in carbon storage of approximately 1.6 Pg carbon (2005) and 2.2 Pg carbon (2010) compared to non-drought years.7
• Russia’s permafrost regions and boreal forests are sensitive to changes in temperature that could lead to productivity increases. But there is a risk of increasing disturbances, such as fires and pests, leading to widespread tree mortality. Forest dieback and thawing of permafrost threaten to amplify global warming as stored carbon and methane are released into the atmosphere, giving rise to a self- amplifying feedback loop. With a 2°C warming, methane emissions from permafrost thawing could increase by 20-30 percent across boreal Russia.
5. Marine ecosystems: Substantial, adverse effects on marine ecosystems and their productivity are expected with rising temperatures, increases in ocean acidity, and likely reductions in available oxygen due to their combined effects. Observed rates of ocean acidification are already the highest in 300 million years and rates of sea level rise are the highest for 6,000 years.
    Projections of coral bleaching indicate that preserving more than 10 percent of these unique ecosystems calls for limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Reef-building corals are critical for beach formation, coastal protection, fisheries, and tourism.
    Physiological changes to fish and fish larvae have been observed and are expected with future ocean acidification. Below 2°C warming and without taking into account changes in ocean acidity, fishery catches in a number of locations are projected to markedly decrease by 2050 as fish populations migrate towards cooler waters.
6. Sea-level rise: In a 1.5°C world sea level rise is projected to increase by 0.36 m (range of 0.20 m to 0.60 m) and by 0.58 m (range of 0.40 m to 1.01 m) in a 4°C world for the period
 7 The change in carbon sequestration is caused by the combined effects of reduced uptake of carbon resulting from suppressed tree growth due to the drought, and loss of carbon due to drought induced tree mortality and decomposition over several years.

2081-2100 compared to the reference period 1986-2005.10 Due to the time lag in the oceans’ response and the long response time of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to atmospheric temperatures (thermal inertia) sea levels will continue to rise for many centuries beyond 2100.
• Sea-level rise poses a particular threat to urban communities in the Middle East and North Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, where large urban settlements and important infrastructure are situated along coastlines. The impact of rising sea levels will be particularly severe for the Caribbean island communities as possibilities for retreat are extremely limited. Rising sea levels will substantially increase the risk posed by storm surges and tropical cyclones, in particular for highly exposed small island states and low-lying coastal zones. In addition, rising sea levels could contribute to increased salt-water intrusion in freshwater aquifers (particularly in the Middle East and North Africa), a process made worse by other climate impacts (e.g., reduction in water availability) and other human-induced drivers (e.g., resource overuse).
7. Glaciers: A substantial loss of glacier volume and extent has been observed under current levels of warming in the Andes and Central Asia. Increasing glacial melt poses a high risk of flooding and severely reduces freshwater resources during crop growing seasons. It can also have negative impacts on hydropower supply.
• Tropical glaciers in the Central Andes have lost large amounts of ice volume throughout the 20th century and complete déglaciation is projected in a 4°C world. In Peru it is estimated that a 50 percent reduction in glacier runoff would result in a decrease in annual power output of approximately 10 percent, from 1540 gigawatt hours (GWh) to 1250 GWh.
• Since the 1960s Central Asian glaciers have reduced in area by 3-14 percent depending on their location. Further substantial losses of around 50 percent and up to 80 percent are projected for a 2°C and a 4°C world respectively. As a result, river flows are expected to shrink by 25 percent at around 3° C warming during the summer months when water demand for agriculture is highest.
♦ In Central Asia hydropower generation has the potential to play a major role in the future energy mix however the predicted changes in runoff distribution will mean that there will be less water available for energy generation in summer months when it will compete with demands from agriculture.

Social Vulnerability to Climate Change. The social impacts of climate change are hard to predict with certainty as they depend on climatic factors and their interaction with wider development trends. However, there is clear evidence that climate change is already affecting livelihoods and wellbeing in parts of the three regions and is likely to do so to a significantly greater extent if more extensive climate change occurs (Box 2). Where governance is weak, or infrastructure outdated or insufficient (as in parts of all three regions), this is likely to amplify the social challenges associated with adapting to further climate change.
Latin America and the Caribbean
The Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region is highly heterogeneous in terms of economic development and social and indigenous history with a population of 588 million (2013), of which almost 80 percent is urban. The current GDP is estimated at $5,655 trillion (2013) with a per capita GNI of $9,314 in 2013. In 2012, approximately 25 percent of the population was living in poverty and 12 percent in extreme poverty, representing a clear decrease compared to earlier years. Undernourishment in the region, for example, declined from 14.6 percent in 1990 to
8.3 percent in 2012. Despite considerable economic and social development progress in past decades, income inequality in the region remains high.
    At the current 0.8°C warming significant impacts of climate change are being felt throughout the LAC region’s terrestrial (e.g. Andean mountains and rainforests) and marine (especially the coral reefs) biomes. As global mean temperatures rise to 2°C and beyond the projected intensity and severity of impacts will increase across the entire region (three significant impacts are described below).
    Figure 2 shows the occurrence of highly unusual summer temperatures in a 2°C and 4°C world. Box 3 gives an overview of the climate risks in the region.

Changes to the hydrological cycle could endanger the stability of freshwater supplies and ecosystem services.
Altered precipitation cycles characterized by more intense downpours followed by longer droughts, loss of glaciers, degradation of key ecosystems, and the loss of critical ecosystem services (e.g., water supplies, water buffering, retention, regulation, and soil protection) will impact freshwater supplies regionally and potentially generate upstream-downstream tradeoffs and synergies. A range of impacts are expected to increase in intensity and severity as global mean temperatures rise from 2°C to 4°C.
• Projections indicate that most dry regions get drier and wet regions get wetter. Reductions in precipitation are as high as 20-40 percent for the Caribbean, Central America, central Brazil, and Patagonia in a 4°C world. Drought conditions are projected to increase by more than 20 percent. Limiting warming to 2°C is projected to reduce the risk of drought significantly: to a one percent increase of days with drought conditions in the Caribbean and a nine percent increase for South America. At the same time, an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events is projected particularly for the tropical and subtropical Pacific coastline and southern Brazil.
• Massive loss of glaciers is projected in the Andes in a 2°C world (up to 90 percent) and almost complete glacier loss beyond 4°C. Changes to glacial melt, in response to land surface warming, alter the timing and magnitude of river flows and result in a higher risk of flooding and freshwater shortages and damage to infrastructure assets.





♦ Increased droughts and higher mean temperatures are projected to decrease water supplies and affect most ecosystems and agroecosystems. The increasing risk of drought will raise the risk of forest fires, large-scale climate-induced forest degradation and the loss of associated ecosystem services.
♦ Glaciers will melt at an even faster rate than observed, with a peak in river runoff expected in 20-50 years, and possibly earlier in some watersheds. Glacial lake outbursts and connected flooding present a hazard for Andean cities. The loss of glaciers will likely impact the páramos (Andean, high carbon stock moorlands) which are the source of water for many Andean cities. Moreover, degraded highland ecosystems have less capacity to retain water and intensified downpours will increase erosion with a subsequent increase in siltation and damage to hydropower dams, irrigation works, and hydraulic and river defense infrastructure.
♦ The projected trend of more intense rainfall can significantly increase the risk of landslides especially in sloping terrain often occupied by the poorer rural and urban communities.
The major landslides in 2011 in the State of Rio de Janeiro following intense rainfall are a harbinger of the likely severity of projected impacts from more intense rainfall events. Intense

rainfall events can quickly overwhelm natural drainage channels in the landscape as well as urban drainage systems that are unlikely to have been designed for the projected more intense nature rainfall events and flows.
Climate change will place at risk small-ecale subsistence agriculture and large-scale agricultural production for export
 Agriculture in the Latin America and the Caribbean region is heavily dependent on rain-fed systems for both subsistence and export crops; it is therefore vulnerable to climatic variations such as droughts, changing precipitation patterns, and rising temperatures.
♦ Increasing risks for agriculture as warming rises beyond 2°C. There is a clear negative signal for a large variety of crops with 2°C warming, including soybeans (up to a 70 percent yield decline in some areas of Brazil) and maize (up to a 60 percent yield decline in Brazil and Ecuador) by 2050 relative to a 1989-2009 baseline. Simulated adaptation interventions (e.g. improved crop varieties, improved soil and crop management, and supplementary irrigation) alleviated but did not overcome the projected yield declines from climate change. Other studies suggest that in a 3 °C world, the projected negative impacts on individual crops become stronger. For example up to almost 70 percent decline in wheat in Central America and the Caribbean. This implies that climate change threatens not only smallholder farmers, and rural and indigenous communities but also large-scale commodity (soybeans, maize) producers, ranchers, and agribusinesses—with potential negative repercussions on food security and prices in the region and beyond.
• Local food security is seriously threatened by the projected decrease in fishery catch potential. The Caribbean coasts, the Amazon estuaries, and the Rio de la Plata are expected to be particularly affected by declines in catch potential of more than 50 percent as fish stocks migrate in response to warming waters. The Caribbean waters could see declines in the range of 5-50 percent. These estimates are for warming of 2°C by 2050, by which time many of the coral reefs—an important fish nursery and habitat—would be subject to annual bleaching events, further undermining the marine resource base. Ocean acidification could affect fish populations directly, including through physiological damages at early life stages. The effects on the food chain, however, are not yet clear.
• The Southern Cone (Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and southern Brazil) as a major grain and livestock producing region is susceptible to climate shocks, mainly related to changing rainfall patterns and rising heat extremes. This is expected to severely impact maize and soy yields, important export commodities. For example, maize productivity is projected to decline by 15-30 percent in comparison to 1971-2000 levels under warming of 2°C by 2050, and by 30-45 percent under 3°C warming. Strong and/or extreme El Niño events resulting in floods or droughts in the cropping season pose further substantial risks to agriculture in the region.
A stronger prevalence of extreme events is projected that would affect both rural and urban communities, particularly on sloping lands and in coastal regions.
 The region is heavily exposed to the effects of more frequent and intense extreme events, such as those that occur during strong El Niño events and tropical cyclones.
• An increase of approximately 40 percent in the frequency of the strongest north Atlantic tropical cyclones is projected for a 2°C world, and of 80 percent for a 4°C world, compared to present. In LAC, close to 8.5 million people live in the path of hurricanes, and roughly 29 million live in low-elevation coastal zones. The Caribbean is particularly vulnerable as more than 50 percent of its population lives along the coast, and around 70 percent live in coastal cities. More intense tropical cyclones would interact adversely with rising sea levels, exacerbating coastal flooding and storm surge risks, putting entire economies and livelihoods at risk (particularly for island states).
• 
Risks associated with El Niño events and tropical cyclones would occur contemporaneously with a sea-level rise of 38-114 cm thus greatly increasing the risks storm surges.
Sea-level rise is projected to be higher at the Atlantic coast than at the Pacific coast. Sea-level rise off Valparaiso, for example, is projected at 0.35 m for a 2°C world and 0.55 m for a 4°C world (medium estimate). Recife sees projections of approximately
0. 39 m and 0.63 m respectively, with the upper estimates as high as 1.14mina4°C world—the highest in the region.
• Extreme events will strongly affect the rural and urban poor who often reside in informal settlements in high-risk areas (e.g., flood plains and steep slopes). In 2005, the percentage of people living in informal settlements in Latin America was highest in Bolivia (50 percent) and in the Caribbean highest in Haiti (70 percent). The negative effects of extreme events also affect rural communities as they strongly depend on their environment and its natural resource base.
♦ In the Caribbean, substantial adverse impacts on local critical ecosystems, agriculture, infrastructure, and the tourism industry can be expected in a 2°C world. This is due to loss and/or degradation of important assets from the combined effects of increasing sea levels and associated impacts of saline intrusion and storm surges, ocean acidification, bleaching of coral reefs, and loss of the physical protection afforded to coastlines from dead and degrading reefs. Impacts from these and other climatic changes can be expected to grow substantially with increasing warming, especially given the increasing likelihood of more frequent intense tropical cyclones.
The Middle East and North Africa
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is one of the most diverse regions in the world in economic terms, with per-cap it a annual GDP ranging from $1,000 in Yemen to more than $20,000 in the Arab Gulf States. Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, the Arab Republic of Egypt, and Yemen rank 4, 12, 27, ISO, 1S2, and 151 in GDP per capita on a list of 189 countries. In consequence, adaptive capacity and vulnerability to climate risks varies enormously within the region.
    The region's population is projected to double by 2050, which together with projected climate impacts, puts the region under enormous pressure for water and other resources. The region is already highly dependent on food imports. Approximately 50 percent of regional wheat and barley consumption, 40 percent of rice consumption, and nearly 70 percent of maize consumption is met through imports. The region has coped with its water scarcity through a variety of means: abstraction of groundwater, desalinization, and local community coping strategies. Despite its extreme water scarcity, the Gulf countries use more water per capita than the global average, with Arab residential water and energy markets among the most heavily subsidized in the world. The region is very diverse in terms of socio-economic and political conditions. Thus, adaptive capacity and vulnerability to climate risks varies enormously within the region, especially between the Arab Gulf States and the other Middle East and North Africa countries.
    The Middle East and North Africa region emerges as one of the hotspots for worsening extreme heat, drought, and aridity conditions. Agriculture, where 70 percent is rain-fed, is highly exposed to changing climatic conditions. Warming of 0.2°C per decade has been observed in the region from the 1961-1990, and since then the region is warming at an even faster rate. Projections indicate that more than 90 percent of summers will have highly unusual heat extremes in a4°C world compared to between 20^-0 percent of summers in a 2°C world (Figure 5).
    Given its high import dependency, the region is vulnerable to effects beyond its borders. While societal responses to such changes remain hard to predict, it is clear that extreme impacts, such as a more than 45 percent decrease in annual water discharge projected for a 4°C world in parts of the region, would present unprecedented challenges to the social systems affected. Climate change might act as a threat multiplier to the security situation in the region by imposing additional pressures on already scarce resources and by reinforcing pre-existing threats connected to migration following forced displacement. Box 5 gives an overview of the key climate risks in the region.
 Changing precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme heat pose high risks to agricultural production and regional food security.
 Most agriculture in the region takes place in the semi-arid climate zone, either close to the coast or in the highlands, and is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
♦ Rainfall is predicted to decline by 20-40 percent in a 2°C world and by up to 60 percent in a 4° C world in parts of the region. Agricultural productivity is expected to drop in parts of the Middle East and North Africa region with increasing water scarcity and higher temperatures which are expected to deviate more and more from the temperature optima of several crops (and possibly even exceed their heat tolerance levels).

Box 5: Selected Climate Risks in the Middle East and North Africa Region
 The region will be severely affected at 2°C and 4°C warming, particularly because of the large increase in projected heat extremes, the substantial reduction in water availability, and expected consequences for regional food security. High exposure to sea-level rise in the coming decades is linked to large populations and assets in coastal areas. In a 2°C world already low annual river discharge levels are projected to drop by more than 15 percent and highly unusual heat extremes are projected to affect about a third of the land. Crop yield declines coupled with impacts in other grain-producing regions could contribute to increasing food prices in the region. The growing food import dependency further exacerbates such risks. Deteriorating rural livelihoods may contribute to internal and international migration, adding further stress on particularly urban infrastructure, with associated risks for poor migrants. Migration and climate related pressure on resources (e.g. water} might increase the risk of conflict.



Maghreb
Strong warming reduction in annual precipitation, increased water stress and reduced agricultural productivity. Large coastal cities exposed to sea level rise.
Climate change risks will have severe implications on farmers' livelihoods, country economy; and food security Exposure of criticai coastal assets would have impact on the economy including tourism. There is risk for accelerated migration flows to urban areas and social conflict

Mashrek and Eastern Parts
Highly unusual heat and decrease in annual precipitation will increase aridity, decrease in snow water storage and river runoff for example in Jordon, Euphrates and Tigris. Adverse consequences for mostly rain-fed agricultural and food production.
Climate change risks will have severe implications on farmers' livelihoods, country economy and food security There is a risk for accelerated migration flows to urban areas and social conflict
 
Arabian Peninsula
 Highly unusual heat extremes in central Arabian Peninsula. In southern parts relative increase in annual precipitation, but uncertain trend of annual precipitation in central part. Sea level rise in the Arabian Sea likely higher than in Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts with risk of storm surges and adverse consequences for infrastructure.
 More heat extremes expected to increase thermal discomfort, posing risk to labor productivity and health.




• Crop yields in the region may decrease by up to 30 percent at 1.5-2°C warming in Jordan, Egypt, and Libya and by almost 60 percent (for wheat) at 3-4° C warming in the Syrian Arab Republic. The strongest crop reductions are expected for legumes and maize as they are grown during the summer period.
• With 70 percent of agricultural production being rain-fed, the sector is highly vulnerable to temperature and precipitation changes and the associated potential consequences for food, social security, and rural livelihoods. Forty-three percent of the population lives in rural areas and poor rural farmers are particularly vulnerable to hunger and malnutrition as a direct consequence of yield loss and high food prices. In combination with non-climatic pressures the decline in rural livelihood options could trigger further urban migration, potentially exacerbating urban vulnerability and intensifying the potential for conflict.
• The increase in demand for irrigation water will be difficult to meet due to the simultaneous decrease in water availability in the Middle East and North Africa countries which have traditionally invested in agriculture to improve the performance in the agriculture sector—about 30 percent of the agricultural land is irrigated whereas agriculture consumes 60 to 90 percent of all water used in the region.
• Rising food prices that often follow production shocks and long-term declines make the growing number of urban poor increasingly vulnerable to malnutrition, particularly against the background of increasing local food insecurity. Evidence suggests that child malnutrition could rise in the event of significant food price increases or sharp declines in yields. Child malnutrition is already high in parts of the Middle East and North Africa, with an average of 18 percent of children under age five developmentally stunted. Childhood stunting has been linked to lifelong adverse consequences, including lower economic productivity in adulthood.
• With its high and growing import dependency the region is particularly vulnerable to worldwide and domestic agricultural impacts and related spikes in food prices. For example, climatic and hydrological events (droughts and floods), together with global market forces, were contributing factors to high wheat prices in Egypt and affected the price of bread in 2008.
Heat extremes will pose a significant challenge for human health
People in the region face a variety of health risks, many of which are exacerbated by the hot and arid conditions and relative water scarcity that characterize the region.
• A substantial rise in highly unusual heat extremes is expected in the coming decades. In a 2°C world, highly unusual heat extremes would occur on average in one of the summer months in each year from the 2040s onward. In a 4°C world, this frequency would be experienced as early as the 2030s, and would increase to two summer months by the 2060s and virtually all months by the end of the century. Unprecedented heat extremes are absent in a 2°C world and affect about half the summer months by the end of the century in a 4°C world.
• The period of consecutive hot days is expected to increase, particularly in cities due to the urban heat island effect. For
example, in a 2 °C warmer world the number of consecutive hot days is projected to increase annually from four days to about two months in Amman, from eight days to about three months in Baghdad, and from one day to two months in Damascus. The number of hot days in Riyadh is expected to increase even more—from about three days to over four months. The number of hot days in a 4°C warmer world is projected to exceed the equivalent of four months in most capital cities.
• Heat stress levels can approach the physiological limits of people working outdoors and severely undermine regional labor productivity, putting a burden on health infrastructure. High temperatures can cause heat-related illnesses (e.g., heat stress, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke) especially for the elderly, people with chronic diseases or obesity, and pregnant women, children, and people working outside. Climate change is expected to undermine human health in other ways as well. For instance, the relative risk of diarrheal disease as a consequence of climatic changes and deteriorating water quality is expected to increase 6-14 percent for the period 2010-39 and 16-38 percent for the period 2070-99 in North Africa; and 6-15 percent and 17-41 percent, respectively, in the Middle East.
Sea-level rise will pose serious challenges to the region’s coastal population, infrastructure, and economic assets.
The dense concentration of people and assets in coastal cities translate into high exposure to the effects of sea-level rise.
• Projections show that all coastlines are at risk from sea-level rise. Depending on the city, sea levels are projected to rise by 0.34-0.39 m in a 1.5°C world and 0.56-0.64 m in a 4°C world (medium estimate), with the highest estimate reaching
1.4 m in Muscat.
• The Maghreb countries of Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya have been identified as among the most exposed African countries in terms of total population affected by sea-level rise. In Morocco, for example, more than 60 percent of the population and over 90 percent of industry is located in key coastal cities. For example, Alexandria, Benghazi, and Algiers have been identified as particularly vulnerable to a sea-level rise of only 0.2 m by 2050. The United Arab Emirates also ranks among the ten most vulnerable countries to sea-level rise worldwide.
♦ Key impacts of climate change in coastal zones include inundation resulting from slow onset sea-level rise, flooding, and damages caused by extreme events (including storms, storm surges, and increased coastal erosion). The exposure of critical assets may cause other impacts to have repercussions for the economy (e.g., where tourism infrastructure is exposed). In Egypt, for example, the ocean acidification and ocean warming threatens coral reefs and is expected to place the tourism industry—an important source of income revenue—under severe pressure.
♦ Impacts on groundwater levels are significant, with potential negative repercussions on human health for local and migrant populations. The Nile Delta, home to more than 35 million people and providing 63 percent of Egypt's agricultural production, is especially vulnerable to salinization under changing climate conditions. These impacts will be exacerbated by land subsidence, especially in the eastern part of the delta, and by extensive landscape modification resulting from both coastal modification and changes in the Nile's hydrogeology.
Europe and Central Asia
Europe and Central Asia (ECA) in this report covers 12 countries11 within Central Asia, the Western Balkans, and the Russian Federation. The analysis focuses on specific climate challenges related
 
to the agriculture-water-energy nexus in Central Asia; climate extreme in the Western Balkans, and the forests in Russia. While the economic and political profiles of the countries differ greatly, a common denominator is their transition from various types of closed, planned economies to open, market-based systems. The region is characterized by relatively low levels of per-capita annual GDP, ranging from $800 in Tajikistan to $14,000 in Russia. Agricultural production plays an important role in the national economies of the region, particularly those of Tajikistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan, and Albania. Large portions of the population in Central Asia (60 percent) and the Western Balkans (45 percent) live in rural areas, making them dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods and thus particularly vulnerable to climate change.
    The parts of the Europe and Central Asia region covered by this report are projected to experience greater warming than the global average. The region displays a clear pattern where areas in the southwest are becoming drier and areas further northeast, including most of Central Asia, are becoming wetter as the world warms toward 4°C. The projected temperature and precipitation changes translate into increased risks for freshwater supplies that not only jeopardizes the sustainability of hydropower and agricultural productivity but also negatively impacts ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration for most of the region. A selection of sub-regional impacts is provided in Box 6.
 Water resources in Central Asia increase during the first half of the century and decline thereafter,; amplifying the challenge of accommodating competing water demands for agricultural production and hydropower generation.
 Water resource systems in Central Asia (notably glaciers and snow pack) are sensitive to projected warming; with consequent impacts on water availability in the agriculture and energy sectors.

Box 6: Selected Climate Risks in the Europe and Central Asia Region
Increasing precipitation and glacial melt lead to Increased water availability and flood risk In Central Asia In the coming decades. After mid-century and especially with warming leading to a 4°C world, unstable water availability poses a risk for agriculture and competing demands for hydropower generation. In the Western Balkans, extreme heat with a strong decrease In precipitation and water availability are projected to lead to large reductions In crop yields, adverse effects on human health, and Increasing risks to energy generation for a 4°C world; but would already be present In a 2°C world. The Russian forests store enormous amounts of carbon In biomass and soils. While their productivity may generally Increase with warmer temperatures, large-scale forest dieback and the release of carbon resulting from Interacting heat stress, Insect spread and fire, have the potential to further affect boreal forests In the second half of the century.



Western Balkans
Increase In droughts, unusual heat extremes and flooding. High risks for agriculture, human health and stable hydropower generation.
Risks for human health, food and energy security
 
Central Asia
 Increasing glacial melt alters river runoff. Risks of glacial lake outbursts, flooding and seasonal water shortages. Increasing competition for water resources due to rising agricultural water demand and demand for energy production.
 Risks for poor through rising food prices particularly affecting women, children and the urban poor Risks for human health due to spreading disease, heat waves and flooding.

Boreal Forests of the Russian Federation
 Unusual heat extremes and annual precipitation Increase, rising risks of forest fires and spread of pests leading to tree mortality and decreasing forest productivity. Possible northward shift of treeline and changes In species composition. Risks of permafrost melt and methane release.
Risk for timber production and ecosystem services, including carbon capture. Risks of substantial carbon and methane emissions.






Central Asia is increasingly likely to be a hotspot for heat stress for agriculture and human settlements as warming proceeds to 2°C and 4°C especially as temperatures are not moderated by oceanic winds. Since the beginning of the 20th century. Central Asian glaciers have already seen a one-third reduction in glacier volume. Glacier volume is projected to decline by about 50 percent in a 2°C world, concurrent with a 25 percent decrease in snow cover for the Northern Hemisphere, and by up to 80 percent in a 4°C world. Reductions in water availability are predicted to occur contemporaneously with an increase in demand for irrigation water.
• River runoff will increase in the coming decades due to enhanced glacial melt rates but flows are expected to decrease for the second half of the century. By the end of
the 21st century a distinct decrease in the water volume of the Syr Darya, and an even more distinct decrease in the Amu Darya River, is expected because of declining glaciers that supply most of its flows. Critically, also the timing of high flow volumes changes. For example, available data for a headwater catchment (Panj) of the Amu Darya River reveal that the timing of peak flows is projected to shift toward spring, leading to a 25 percent reduction in discharge during the mid-summer (July-August) period in a 3°C world. As a result, less water will be available for agriculture during the crop-growing season while at the same time higher summer temperatures lead to higher water demand for plants.
• Crop productivity is expected to be negatively impacted by increased heat extremes and variability of supply/demand for water that poses substantial risks to irrigated agricultural systems. Rain-fed agriculture is likely to be affected by uncertain rainfall patterns and amounts, including where irrigation is important, and coupled with rising maximum temperatures can lead to the risk of heat stress and crop failure.
• Rural populations that are especially dependent on agriculture for food are likely to be increasingly vulnerable to
any reductions in agricultural yields and nutritional quality of their staple food grains.
• Unstable water availability is likely to increase the challenge of competing requirements for hydropower generation and agricultural production at times of rising overall demand due to projected population and economic growth in Central Asia. The projected increase in highly unusual and unprecedented heat extremes during the summer months (see Figure 4) can be expected to simultaneously increase energy demand. As the efficiency of hydropower plants depends on inter- and intra-annually stable river runoff, the potential, for example, of installed hydropower plants for small catchments is projected to decrease by 13 percent in Turkmenistan and by 19 percent in the Kyrgyz Republic at around 2°C warming by the 2050s, while an increase of nearly seven percent is projected for Kazakhstan. Overall, energy demand is projected to rise together with population and economic growth.
• Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, which are located upstream of the Syr Daria and Amu Darya, produce nearly 99 percent and 93 percent, respectively, of the total electricity consumed from hydropower. These upstream countries would have to manage the impact of climate change on their hydropower generation capacity, which is the backbone of their power systems; downstream countries (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan), meanwhile, would be hit particularly hard by competing demands for agricultural and energy production.
Climate extremes in the Western Balkans pose major risks to agricultural systems, energy and human health.
The Western Balkans are particularly exposed to the effects of extreme events, including heat, droughts, and flooding. Heat extremes will be the new norm for the Western Balkans in a 4°C world. In a 2°C world, highly unusual heat extremes are projected for nearly a third of all summer months compared to virtually all summer months in a 4°C world. Unprecedented heat extremes are projected to occur for 5-10 percent of summer months in a 2°C world compared to about two-thirds of summer months in a 4°C world.
• The risk of drought is high. Projections indicate a 20 percent increase in the number of drought days and a decrease in precipitation of about 20-30 percent in a 4°C world.
Projections for a 2°C world are uncertain. At the same time, projections suggest an increase in riverine flood risk, mainly in spring and winter, caused by more intense snow melt in spring and increased rainfall in the winter months (precipitation projections are, however, particularly uncertain).
• Most crops are rain-fed and very vulnerable to projected climate change. While there are no projections that encompass the entire region, and projections for individual countries remain uncertain, clear risks emerge. For example, projections for FYR Macedonia indicate potential yield losses of up to 50 percent for maize, wheat, vegetables, and grapes for around 2°C global warming by 2050. Pasture yields and grassland ecosystems for livestock grazing may be affected by sustained drought and heat, and decline over large parts of the Western Balkans. The effects of extreme events on agricultural production are mostly not included in assessments, but observations indicate high vulnerability.
• Energy systems are very vulnerable to extreme events and changes in river water temperatures; changing seasonality of river flows can further impact hydropower production.
Most countries in the Western Balkans depend on hydroelectric sources for at least one-fifth of their electricity production. Reductions in electricity production would be concurrent with an increase in cooling demand which is projected to increase by 49 percent in a 4°C world.
• Extreme climate events and the appearance of new disease vectors pose serious risks to human health. The increased incidence and intensity of extreme heat events could cause the seasonality of temperature-related mortality to shift from winter to summer across continental Europe. Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are considered particularly vulnerable to heat waves. The net total number of temperature-related deaths is projected to increase for the period 2050-2100 above 2°C warming levels. Further health risks are likely due to climate change resulting in favorable conditions for the insect vectors transmitting diseases, such as dengue fever and Chikungunya fever.
Impacts of projected warming on Russian boreal forests and the permafrost can have severe consequences for forest productivity and global carbon stocks.
The boreal ecosystems of the Russian Federation that account for about 20 percent of the world's forest cover large permafrost regions (carbon and methane-rich frozen soil layers) are likely to be quite sensitive to projected warming and heat extremes. Perturbations to the forest or permafrost could result in severe consequences for local ecosystem services and the global carbon budget. Although slightly warmer average temperatures may increase forest productivity, there is a risk of increasing disturbances, such as fires and pests, leading to widespread tree mortality.
   Above-average temperature rises and an overall increase in annual precipitation is projected. In a 2°C world, highly unusual heat extremes are projected to occur in 5-10 percent of summer months, increasing to 50 percent of all summer months in a 4°C world. Precipitation is expected to increase by 10-30 percent in a 2°C world and by 20-60 percent in a 4°C world. Permafrost in the region is highly vulnerable to warming, with projected permafrost thawing rate of 10-15 percent over Russia by 2050 in a 2°C world.
• A northward shift of the tree line is projected in response to warming, causing boreal forests to spread into the northern tundra zone, temperate forests into the present boreal zone, and steppes (grassland plains) into temperate forests. In a 4°C world the Eurasian boreal forest area would reduce around 19 percent and the temperate forest area increase by over 250 percent. With warming limited to around 1.5°C, boreal forests would decrease by around two percent and the temperate forest area would increase by 140 percent. This would lead to a net gain in total temperate and boreal forest area in Eurasia of seven percent in a 4°C world and 12 percent in a
1.5 °C world. The potential carbon gains from the expansion of boreal forests in the north are likely to be offset, however, by losses in the south.


• At lower latitudes the forest is likely to give way to steppe ecosystems. If (partly uncertain) C02 fertilization effects do not enhance water-use efficiency sufficiently, the risk of fire, particularly in southern Siberia and Central Yakutia, will increase and could lead to increased carbon emissions. Projections for this area indicate an increase in the annual number of high fire danger days of an average of 10 days in a 3°C world, and 20-30 days in a 4°C world. The effects of heat waves promoting forest fires, and the increasing spread of pests and diseases, as well as the interaction of these factors, may lead to decreased productivity and even increased tree mortality.
• In a 2°C world, the thawing of the permafrost is projected to increase methane emissions by 20-30 percent. The
projected perturbations to Russian forest ecosystems are of global importance. If pushed beyond critical thresholds and into positive feedback with regional and global warming, large carbon stocks in the boreal forests and methane in the permafrost zones may be released into the atmosphere—with major implications for the global carbon budget.
Consequences for Development
Climate change risks undermining development and poverty reduction for present and future generations
 Climate change poses a substantial and escalating risk to development progress that could undermine global efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. Without strong, early action, warming could exceed 1.5-2°C and the resulting impacts could significantly worsen intra- and inter-generational poverty in multiple regions across the globe.
    Severe threats to development outlined in this report are beginning to occur across many sectors in all three regions. The analysis presented in this report reveals that amplified risks are emerging from multi-sectoral impacts in particular connected to food security due to projected large and severe crop yield losses for warming levels above 2°C.
    As warming approaches 4°C very severe impacts can be expected to trigger impact cascades crossing critical thresholds of environmental and human support systems. Climatic conditions, heat and other weather extremes considered highly unusual or unprecedented today would become the new climate normal—a world of increased risks and instability.
    Every effort must be made to cut greenhouse gas emissions from our cities, land use, and energy systems now and transition to a clean, low carbon pathway. Action is urgently needed on climate change, but it does not have to come at the expense of economic growth. Immediate steps are also needed to help countries build resilience and adapt to the climate impacts being felt today and the unavoidable consequences of a rapidly warming world over the coming decades.

Glossary


Aridity Index: The Aridity Index (AI) is an indicator designed for identifying structurally arid regions; that is, regions with a longterm average precipitation deficit. AI is defined as total annual precipitation divided by potential évapotranspiration, with the latter a measure of the amount of water a representative crop type would need as a function of local conditions such as temperature, incoming radiation, and wind speed, over a year to grow, which is a standardized measure of water demand.
Biome: A biome is a large geographical area of distinct plant and animal groups, one of a limited set of major habitats classified by climatic and predominant vegetative types. Biomes include, for example, grasslands, deserts, evergreen or deciduous forests, and tundra. Many different ecosystems exist within each broadly defined biome, all of which share the limited range of climatic and environmental conditions within that biome.
C3/C4 plants: C3 and C4 refer to two types of photosynthetic biochemical pathways. C3 plants include more than 85 percent of plants (e.g., most trees, wheat, rice, yams, and potatoes) and respond well to moist conditions and to additional C02 in the atmosphere. C4 plants (e.g., savanna grasses, maize, sorghum, millet, and sugarcane) are more efficient in water and energy use and outperform C3 plants in hot and dry conditions.
CAT: The Climate Action Tracker is an independent, science- based assessment that tracks the emissions commitments of and actions by individual countries. The estimates of future emissions deducted from this assessment serve to analyze warming scenarios that could result from current policy: (i) CAT Reference BAU: a lower reference business-as-usual scenario that includes existing climate policies but not pledged emissions reductions; and (ii) CAT Current Pledges: a scenario additionally incorporating reductions currently pledged internationally by countries.

C02 fertilization: The C02 fertilization effect refers to the effect of increased levels of atmospheric C02 on plant growth. It may increase the rate of photosynthesis mainly in C3 plants and increase water use efficiency, thereby causing increases in agricultural productivity in grain mass and/or number. This effect may to some extent offset the negative impacts of climate change on crop yields, although grain protein content may decline. Long-term effects are uncertain as they heavily depend on a potential physiological long-term acclimation to elevated C02 and other limiting factors, including soil nutrients, water, and light. (See also Box 2.4 on the C02 fertilization effect on crop productivity.)
CMIP5: The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) brought together 20 state-of-the-art GCM groups, which generated a large set of comparable climate-projection data. The project provided a framework for coordinated climate change experiments and includes simulations for assessment in the IPCC AR5.
Development narratives: Development narratives highlight the implications of climate change impacts on regional development. The Turn Down the Heat series, and in particular this report, discuss the potential climate change impacts on particularly vulnerable groups along distinct storylines—the so called development narratives. These development narratives were developed for each region in close cooperation with regional World Bank specialists. They provide an integrated, often cross- sectoral analysis of climate change impacts and development implications at the sub-regional or regional level. Furthermore, the development narratives add to the report by allowing the science-based evidence of physical and biophysical impacts to be drawn out into robust development storylines to characterize the plausible scenarios of risks and opportunities—showcasing how science and policy interface.






GCM: A General Circulation Model is the most advanced type of climate model used for projecting changes in climate due to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, aerosols, and external forcing (like changes in solar activity and volcanic eruptions). These models contain numerical representations of physical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and land surface on a global three-dimensional grid, with the current generation of GCMs having a typical horizontal resolution of 100-300 km.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product is the sum of the gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the product. It is calculated without deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.
GDP PPP: This is GDP on a purchasing power parity basis divided by population. Whereas PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often rough approximations.
Highly unusual and Unprecedented: In this report, highly unusual and unprecedented heat extremes are defined using thresholds based on the historical variability of the current local climate. The absolute level of the threshold depends on the natural year-to-year variability in the base period (1951-1980), which is captured by the standard deviation (sigma). Highly unusual heat extremes are defined as 3-sigma events. For a normal distribution,
3- sigma events have a return time of 740 years. The 2012 U.S. heat wave and the 2010 Russian heat wave classify as 3-sigma and thus highly unusual events. Unprecedented heat extremes are defined as 5-sigma events. They have a return time of several million years. Monthly temperature data do not necessarily follow a normal distribution (for example, the distribution can have long tails, making warm events more likely) and the return times can be different from the ones expected in a normal distribution. Nevertheless, 3-sigma events are extremely unlikely and 5-sigma events have almost certainly never occurred over the lifetime of key ecosystems and human infrastructure.
Hyper-aridity: This refers to land areas with very low Aridity Index (AI) scores, generally coinciding with the great deserts. There is no universally standardized value for hyper-aridity, and values between 0 and 0.05 are classified in this report as hyper-arid.
IPCC AR4, AR5: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading body of global climate change assessments. It comprises hundreds of leading scientists worldwide and on a regular basis publishes assessment reports which provide a comprehensive overview of the most recent scientific, technical, and socioeconomic information on climate change and its implications.

The Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) was published in 2007. The Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) was published in 2013/2014.
ISI-MIP: The first Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) is a community-driven modeling effort which provides cross-sectoral global impact assessments based on the newly developed climate Representative Concentration Pathways and socioeconomic scenarios. More than 30 models across five sectors (agriculture, water resources, biomes, health, and infrastructure) were incorporated in this modeling exercise.
Pre-industrial Level (what it means to have present 0.8°C warming) : Pre-industrial level refers to the level of warming before/at the onset of industrialization. The instrumental temperature records show that the 20-year average of global-mean, near-surface air temperature in 1986-2005 was about 0.6°C higher than the average over 1851-1879. There are, however, considerable year-to-year variations and uncertainties in the data. In addition, the 20-year average warming over 1986-2005 is not necessarily representative of present-day warming. Fitting a linear trend over the period 1901-2010 gives a warming of 0.8°C since “early industrialization.” Global mean, near-surface air temperatures in the instrumental records of surface-air temperature have been assembled dating back to about 1850. The number of measurement stations in the early years is small and increases rapidly with time. Industrialization was well on its way by 1850 and 1900, which implies using 1851-1879 as a base period, or 1901 as a start for linear trend analysis might lead to an underestimate of current and future warming. However, global greenhouse-gas emissions at the end of the 19th century were still small and uncertainties in temperature reconstructions before this time are considerably larger.
RCP: Representative Concentration Pathways are based on carefully selected scenarios for work on integrated assessment modeling, climate modeling, and modeling and analysis of impacts. Nearly a decade of new economic data, information about emerging technologies, and observations of such environmental factors as land use and land cover change are reflected in this work. Rather than starting with detailed socioeconomic storylines to generate emissions scenarios, the RCPs are consistent sets of projections of only the components of radiative forcing (the change in the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation to the atmosphere caused primarily by changes in atmospheric composition) that are meant to serve as inputs for climate modeling. These radiative forcing trajectories are not associated with unique socioeconomic or emissions scenarios; instead, they can result from different combinations of economic, technological, demographic, policy, and institutional futures. RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5 refer respectively, to a radiative forcing of +2.6 W/m2, +4.5 W/m2, + 6 W/m2 and +8.5 W/m2 in the year 2100 relative to preindustrial conditions.
RCP2.6: RCP2.6 refers to a scenario which is representative of the literature on mitigation scenarios aiming to limit the increase of global mean temperature to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This emissions path is used by many studies that have been assessed for the IPCC 5th Assessment Report and is the underlying low emissions scenario for impacts assessed in other parts of this report. In this report, the RCP2.6 is referred to as a 2°C world (with the exception of sea-level rise, where the subset of model used actually leads to 1.5°C world—see Box 2.1, Definition of Warming Levels and Base Period in this Report).
RCP8.5: RCP8.5 refers to a scenario with a no-climate-policy baseline with comparatively high greenhouse gas emissions which is used by many studies that have been assessed for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). This scenario is also the underlying high-emissions scenario for impacts assessed in other parts of this report. In this report, the RCP8.5 is referred to as a 4°C world above the pre-industrial baseline period.
Severe and extreme: These terms indicate uncommon (negative) consequences. These terms are often associated with an additional qualifier like “highly unusual” or “unprecedented” that has a specific quantified meaning.
SRES: The Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, published by the IPCC in 2000, has provided the climate projections for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The scenarios do not include mitigation assumptions. The SRES study included consideration of 40 different scenarios, each making different assumptions about the driving forces determining future greenhouse gas emissions. Scenarios were grouped into four families (A1FI, A2, B1 and B2), corresponding to a wide range of high- and low-emissions scenarios.
SREX: The IPCC published a special report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) in 2012. The report provides an assessment of the physical and social factors shaping vulnerability to climate- related disasters and gives an overview of the potential for effective disaster risk management.
Tipping element: Following Lenton et al. (2008), the term tipping element describes large scale components of the Earth system possibly passing a tipping point. A tipping point “commonly refers to a critical threshold at which a tiny perturbation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system” (Lenton et al. 2008). The consequences of such shifts for societies and ecosystems are likely to be severe.
Virtual water: A measure of the water resources used in the production of agricultural commodities. International trade in such commodities thereby implies a transfer of virtual water resources from one country to another embedded in the products.
WGI, WGII, WG III: IPCC Working Group I assesses the physical scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. IPCC Working Group II assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, negative and positive consequences of climate change, and options for adapting to it. IPCC Working Group III assesses the options for mitigating climate change through limiting or preventing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing activities that remove them from the atmosphere.

Executive summary
There is now strong evidence that the earths climate is changing rapidly, mainly due to human activities. Increasing temperatures, sea-level rises, changing patterns of precipitation, and more frequent and severe extreme events are expected to have largely adverse effects on key determinants of human health, including clean air and water, sufficient food and adequate shelter.
The effects of climate on human society, and our ability to mitigate and adapt to them, are mediated by social factors, including gender. This report provides a first review of the interactions between climate change, gender and health. It documents evidence for gender differences in health risks that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change, and in adaptation and mitigation measures that can help to protect and promote health. The aim is to provide a framework to strengthen World Health Organization (WHO) support to Member States in developing health risk assessments and climate policy interventions that are beneficial to both women and men.
Many of the health risks that are likely to be affected by ongoing climate change show gender differentials. Globally, natural disasters such as droughts, floods and storms kill more women than men, and tend to kill women at a younger age. These effects also interact with the nature of the event and social status. The gender-gap effects on life expectancy tend to be greater in more severe disasters, and in places where the socioeconomic status of women is particularly low. Other climate-sensitive health impacts, such as undernutrition and malaria, also show important gender differences.
Gender differences occur in health risks that are directly associated with meteorological hazards. These differences reflect a combined effect of physiological, behavioural and socially constructed influences. For example, the majority of European studies have shown that women are more at risk, in both relative and absolute terms, of dying in heatwaves. However, other studies have also shown that unmarried men tend to be at greater risk than unmarried women, and that social isolation, particularly of elderly men, may be a risk factor.
Differences are also found in vulnerability to the indirect and longer-term effects of climate- related hazards. For example, droughts in developing countries bring health hazards through reduced availability of water for drinking, cooking and hygiene, and through food insecurity. Women and girls (and their offspring) disproportionately suffer health consequences of nutritional deficiencies and the burdens associated with travelling further to collect water. In contrast, in both developed and developing countries, there is evidence that drought can disproportionately increase suicide rates among male farmers.
Women and men differ in their roles, behaviours and attitudes regarding actions that could help to mitigate climate change. Surveys show that in many countries men consume more energy than women, particularly for private transport, while women are often responsible for most of the household consumer decisions, including in relation to food, water and household energy. There is also evidence of gender differences in relation to the health and safety risks of new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Such information could support more targeted, more effective efforts to bring about more healthy and environmentally friendly policies.
These differences are also reflected in the health implications of potential greenhouse gas mitigation policies. For example, inefficient burning of biomass in unventilated homes releases high levels of black carbon, causing approximately 2 million deaths a year, mainly of women and children in the poorest communities in the world. The black carbon from such burning is also a significant contributor to local and regional warming. At the household level, women are sometimes critical decision-makers in terms of consumption patterns and therefore the main beneficiaries of access to cleaner energy sources.
Resources, attitudes and strategies to respond to weather-related hazards often differ between women and men. For example, studies in India have shown that women tend to have much lower access to critical information on weather alerts and cropping patterns, affecting their capacity to respond effectively to climate variability. The same study showed that when confronted with long-term weather shifts, men show a greater preference to migrate, while women show a greater preference for wage labour.
Evidence from case studies suggests that incorporation of a gender analysis can increase the effectiveness of measures to protect people from climate variability and change. In particular, women make an important contribution to disaster reduction, usually informally through participating in disaster management and acting as agents of social change. Many disaster- response programmes and some early warning initiatives now place particular emphasis on engaging women as key actors.
There are important opportunities to adapt to climate change and to enhance health equity. Approaches to adaptation have evolved from initial infrastructure-based interventions to a more development-oriented approach that aims to build broader resilience to climate hazards. This includes addressing the underlying causes of vulnerability, such as poverty, lack of empowerment, and weaknesses in health care, education, social safety nets and gender equity. These are also some of the most important social determinants of health and health equity.
Gender-sensitive assessments and gender-responsive interventions have the potential to enhance health and health equity and to provide more effective climate change mitigation and adaptation. Gender-sensitive research, including collection, analysis and reporting of sex-disaggregated data, is needed to better understand the health implications of climate change and climate policies. However, there is already sufficient information to support gender mainstreaming in climate policies, alongside empowerment of individuals to build their own resilience, a clear focus on adaptation and mitigation, a strong commitment (including of resources), and sustainable and equitable development.
“Climate change affects every aspect of society, from the health of the global economy to the health of our children. It is about the water in our wells and in our taps. It is about the food on the table and at the core of nearly all the major challenges we face today.”

1. Background
Gender impacts of climate change have been identified as an issue requiring greater attention by the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW).2 Gender norms, roles and relations (Box 1) are important factors in determining vulnerability and adaptive capacity to the health impacts of climate change (Box 2). Womens and mens vulnerability to the impact of extreme climate events is determined not only by biology but also by differences in their social roles and responsibilities (Easterling, 2000; Wisner et al., 2004). Although they vary, these roles and responsibilities exist in all societies. The expectation that women fulfil their roles and responsibilities as carers of their families often places extra burdens on them during extreme climate events. The expected role of men as economic providers for their families often places extra burdens on them in the aftermath of such events.
Box 1 : Definition of sex and gender
In this document “sex” refers to the biological and physiological characteristics of women and men, and “gender” refers to the socially constructed norms, roles and relations that a given society considers appropriate for men and women. Gender determines what is expected, permitted and valued in a woman or a man in a determined context.
Source: WHO (2011a).
Box 2: Definition of climate change
Climate has always varied due to natural influences; however, there is now strong evidence that human actions, principally the burning of fossil fuels, are the main drivers of the recent increase in global temperatures and also affect precipitation patterns and extreme weather events.
This document follows the definition adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in which “climate change” refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. This usage differs from that in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which defines “climate change” as “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods”.
Source: IPCC (2001a).

At the 2007 World Health Assembly (WHA), Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted Resolution WHA 60.25 on the integration of gender analysis and actions into the work of WHO at all levels (WHO, 2007). A year later, at the 2008 WHA, 193 WHO Member States committed through Resolution 61.19 to a series of actions to confront the health risks associated with climate change (WHO, 2008a).
The overall aim of this work is to provide a framework for gendered health risk assessment and adaptation/mitigation actions in relation to climate change. This aims to strengthen WHO support to Member States in developing standardized country-level health risk assessments and climate policy interventions that are beneficial to both women and men.
This report therefore adopts a risk-assessment approach in considering the existing evidence for gender differences in vulnerability. Climate change is a long-term process, acting against a background of shorter-term climate variability and many other influences on health. Under these circumstances, direct statistical attribution of even very large gender differences in health effects would generally require high-quality meteorological, health and other data collected over many years, and will therefore only be possible for a minority of effects, in specific locations. In contrast, there is strong evidence of gender differences in the health impacts of short-term climate variability and climate-sensitive conditions, such as malnutrition and incidence of infectious diseases. We use this information to assess likely gender differences in health risks and responses over the longer time periods associated with climate change.
1.1 Health and climate change
Effects of climate change on health will impact on most populations in the coming decades and put the lives and well-being of billions of people at increased risk (Costello et al, 2009). IPCC states that “climate change is projected to increase threats to human health”.
Climate change can affect human health through a range of mechanisms. These include relatively direct effects of hazards such as heatwaves, floods and storms, and more complex pathways of altered infectious disease patterns, disruptions of agricultural and other supportive ecosystems, and potentially population displacement and conflict over depleted resources, such as water, fertile land and fisheries (Pachauri & Reisinger, 2007).
There is no clear dividing line between these divisions, and each pathway is also modulated by non-climatic determinants and human actions.
1.2 Health, gender and climate change
Limited case examples and research have analysed and highlighted the links between gender norms, roles, relations and health impacts of climate change (Box 3). The framework in Figure 1, adapted from the synthesis report of the International Scientific Congress on Climate Change (McMichael & Bertollini, 2009), is used in this paper to structure the available information on the gendered health implications of climate change, according to (i) the direct and indirect health impacts of meteorological conditions; (ii) the health implications of potential societal effects of climate change, for example on livelihoods, agriculture and migration; and (iii) capacities, resources, behaviours and attitudes related to health adaptation measures and mitigation policies that have health implications.

Box 3: Why gender and health?
The distinct roles and relations of men and women in a given culture, dictated by that culture’s gender norms and values, give rise to gender differences.
Gender norms, roles and relations also give rise to gender inequalities - that is, differences between men and women that systematically value one group often to the detriment of the other. The fact that, throughout the world, women on average have lower cash incomes than men is an example of gender inequality.
Both gender differences and gender inequalities can give rise to inequities between men and women in health status and access to health care. For example:
• a woman cannot receive needed health care because norms in her community prevent her from travelling alone to a clinic;
• an adolescent boy dies in an accident because of trying to live up to his peers’ expectations that young men should be “bold” risk-takers, including on the road.
In each of these cases, gender norms and values, and resulting behaviours, are negatively affecting health. But gender norms and values are not fixed and can evolve over time, can vary substantially from place to place, and are subject to change. Thus, the adverse health consequences resulting from gender differences and gender inequalities are not static. They can be changed.

2. Impacts: health
2.1 Meteorological conditions and human exposure
There is good evidence showing that women and men suffer different negative health consequences following extreme events such as floods, windstorms, droughts and heatwaves. A review of census information on the effects of natural disasters across 141 countries showed that although disasters create hardships for everyone, on average they kill more women than men, or kill women at a younger age than men. These differences persist in proportion to the severity of disasters and depend on the relative socioeconomic status of women in the affected country. This effect is strongest in countries where women have very low social, economic and political status. In countries where women have comparable status to men, natural disasters affect men and women almost equally (Neumayer & Plümper, 20oylhe same study highlighted that physical differences between men and women are unlikely to explain these differences, and social norms may provide some additional explanation. The study also looked at the specific vulnerability of girls and women with respect to mortality from natural disasters and their aftermath; the study found that natural disasters lower the life expectancy in women more than in men. Since life expectancy of women is generally higher than that of men, natural disasters actually narrow the gender gap in life expectancy in most countries. The research also confirmed that the effect on the gender gap in life expectancy is proportional to the severity of disasters - that is, major calamities lead to more severe impacts on women's life expectancy compared with that of men. The study verified that the effect of the gender gap on the gender gap in life expectancy varied inversely in relation to womens socioeconomic status. This highlights the socially constructed and gender-specific vulnerability of women to natural disasters, which is integral to everyday socioeconomic patterns and leads to relatively higher disaster-related mortality rates in women compared with men (Neumayer & Plümper, 2007).
2.1.1 Heatwaves and increased hot weather
Warming and increased humidity have already contributed to observed increases in some health risks, and these can be anticipated to continue in the future.
Direct consequences
Several studies, mainly in cities in developed countries, have shown that death rates increase as temperatures depart, in either direction, from the optimum temperature for that population. There is therefore concern that although warmer temperatures may lead to fewer deaths in winter, they are likely to increase summer mortality. For example, it is estimated that a 2 °C rise would increase the annual death rate from heatwaves in many cities by approximately twofold (McMichael & Bertollini, 2009). There is evidence that vulnerability varies by sex: more women than men died during the 2003 European heatwave, and the majority of European studies have shown that women are more at risk, in both relative and absolute terms, of dying in such events (Kovats & Hajat, 2008). There may be some physiological reasons for an increased risk among elderly women (Burse, 1979; Havenith et al., 1998). Social factors can also be important in determining the risk of negative impacts of heatwaves. For example, in the United States of America, elderly men seem to be more at risk than women in heatwaves, and this was particularly apparent in the Chicago events of July 1995 (Semenza, 1996; Whitman et al., 1997). This vulnerability may be due to the level of social isolation among elderly men (Klinenberg, 2002). In Paris, France the heatwave-related risk increased for unmarried men but not for unmarried women (Canoui-Poitrine et al., 2006). Men may also be more at risk of heatstroke mortality because they are more likely than women to be active in hot weather (CDC, 2006).
Indirect consequences
Rising temperatures may increase the transmission of malaria in some locations, which already causes 300 million acute illnesses and kills almost 1 million people every year (WHO, 2008b). Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to malaria as they are twice as “appealing” as non-pregnant women to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. A study that compared the relative “attractiveness” to mosquitoes of pregnant and non-pregnant women in rural Gambia found that the mechanisms underlying this vulnerability during pregnancy is likely to be related to at least two physiological factors. First, women in the advanced stages of pregnancy (mean gestational age 28 weeks or above) produce more exhaled breath (on average, 21% more volume) than their non-pregnant counterparts. There are several hundred different components in human breath, some of which help mosquitoes detect a host. At close range, body warmth, moist convection currents, host odours and visual stimuli allow the insect to locate its target. During pregnancy, blood flow to the skin increases, which helps heat dissipation, particularly in the hands and feet. The study also found that the abdomen of pregnant women was on average 0.7 °C hotter than that of non-pregnant women and that there may be an increase in the release of volatile substances from the skin surface and a larger host signature that allows mosquitoes to detect them more readily at close range. Changes in behaviour in pregnant women can also increase exposure to night-biting mosquitoes: pregnant women leave the protection of their bednet at night to urinate twice as frequently as non-pregnant women. Although the important role of immunity and nutrition is recognized, it is suggested that physiological and behavioural changes that occur during pregnancy could partly explain this increased risk of infection (Lindsay, 2000). Maternal malaria increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature delivery, stillbirth and low birth weight.
Evidence for connections between weather and pre-eclampsia varies between studies. Some studies have looked at links between meteorological conditions and the incidence of eclampsia in pregnancy; the studies found increased incidence during climatic conditions characterized by low temperature, high humidity or high precipitation, with an increased incidence especially during the first few months of the rainy season (Agobe et al., 1981; Crowther, 1985; Faye et al., 1991; Bergstroem et al., 1992; Neela & Raman, 1993; Obed et al., 1994; Subramaniam, 2007). A study from Kuwait found that incidence of pre-eclampsia was high in November, when the temperature was low and the humidity high (Makhseed et al., 1993). On the other hand, the incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension was highest in June, when the temperature was very high and the humidity at its lowest. Another study, from the southern province of Zimbabwe, evaluated hypertensive complications during pregnancy and observed a distinctive change in the incidence of pre-eclampsia during the year. These changes corresponded with the seasonal variation in precipitation, with incidence increasing at the end of the dry season and in the first months of the rainy season. This observed relationship between season and the occurrence of pre-eclampsia raises new questions regarding the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Possible explanations could be the impact of humidity and temperature on production of vasoactive substances. Dry and rainy seasons, through their influence on agricultural yields, may also impact on the nutritional status and play a role in the pathophysiology of the women (Wacker et ah, 1998).
 2.1.2 Windstorms and tropical cyclones
 Direct consequences
 In the 1991 cyclone disasters that killed 140 000 people in Bangladesh, 90% of victims were women (Aguilar, 2004). The death rate among people aged 20-44 years was 71 per 1000 women, compared with 15 per 1000 men (WEDO, 2008). Explanations for this include the fact that more women than men are homebound, looking after children and valuables. Even if a warning is issued, many women die while waiting for their relatives to return home to accompany them to a safe place. Other reasons include the sari restricts the movement of women and puts them more at risk at the time of a tidal surge, and that women are less well nourished and hence physically less able than men to deal with these situations (Chowdhury et al., 1993; WEDO, 2008).
 In May 2008, Cyclone Nargis came ashore in the Ayeyarwady Division of Myanmar. Among the 130 000 people dead or missing in the aftermath, 61% were female (Care Canada, 2010).
 Indirect consequences
 Women, young people, and people with low socioeconomic status are thought to be at comparatively high risk of anxiety and mood disorders after disasters (Norris et al., 2002). One study of anxiety and mood disorder (as defined by the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; DSM-IV) after Hurricane Katrina found the incidence was consistently associated with the following factors: age under 60 years; being a woman; education level lower than college completion; low family income; pre-hurricane employment status (largely unemployed and disabled); and being unmarried. In addition, Hispanic people and people of other racial/ethnic minorities (not including non-Hispanic black people) had a significantly lower estimated incidence of any disorder compared with non-Hispanic white people in the New Orleans area, as well as a significantly lower estimated prevalence of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the remainder of the sample. These same associations have been found in community epidemiological surveys in the absence of disasters, suggesting that these associations might be related to pre-existing conditions (Galea et al., 2007). A follow-up study that looked at patterns and correlates of recovery from hurricane-related PTSD, broader anxiety and mood disorders and suicidal behaviour found a high prevalence of hurricane- related mental illness widely distributed in the population nearly 2 years after the hurricane (Kessler et al., 2008).
 2.1.3 Sea-level rises, heavy rain and flooding
 Increasing temperatures are contributing to sea-level rises, and precipitation is becoming heavier and more variable in many regions, potentially increasing flood risks and multiple associated health hazards. There has, however, been only limited systematic research and gender analysis on the health outcomes of flooding (Few et al., 2004). It is important to recognize that vulnerability to flooding is differentiated by social dimensions. In both developing and industrialized nations, health and other impacts may fall disproportionately on women, children, people with disabilities and elderly people (Few et al., 2004).

Direct consequences
A report on the health effects of climate change in the United Kingdom showed that age- and gender-related information on flood deaths is incomplete. Published reviews have shown, however, that men are much more at risk of drowning than women, probably due to taking more risky or “heroic” behaviour (Kovats & Allen, 2008) (Box 4).
Saline contamination is expected to be aggravated by climate change and sea-level rises (Nicholls et al., 2007). A paper on saline contamination of drinking water in Bangladesh indicated that large numbers of pregnant women in coastal areas are being diagnosed with preeclampsia, eclampsia and hypertension. Although local doctors and community representatives have blamed the problem on increased salinity, no formal epidemiological study has been done (Khan et al., 2008).
Box 4: How gender norms, roles and relations explain the differences in fatality between women and men in floods in Nepal
In 1993 a severe flash flood devastated the district of Sarlahi in the southern plains of Nepal. After an unprecedented 24-hour rainfall, a protective barrage on the Bagmati River was washed away during the night, sending a wall of water more than 7 metres high crashing through communities and killing more than 1600 people. Two months later, a follow-up survey assessed the impact of the flood. This survey was unusual in that an existing prospective research database was available to verify residency before the flood. As part of a large community-based nutrition programme, longitudinal data existed on children aged 2-9 years and their parents from 20 000 households, about 60% of the households in the study area. The survey established age- and sex-specific flood-related deaths among more than 40 000 registered participants (including deaths due to injury or illness in the weeks after the flood). Flood-related fatalities were 13.3 per 1000 girls aged 2-9 years, 9.4 per 1000 boys aged 2-9 years, 6.1 per 1000 adult women and 4.1 per 1000 adult men. The difference between boys’ and girls’ fatalities existed mostly among children under 5 years of age. This possibly reflects the gender-discriminatory practices that are known to exist in this poor area: when hard choices must be made in the allocation of resources, boys are more often the beneficiaries. This could be reflected in rescue attempts as much as in the distribution of food and medical attention.

Indirect consequences
In Bangladesh and the eastern region of India, where the arsenic contamination of groundwater is high, flooding intensifies the rate of exposure among rural people and other socioeconomically disadvantaged groups (Khan et al., 2003). Studies have also found a negative correlation between symptoms of arsenic poisoning and specific socioeconomic factors, in particular educational and nutritional status (Mitra et al., 2004; Rehman et al., 2006; Maharajan et al., 2007). Health problems resulting from arsenic poisoning include skin lesions, hardening of the skin, dark spots on the hands and feet, swollen limbs and loss of sensation in the hands and legs (UNICEF, 2008).

 In the south-west region of Bangladesh, waterlogging (local increases in groundwater levels) has emerged as a pressing concern with health consequences. Women are often the primary caregivers of the family, shouldering the burden of managing and cooking food, collecting drinking water, and taking care of family members and livestock. Because of these responsibilities, women often spend time in waterlogged premises and other settings. Research reveals that waterlogging severely affects the health of women in affected communities. Women are forced to stay close to the community and drink unhygienic water, as tube wells frequently become polluted. Pregnant women have difficulty with mobility in marooned and slippery conditions and thus are often forced to stay indoors. Local health-care workers have reported that there are increasing trends of gynaecological problems due to unhygienic water use. Since men are often out of the area in search of work, they are frequently not as severely affected as their female counterparts. Waterlogging, therefore, has given rise to differential health effects in women and men in coastal Bangladesh (Neelormi et al., 2009).
 Socially constructed roles also influence the individual disaster responses of men. Within Latino cultures, for instance, expectations of male “heroism” require men to act courageously, thus forcing them into risky behaviour patterns in the face of danger and making them more likely to die in an extreme event. In contrast, womens relative lack of decision-making power may pose a serious danger itself, especially when it keeps them from leaving their homes in spite of rising water levels, waiting for a male authority to grant them permission or to assist them in leaving (Bradshaw, 2010).
 Girls and women may experience decreased access to important life skills due to gender norms or expectations around behaviours deemed “appropriate”. For example, in some Latin American and Asian countries, women and girls are often not taught to swim, for reasons of modesty (Aguilar, 2004). In the South Asian context, social norms that regulate appropriate dress codes in accordance with notions of modesty may hinder women and girls from learning to swim, which can severely reduce their chances of survival in flooding disasters (Oxfam, 2005).
 Possible health consequences of hazards associated with flooding and typhoons include stress- related illness and risk of malnutrition related to loss of income and subsistence, which are known to have a strong gender dimension (FAO, 2001, 2002; Cannon, 2002). Studies from Viet Nam found that stress factors were apparent at the household level. People interviewed in cities in the Mekong Delta referred to increased anxiety, fears or intra-household tension as a result of the dangers and damage associated with flooding and its livelihood impacts. Interviewees in the central provinces referred to food shortages and hunger potentially resulting from crop and income losses following destructive floods and typhoons (Few & Tran, 2010).
 In flooded areas of Bangladesh, women are often the last people to receive assistance, as some men push them out of the way in the rush for supplies. Women who have lost clothing in the flood are unable to enter public areas to access aid because they can not cover themselves sufficiently (Skutsch, 2004). A further example of this is the loss of culturally appropriate clothing, which inhibits women from leaving temporary shelters to seek medical care or obtain essential resources (Neumayer & Plümper, 2007).

2.1.4 Drought
Direct consequences
Globally, fresh water resources are distributed unevenly, and areas of most severe physical water scarcity are those with the highest population densities. The health impacts of drought and their gender dimensions may be exacerbated further by climate change. Shifting rainfall patterns, increased rates of evaporation and melting of glaciers, and population and economic growth are expected to increase the number of people living in water-stressed water basins from about 1.5 billion in 1990 to 3-6 billion by 2050 (Arnell, 2004). Almost 90% of the burden of diarrhoeal disease is attributable to lack of access to safe water and sanitation (Prüss-Üstün et al., 2008; WHO, 2009a); reduction in the availability and reliability of fresh water supplies is expected to amplify this hazard.
In arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, drought already presents a serious threat to the well-being and health of the local populations. Extended periods of drought are linked not only to water shortages and food insecurity but also to increased risk of fires, decreased availability of fuel, conflicts, migration, limited access to health care and increased poverty. Few studies are available on the consequences of droughts for human health, but all of them point to differing impacts on men and women.
In times of water scarcity women have little choice but to carry water home from unsafe sources, including streams and ponds that are likely to be contaminated. This can lead to water-related diseases such as diarrhoeal disease, which in developing countries is a leading cause of death among children under 5 years of age (WHO & UNICEF, 2005). Moreover, when water is scarce, hygienic practices are commonly sacrificed to more pressing needs for water, such as drinking and cooking. The lack of hygiene can be followed by diseases such as trachoma and scabies, also referred to as “water-washed diseases” (WaterAid, 2007). Almost half of all urban residents in Africa, Asia and Latin America are already victims of diseases associated with poor water and sanitation facilities (WHO & UNICEF, 2006).
Indirect consequences
Droughts and drying can lead to social instability, food insecurity and long-term health problems and can damage or destroy related livelihoods (Pachauri & Reisinger, 2007).
In most developing countries, women are intrinsically tied to water. They are responsible for collecting, storing, protecting and distributing water. For women, long journeys walking to the nearest wells and carrying heavy pots of water not only causes exhaustion and damage to bones but also is accompanied by opportunity costs, such as time that could be spent productively going to school or working.
A study on drought management in Ninh Thuan, Viet Nam showed that 64% of respondents agreed that recurring disasters have differential impacts on women and men, and 74% of respondents believed that women were more severely affected than men by drought, due to differing needs for water. Women collect water from sources that are increasingly further away as each drought takes its toll. With fewer water sources nearby, women often walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Women also cook, clean, rear children and collect firewood, so they cope with enormous physical burdens on a daily basis (Oxfam, 2006).

 Women and girls fetch water in pots, buckets and more modern narrow-necked containers, which are carried on the head or the hip. A family of five people needs approximately 100 litres of water, weighing 100 kg, each day to meet its minimum needs. Women and children may need to walk to the water source two or three times each day. The first of these trips often takes place before dawn, which involves sacrificing sleeping hours, which can pose a serious strain on health. During the dry season in rural India and Africa, 30% or more of a woman's daily energy intake is spent fetching water. Carrying heavy loads over long periods of time causes cumulative damage to the spine, the neck muscles and the lower back, thus leading to early ageing of the vertebral column (Mehretu & Mutambirwa, 1992; Dasgupta, 1993; Page, 1996; Seaforth, 2001; Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, 2005; Ray, 2007). More research is needed to uncover the negative health implications of the burden of daily carrying of water, as it seems to fall outside of the conventional categories of waterborne, water-washed and water-related ailmentsDrought increases the family’s physiological need for water and also results in greater distances travelled to the water source. According to available data, the quantity of collected water per capita is reduced drastically if the walk to a water source takes 30 minutes or longer (WHO & UNICEF, 2005). As a result, the quantity of collected water often does not even cover the basic human physiological requirements. This puts women in a very difficult position, as in many societies women are socially responsible for the family’s water supply. According to a study on water needs and women’s health in Ghana, women who maintain traditional norms are particularly vulnerable during water scarcity, as they often give priority to their husbands, ensuring that the man’s water needs are met before their own (Buor, 2003).
 The stresses of lost incomes and associated indebtedness can spill over into mental health problems, despair and suicide among men. There is some empirical evidence linking drought and suicide among men in Australia (Nicholls et al., 2006). This negative health outcome among Australian rural farmers has been linked to stoicism and poor health-seeking behaviour, which is an intrinsic element of rural masculinity (Alston & Kent, 2008; Alston, 2010). In India, there has been consistent reporting of increased suicide among poor male farmers following periods of droughts in contiguous semi-arid regions (Behere & Behere, 2008; Nagaraj, 2008).

3. Impacts: social and human consequences of climate change
3.1 Migration and displacement
Climate change can affect migration (Box 5) in three distinct ways. First, the effects of warming and drying in some regions will reduce agricultural potential and undermine ‘ecosystem services” such as clean water and fertile soil. Second, the increase in extreme weather events - in particular, heavy precipitation and resulting flash or river floods in tropical regions - will affect ever more people and may generate mass displacement. Finally, sea-level rises are expected to destroy extensive and highly productive low-lying coastal areas that are home to millions of people, who will have to relocate permanently. In this context, health challenges can involve, among other things, the spread of communicable diseases and an increase in the prevalence of psychosocial problems due to stress associated with migration. The human and social consequences of climate change in this context are studied very poorly, if at all.
Box 5: Definition of environmental migrants used in the context of this document
“Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, for compelling reasons of sudden or progressive changes in the environment that adversely affect their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad”.
Source: International Organization for Migration (2007).
There are few studies on the linkages between extreme events and domestic and sexual violence. However, a report that looked into the issue of recovery after the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 indicated that women and children were very vulnerable in these situations. Although the occurrence of tsunamis is not attributable to weather or climate change, one can assume that in the aftermath of extreme events and the ensuing displacement of groups of people that may occur, scenarios similar to the post-tsunami conditions are plausible.
The World Disaster Report recognizes the widespread consensus that “women and girls are at higher risk of sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, trafficking, and domestic violence in disasters” (IFRC, 2007). Women who were subjected to violence before a disaster are more likely to experience increased violence after the disaster, or they may become separated from family, friends and other potential support and protective systems. After a natural disaster, women are more likely to become victims of domestic and sexual violence and may avoid using shelters as a result of fear (Davis et al., 2005; IFRC, 2007).
Psychological stress is likely to be heightened after disasters, particularly where families are displaced and have to live in emergency or transitional housing. Overcrowding, lack of privacy and the collapse of regular routines and livelihood patterns can contribute to anger, frustration and violence, with children and women most vulnerable (Bartlett, 2008).

 Adolescent girls report especially high levels of sexual harassment and abuse in the aftermath of disasters and complain of the lack of privacy in emergency shelters (Bartlett, 2008).
 3.2 Shifts in farming and land use
 For farmers, insecurity due to erratic rainfall and unseasonal temperatures can be compounded by a comparative lack of assets and arable land, and in some cases lack of rights to own the land they till. This means that credit available for suitable agriculture technology (e.g. watering implements, climate appropriate seed varieties, non-petroleum fertilizers, energy-efficient building design) is limited, as is their capacity to rebuild post-natural hazards in this context.
 Loss of biodiversity can compound insecurity because many rural women in different parts of world depend on non-timber forest products for income, traditional medicinal use, nutritional supplements in times of food shortages, and a seed bank for plant varieties needed to source alternative crops under changing growing conditions. Thus, loss of biodiversity challenges the nutrition, health and livelihood of women and their communities (Boffa, 1999; Pisupati & Warner, 2003, Roe et al., 2006; Arnold, 2008).
 Nutritional status partly determines the ability to cope with the effect of natural disasters (Cannon, 2002). Women are more prone to nutritional deficiencies because of their unique nutritional needs, especially when they are pregnant or breastfeeding, and some cultures have household food hierarchies. For example, in South Asia and South-East Asia, 45-60% of women of reproductive age are underweight and 80% of pregnant women have iron deficiencies. In sub- Saharan Africa, women carry greater loads than men but have a lower intake of calories because the cultural norm is for men to receive more food (FAO, 2001). For girls and women, poor nutritional status is associated with an increased prevalence of anaemia, pregnancy and delivery problems, and increased rates of intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight and perinatal mortality. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in places where iron deficiency is prevalent, the risk of women dying during childbirth can be increased by as much as 20% (FAO, 2002).
 Pregnant and lactating women face additional challenges, as they have an increased need for food and water, and their mobility is limited. Globally, at any given time, an average of 18-20% of the reproductive age population is either pregnant or lactating (Rohr, 2007). These biological factors create a highly vulnerable population within a group that is already at risk (Shrade & Delaney, 2000).
 3.3 Increased livelihood, household and caring burdens
 Apart from the nutritional impacts of livelihood, household and caring burdens, decline in food security and livelihood opportunities can also cause considerable stress for men and boys, given the socially ascribed expectation that they should provide economically for the household. This can lead to mental illness in some cases. It has been recognized that men and boys are less likely than women and girls to seek help for stress and mental health issues (Masika, 2002).
 Women and girls are generally expected to care for the sick, including in times of disaster and environmental stress (Brody et al., 2008). This limits the time they have available for income generation and education, which, when coupled with the rising medical costs associated with family illness, heightens levels of poverty, which is in turn a powerful determinant of health. It also means they have less time to contribute to community-level decision-making processes, including on climate change and disaster risk reduction. In addition, being faced with the burden of caring for dependents while being obliged to travel further for water and firewood makes women and girls prone to stress-related illnesses and exhaustion (CIDA, 2002; VSO, 2006).
Women and girls may also face barriers to accessing health-care services due to poor control over economic and other assets to avail themselves of health care, and cultural restrictions on their mobility that may prohibit them from travelling to seek health care.
Increased time spent collecting water means a decrease in available time for education and places women and girls at risk of violence when travelling long distances. A lower education status implies more constraints for women to access health information or early warning systems as they are developed. This also means that girls and women have decreased access and opportunities in the labour market, increased health risks associated with pregnancy and childbirth, and less control over their personal lives.
Elderly women may have heavy family and caring responsibilities that cause stress and fatigue, while also preventing wider social and economic participation. Their incomes may be low because they can no longer take on paid work or other forms of income generation. They may have inadequate understanding of their rights to access community and private-sector services. Even when they are aware of these services, nominal financial resources for clinic visits and drugs may be out of their reach. Access is further restricted for older women and older men living in rural areas, who are often unable to travel the long distances to the nearest health facility.
Older men are particularly disadvantaged by their tendency to be less connected than women to social networks and therefore unable to seek assistance from within the community when they need it (Consedine & Skamai, 2009).
3.4 Urban health
An individuals place of residence and their status within that place are important determinants of health. Urbanization is a dominant trend, with more people living in marginal conditions in cities in developing countries. Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities to climate related health hazards (Campbell-Lendrum & Corvalan, 2007).
Limited access to land in rural areas, conflict, divorce and unemployment forces increasing numbers of women into living in marginalized urban and peri-urban areas and slums. These dwellings are often situated on ground with particular environmental risks, such as hillsides and low-lying plots.
The rising rate of female-headed households in urban/peri-urban areas results in a shift of urban sex ratios and feminization of urban poverty. Poverty, exposure of dwelling, and managing on their own the disproportionate daily burden of infrastructural needs such as waste management, fuel, water and sanitation make urban female heads of households particularly vulnerable to natural disasters (Chant, 2007).

4. Responses to climate change
 “Climate change will affect, in profoundly adverse ways, some of the most fundamental determinants of health: food, air, water.”3
 “Climate change could vastly increase the current huge imbalance in health outcomes. Climate change can worsen an already unacceptable situation that the Millennium Development Goals were explicitly and intricately designed to address.”
 The international response to climate change is governed by the UNFCCC. The stated aim of the UNFCCC is to avoid the “adverse effects” of climate change, which it defines not only as impacts on “natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of socio-economic systems” but also on “human health and welfare” (UN, 1992). Although climate change is widely considered to be one of the most significant threats to future human development, it is often analysed through an exclusively environmental or economic perspective, without adequately considering the extent to which it affects all aspects of human societies.
 According to Article 4T. of the UNFCCC, before parties propose new adaptation or mitigation initiatives, they shall assess its health benefits or negative impacts together with environmental and economic considerations. This article recognizes the importance of considering health and other social implications, including gender equality, when developing impact assessments and not basing decisions only on potential economic and environmental impacts. The correct implementation of this UNFCCC provision will bring opportunities to advance the sustainable development agenda.
 In contrast, poorly designed policies could easily undermine gender equality, climate and health equity goals and reduce public support for their implementation. An essential aspect for achieving health equity and climate goals is therefore a commitment to intersectoral action to achieve “health equity and climate change in all policies” (Walpole et al., 2009).
 Specific policies need to be carefully designed and assessed. Integrated assessment methods that consider the gendered range of effects on health and health equity can maximize synergies and optimize trade-offs between competing priorities. At the design stage, implementing safeguards and flanking measures, such as recycling revenue from carbon pricing measures, towards health outcomes for disadvantaged groups can help avoid or reduce inequitable effects (Walpole et al., 2009).
 4.1 Mitigation actions and health co-benefits
 The UNFCCC states that mitigation measures bringing about societal benefits should be prioritized. Health is one of the clearest of the societal benefits. Measures undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the household energy, transport, food and agriculture, and electricity generation sectors, in both low- and high-income settings, can have ancillary health benefits (or “health co-benefits”), which are often substantial.

There is growing interest in the links between gender and mitigation efforts. To develop effective mitigation policies and programmes that will also impact on key health outcomes, it is crucial that equity and gender perspectives are integrated into relevant policy and programme design.
There is accumulating evidence of important differences in the circumstances, attitudes and behaviours of women and men in relation to decisions on mitigation policies and their relation to health. For example, a study that looked at gender differences in energy consumption patterns and greenhouse gas emissions among single households in Greece, Sweden, Norway and Germany found that the average single man consumed more energy than the average single woman in all four countries studied. The largest difference in absolute energy use between single men and single women was in the category of transport (primarily due to cars). In the study the average single man spent more money on vehicles and fuel than did the average single woman. Men also spent more money on buying cars and other vehicles than did women, resulting in higher indirect energy use by men. Women on the other hand consistently used more energy than men in consumption categories such as food, hygiene, household effects and health, although the differences were small (Ràty & Carlsson-Kanyama, 2010). Studies for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have shown that women make over 80% of consumer decisions and are more likely to be sustainable consumers, with a higher propensity to recycle and placing a higher value on efficient energy compared with men (OECD, 2008). Such differences are likely to be particularly important in relation to choices such as food, because decisions such as moderating meat and dairy consumption can help to reduce the large contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time bring very large health benefits.
Gender differences extend beyond individual consumer choices and also apply to attitudes to wider policy decisions. For example, a large survey in Australia examined attitudes towards carbon capture and storage from power plants and other stationary sources (IPCC & TEAP, 2005), which has been advocated as a potential measure to reduce greenhouse gases but which also raises environmental, health and safety concerns related to possible leakage of carbon dioxide. The survey showed women were less accepting of carbon capture and storage and more concerned than men about safety, risk and effectiveness (Miller et al., 2007).
When devising and applying policy instruments for energy efficiency or emission reductions, it is important to know the target groups. If women and men differ regarding their use of energy and emission profiles, then the mitigation policy instruments should reflect these differences to achieve the maximum benefits from the policies (Miller et al., 2007). The integration of a gender analysis component will help in understanding how gender norms, roles and relations determine the different patterns of obtaining and using fuel, energy and water by both women and men. The following sections examine these interactions for two of the sectors that make the largest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and health outcomes, and that have the strongest evidence of gender-specific differences.
4.1.1 Access to energy
One of the main responsibilities of women in developing countries is ensuring energy supply and security at the household level. It is therefore crucial to involve women in the design, negotiation and implementation of clean energy choices that have the potential to improve health and wellbeing, both through reduced risks to health, and through savings in time and financial resources

 (Aguilar, 2009). In addition, involving men is also important because they are often the decision-makers in households in many parts of the world. Involving both women and men will increase the chances of adoption and sustenance of alternative energy strategies. There is also a need to address existing, often unequal power relations regarding decision-making on household security and energy consumption through empowerment of women.
 Lessening the reliance on coal-fired generation of power will reduce air pollution and associated respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and death (von Hilderbrand, 2009). Indeed, the provision of affordable clean household energy in developing countries can contribute to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals through both co-benefits to health and contributions to poverty reduction - attained by the provision of productive work and the reduction of unproductive time. This in turn can lead to a reduction of gender inequities (Wilkinson et al., 2007).
 Approximately 2 billion people lack access to electricity and suffer substantial ill-health as a result. Around half the global population cooks daily with traditional biomass fuels (e.g. dung, crop residues, wood, charcoal), resulting (particularly for women and children) in exposure to very high concentrations of indoor air pollutants and impacting on health by increasing the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, worsening lung function (Behera et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2007), and contributing to childhood pneumonia and lung cancer. In addition, fuel shortages increase the workload of women in places where they are responsible for collecting fuel.
 More energy-efficient cooking stoves are becoming increasingly available in a number of countries and can substantially cut the use of biomass fuels, with subsequent health, environmental and economic benefits (Haines et al., 2006) (for an example, see Box 6).
Box 6: The Nepal Biogas Support Programme
Inefficient burning of biomass in unventilated homes releases high levels of black carbon, causing approximately 2 million deaths a year, mainly among women and children in the poorest populations. The black carbon from such burning is also a significant contributor to local and regional warming. Improved access to clean energy therefore presents opportunities for improving health, livelihoods and the environment.
Biogas systems convert cattle dung and other animal or human wastes into methane. This flammable gas is a simple-to-use fuel for lighting and cooking: it burns cleanly and efficiently on a conventional low-pressure gas burner. In Nepal, the Biogas Support Programme has installed more than 120 000 biogas plants over the past 13 years. About 3% of Nepalese homes now benefit from this intervention, with much lower levels of indoor air pollution and reduced time spent gathering fuel, with particular gains for women. Moreover, 72% of the biogas plants are connected to latrines, leading to improved cleanliness and reduced health risks in the vicinity of the home. The residual slurry is a valuable organic fertilizer.
This biogas programme was the first to be recognized under the Clean Development Mechanism. It trades certified emission reductions; each operational biogas plant is worth 4.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide (C02) equivalent per year. This success story points to new synergies between household energy programmes and efforts to reduce climate change.

Although hydroelectric power is a clean and renewable energy source and attractive as a mitigation strategy to reduce greenhouse gases, hydropower plants can significantly impact on the surrounding area and provoke opposition for numerous social, environmental, economic and safety reasons. It is estimated that the construction of hydropower plants has already displaced some 30-60 million people/ usually poor people who are further impoverished economically and suffer cultural decline, high rates of sickness and death, and great psychological stress. As the majority of impoverished people are women, and women also suffer specific health consequences of forced migration, it is expected that such displacement would have a gender dimension (Davis et al., 2005; IFRC, 2007; Bartlett, 2008). The livelihoods of people downstream of dams can also be severely affected through the destruction of fisheries, the contamination of water supplies and the loss of seasonal floods, which bring fertile silt and water to agricultural land. Dam reservoirs can also become breeding grounds for water-related diseases such as malaria and schistosomiasis (Diop & Jobin, 1994; Ghebreyesus et al., 1999).
Sources of renewable energy such as photovoltaic, solar, thermal, wave and wind power do not appear to have any important adverse effects on health, and their overall impacts are likely to be overwhelmingly beneficial (Haines & Kammen, 2000).
4.1.2 Transportation
Transport is currently responsible for about 23% of world energy-related greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2007a). Transport is projected to create the fastest proportional growth in greenhouse gas emissions of any sector from 1990 to 2020, with direct connections with urban air pollution (around 1.3 million related lung cancer deaths per year globally), road traffic accidents (the first leading cause of death in 2004 in men aged 15-44 years, over 1.2 million deaths per year, and 20-50 million non-fatal injuries per year) and physical inactivity (more than 3.2 million deaths in 2004) (WHO, 2009a,b). The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is prompting consideration of a more sustainable focus where the emphasis is on public transport, active transport and road safety. The gender dimensions need to be studied further.
In 2002, males accounted for 73% of all road traffic deaths, with an overall rate almost three times that for females (27.6 males per 100 000 population; 10.4 females per 100 000 population). Road traffic mortality rates are higher in men than in women in all regions, regardless of income level, and also are higher across all age groups. The gender difference in mortality rates is probably related to both exposure and risk-taking behaviour (Waldron et al., 2005).
Despite traditional engineering approaches favouring high-cost infrastructure that provides greater speed for vehicles, it has been shown that measures that truly improve urban transport overall are those that reduce speeds and provide a safer environment for pedestrians (Broaddus et al., 2009). Speed-reduction policies have big environmental impacts and also result in great public health benefits: for every 1 km/h reduction in average speed, there is a 3% reduction in the incidence of injury-incurring car crashes (WHO, 2004). For example, in Israel, major highway projects are usually based on cost-benefit analyses in which the value of time saved on car travel, especially travel to work, is weighted heavily. Yet highway development, which also encourages suburbanization and fragmentation of commercial and residential functions and degrades public transport, leads to a loss rather than a saving of women's time (Fletcher et al., 1999).
V See http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/node/570.
 Promoting active transport such as cycling and walking by providing cycling lanes, pedestrian paths and pedestrian precincts could result in very large public health benefits. It is well known that physical activity is a protective factor for a wide range of diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, dementia and some types of cancer. An urban environment that encourages active transport and lifestyle overall would bring social and mental health benefits and potentially lower obesity rates (Woodcock et al., 2009). The extent to which active transport can be integrated into everyday life depends on the distances to be travelled, the available infrastructure and resources, and the respective cultural and social norms of a country. Cultural restrictions on the mobility of women can make them resort to other means of transport.
 In some parts of Africa, women who ride bicycles are highly stigmatized, and cultural constraints may not permit a woman to ride a bicycle or a scooter. This cultural norm inhibits women's range of mobility and makes them more dependent on their male counterparts, thereby hindering appropriate health-seeking.
 Further restrictions on women include gender-based issues around vehicle ownership. Men are typically the first to get access to a private vehicle in a household and, when possible, also the first to motorize. Furthermore, men are more likely to get a driving licence. Women on the contrary usually use the vehicle that is left behind and often rely on public transport for travelling longer distances (GTZ & Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, 2007). A study on road transport, environment and social equity conducted in Israel in 1999 found that gender roles dictated different travel patterns for women and men. Israeli women made more short journeys and fewer interurban trips than men - a factor probably related to their multiple roles in the workplace and home. In metropolitan Tel-Aviv-Jafo, women made about 50% more trips daily in their community of residence compared with men. Conversely, men made about 60% more interurban car trips compared with women. The special needs of women in relation to short-distance travel networks - including pedestrian and urban mass transit routes - receive little attention from policy-makers, who focus largely on the planning of improved interurban and urban bypass roads (Garb & Fletcher, 1999).
 A study that examined transportation improvement strategies for a major urban highway corridor in Dhaka, Bangladesh examined the impacts of different road-improvement strategies on transit passengers and rickshaw pullers. The primary focus of the road-improvement strategy was to reduce congestion by restricting non-motorized transport modes such as rickshaws, which were a major part of the travel flow in the corridor. Many of those interviewed stated that although congestion on the major road declined, the road-improvement strategies had a negative impact on women, especially those in low- and middle-income groups, who find it extremely difficult to ride in overcrowded local buses during peak hours (Salma, 2004).
 These examples demonstrate that gender is a key component for planning, designing and implementing transportation policies. An example from Bogotá, Colombia (Box 7) illustrates that the implementation of sustainable transportation policies does not only impact on the immediate environment but also can have an effect on gender equality, health and quality of life.
Box 7: Sustainable transport in Bogotávl
Until recently, Bogotá’s growth has placed a strain on its roads and public areas. Due to inadequate urban and transportation planning, Bogotá’s streets were congested and polluted, and public urban spaces, including parks, open spaces and pedestrian paths, were disappearing in favour of uncontrolled urban sprawl. This hostile environment provided a fertile ground for social and economic inequality and environmental degradation in the city, and contributed to the city’s urban decay.
As Bogotá’s urban population passed 6 million, there was increasing awareness that local and national policy-makers would need to work jointly to provide effective solutions. The implementation of a planned and sustained policy resulted in an urban renewal campaign over a period of 12 years. This included changes in planning methods, effective public and private management, and a new focus on public participation, with the aim of generating an inclusive, sustainable and just city, transformed from a city for cars into a city for its people.
The mass transport system TransMNenio is considered a cornerstone in this model of urban development. TransMilenio uses a large fleet of high-capacity buses operating in dedicated arterial lanes (84 km of arterial lanes and 512 km of feeder route lanes) offering coverage and accessibility to 536 neighbourhoods, mainly benefiting low-income populations living in the peripheries of the city. The system has an average of 1.66 million daily transit trips and accounts for 26% of all public transportation trips in Bogotá. The TransMilenio buses also include reserved seating, spaces for wheelchairs and pushchairs, and preferential entry doors for pregnant women, people with disabilities, children and older people.
The overall renewal campaign also included infrastructural improvements such as building and renovating cycle paths (354 km) and footpaths, outlawing cars from using the footpaths, closing several streets to cars to convert them into pedestrian areas, creating and renewing green spaces and parks, and improving public facilities.
Data from TransMilenio and the ITSD indicate large and rapid benefits. Using 1998 base year data, the system is estimated to have saved up to 40 minutes per trip, and traffic accidents have been reduced by approximately 50% in the corridors where TransMilenio operates, with a reduction in injuries of more than 80%. There has been a reduction of 3-10 decibels in noise levels in the main arterial corridors. From its inception in 2001 until 2008, the project reduced C02 emissions by over 1.6 million tons. Particulate matter and nitrogen and sulphur oxides decreased by over 60 000 tons, generating significant health benefits and creating health-care savings estimated at over US$ 428 million between 2006 and 2009. The crime rate also dropped notably over the same period.
The project is considered to have contributed to the social development of the city. TransMilenio is estimated to have generated almost 40 thousand direct jobs (supported by social security and health benefits, and welfare, epidemiological monitoring and disease-prevention programmes) and over 55 thousand indirect jobs. The system has also aimed at balancing the traditional dominance of men in the transport workforce, and prioritized the employment of groups such as single mothers, who comprise 62% of the female workforce. The female participation is currently 24% of the total system workforce, ranging from 2-8% in jobs such as bus driving, to 43% in bus washing, to 70% in fare collection.
This initiative is widely considered to have brought large improvements in health, gender equity and environmental sustainability to the people of Bogotá, and it is internationally recognized as an example for urban renewal.

 Providing opportunities for the use of safe mass transport can reduce levels of ambient air pollution and traffic-related injuries and deaths (von Hilderbrand, 2009).
 4.2 Adaptation actions
 Adaptation refers to changes in “processes, practices, or structures to moderate or offset potential damages or to take advantage of opportunities associated with changes in climate” and involves adjustments to decrease the vulnerability of communities and regions to the impacts of climate change and variability (IPCC, 2001b). Whereas adaptation was initially considered as a secondary and long-term option if mitigation efforts were not successful, it is now clear that some degree of adaptation is already necessary, particularly in developing countries (UNDP & GGCA, 2009). At the same time, there has been an expansion of approaches to adaptation, from an initial focus on interventions and infrastructure, to a more “development oriented” approach which aims to tackle the underlying drivers of vulnerability, rather than responding only to the symptoms (World Bank, no date).
 This kind of second-generation approach helps to build resilience (Box 8) not only to climate change but also to other stressors that affect health and well-being, such as weaknesses in health care, education, social safety nets, and gender equity (World Bank, no date).
Box 8: Resilience to climate change (adaptive capacity)
When referring to human systems, the term “resilience” can be considered a synonym of adaptive capacity (IPCC, 2001b).
Adaptive capacity is the ability of a human or natural system to adapt - that is, to adjust to climate change, including to climate variability and extremes; to prevent or moderate potential damages; to take advantage of opportunities; or to cope with the consequences. The adaptive capacity inherent in a human system represents the set of resources available for adaptation (information, technology, economic resources, institutions and so on) and the ability or capacity of that system to use the resources effectively in pursuit of adaptation.
Source: World Bank (2010).
 The following sections describe gender dimensions related to key components of adaptive capacity: coping strategies and local early warning systems.
 4.2.1 Coping strategies
 Adaptation measures in urban areas can reduce “heat island” effects, improve opportunities for social interaction and physical activity, and increase resilience to flooding. Similarly, improved building standards can reduce energy consumption, provide greater resilience to extreme weather, and reduce opportunities for infectious disease transmission (Campbell-Lendrum & Corvalan, 2007; Bloomberg & Aggarwala, 2008).
 Although women and men can be powerful contributors of change in coping with changing climate conditions, the role of women is undervalued or undermined in many societies. There is a need for women to be fully integrated into climate change adaptation strategies at all levels (Costello et al., 2009).
Case studies in Bangladesh, Ghana and Senegal have highlighted grassroots womens groups developing strategies to cope with issues related to energy and forestry, agriculture, water resources and trade.
FAO, in collaboration with local Indian institutions, conducted a survey on gender responses in coping with variability and long-term changes in climate. According to this survey, men are more likely to report that the weather changes have impacted farm production, while women are more likely to report that such changes have affected health. The study also explored differences in the preferred strategies for coping with long-term weather shifts. The preference to migrate was higher in men (47% of men versus 18% of women), whereas more women would opt to go for wage labour (57.5% of women versus 38% of men). Gender differences were also detected in access to vital information on weather alerts and cropping patterns. According to the farmers reports, only 21% of women have access to this information, compared with 47% of men. These findings illustrate that gender is a cornerstone in dealing with adaptation strategies of climate change. Gender differences in access to resources and in selecting coping strategies have to be well understood and addressed because they matter both to farmers in their everyday experience of climate variability and to policy-makers in order to provide institutional support and the enabling environment (FAO, 2009).
In Nepal “mountain women” compared to women in the lowlands, and depending on the dominant culture within which they live, have a greater say in decision-making and have greater overall independence. The constant migrations of men mean that these women must be more involved in managing household and community resources. The women are able to maximize use of their available natural resources. Their knowledge helps in the survival and care of their families and permits adaptation in extreme situations such as conflicts, natural disasters and displacements. Unfortunately, their knowledge and skills are still not acknowledged and valued (WEDO, 1998). Box 9 shows another example of empowerment of rural women.

Box 9: Good practices: Bolivia - democratizing knowledge for rural empowerment
The Bolivian high-altitude plains are a harsh, arid, cold climate for agriculture, and innovative methods are needed for survival. An initiative started in October 2006 and concluded in July 2008, supported by Intercooperation, aimed to use traditional knowledge of climate prediction for better decision-making in agricultural production and risk management. This has helped to strengthen the capabilities in disaster risk management, monitoring bio-indicators of climate and weather-related hazards.
The programme was gender-sensitive, and the inclusion of women’s expertise in the initiative was vital for transferring agricultural success into stable livelihoods, through women’s traditional skills and roles in crop and seed storage, and in accessing markets. Women had the knowledge to design strategies for risk management and were able to assist other women farmers. They not only transferred knowledge but also helped to build up analytical capabilities of farming women.
The following lessons were learned from this experience: Agricultural risk management is a task for both women and men in rural contexts and empowerment can be achieved for women if they are recognized as knowledge managers.
The result is that farmers now lose less food because of climate threats. Also men and women are now capable of defeating frosts in the altiplano. In 2 years, more than 100 sound technologies and good practices were developed or reintroduced from traditional knowledge.

 4.2.2 Early warning systems and hazard management
 Case studies related to gender and natural disaster showed that women make an important contribution to disaster reduction, usually informally through participating in disaster management and acting as agents of social change. Women's resilience and women's networks are particularly important in household and community recovery (IPCC, 2007b).
 After the 1999 Orissa cyclone, most of the relief efforts were targeted at or through women, giving them control over resources. Women received relief kits, including housebuilding grants and loans, resulting in improved self-esteem and social status. Similarly, following a disastrous 1992 flood in Pakistan in the Sarghoda district, women were involved in the reconstruction design and were given joint ownership of their homes, promoting their empowerment (Confalonieri et al., 2007).
 After Hurricane Mitch in 1998, La Masica, Honduras surprisingly reported no deaths (Box 10). A disaster agency had provided gender-sensitive community education on early warning systems and hazard management 6 months earlier. Women were able to assume responsibility for continuously monitoring the early warning system, a role traditionally performed by men. As a result, the municipality was able to evacuate the area promptly when Hurricane Mitch struck (Buvinic et al., 1999).

Box 10: La Masica: Good practices in emergency preparedness
The municipality of La Masica in Honduras, with a mostly rural population of 336 people, stands out in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch because, unlike other municipalities in the northern Atlantida Department, it reported no deaths. This outcome can be directly attributed to a process of community emergency preparedness that began about 6 months before the disaster.
The project involved the establishment of networks of local organizations in charge of risk and disaster management, coordinated through the municipality and the Municipal Emergency Commission. Networks were trained in the geographical mapping of hazards and use of an early warning system, and undertook an assessment of vulnerabilities differentiated by gender. Gender lectures were given and, consequently, the community decided that men and women should participate equally in all hazard management activities. When Hurricane Mitch struck, the municipality was prepared and evacuated the area promptly, thus avoiding deaths. Women participated actively in all relief operations. They went on rescue missions, rehabilitated local infrastructure such as schools, and, along with men, distributed food. Women also took over from men who had abandoned the task of continuous monitoring of the early warning system.
This experience shows that preparedness is an important step in saving lives. The engagement of women from the start, on an equal footing with men, contributed to the success in saving lives. In addition, and likely because of their active role, women reported a very low incidence of depression. In fact, contrary to repeated findings in the literature on disasters, the community assessed the psychological situation and concluded that help was required for men rather than for women to restore their capacity to contribute to the community.
One of the most important gains at La Masica was the empowerment of women and the community’s recognition of women’s capabilities and contributions. As a token of recognition, a new sign in the mayor’s office reads: “Everything is easier with the cooperation of women.”
Source: Buvinic et al. (1999).
Table i summarizes possible gender impacts of climate change and gender adaptive strategies, and provides recommendations for possible policy interventions to safeguard health, especially of women. The table reflects the gaps in data that can strengthen more specific and targeted interventions.


5. Conclusions, gaps in understanding and issues for urgent action
Preparations for, and responses to, climate change need to be sensitive to gender dimensions of health care (including mental) and health-seeking behaviours.
Policies to promote mitigation activities that have strong co-benefits in health and other development needs provide a potential political bridge across the “development gap” between rich and poor countries.
Adaptation strategies need to take into account women's and men's relative and different capacities, power, social resilience, vulnerabilities and resources, because gender norms, roles and relations can either enable or constrain adaptive capacities.
IPCC acknowledges that disasters affect men and women differently on a number of levels, including economically, socially, psychologically, and in terms of exposure to risk and risk perception. However, there remains a general lack of research on sex and gender differences in vulnerability to, and impacts of climate change especially health-related impacts.
Addressing the social and gender dimensions of climate change poses many challenges that are not insurmountable. It requires gender mainstreaming in climate change response activities, sustainable and equitable development, a clear focus on adaptation and mitigation, a strong commitment of resources, and empowerment of individuals to build their own resilience.
Equity and social justice cannot be achieved without recognizing the differences in vulnerability and strengths of women and men, and the various factors that contribute to vulnerability. Recognizing these differences is a necessary and important component of any prospective attempts to address the gendered health consequences of climate change. Gender-sensitive research is needed to better understand the health impacts of climate change in general and extreme events in particular. There is an urgent need to collect, analyse and report relevant data disaggregated by age and sex; and, depending on the context, other stratifiers should be included to enable thorough gender analysis. There is a need for the development of gender-responsive and accessible health services that reach the poorest populations, thereby addressing particular health needs of women and men throughout their entire life-cycle.

Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems
World Health Organization



Introduction
 This document presents the World Health Organization (WHO) Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems. The framework responds to the demand from Member States and partners for guidance on how the health sector and its operational basis in health systems can systematically and effectively address the challenges increasingly presented by climate variability and change. This framework has been designed in light of the increasing evidence of climate change and its associated health risks (1); global, regional and national policy mandates to protect population health (2); and a rapidly emerging body of practical experience in building health resilience to climate change (3).
 Primarily intended for public health professionals and health managers, this framework would also help guide decision-makers in other health-determining sectors, such as nutrition, water and sanitation, and emergency management. International development agencies could use this framework to focus investments and country support for public health, health system strengthening and climate change adaptation.
 The objective of this framework is to provide guidance for health systems and public health programming to increase their capacity for protecting health in an unstable and changing climate. By implementing the 10 key components laid out in this framework, health organizations, authorities and programmes will be better able to anticipate, prevent, prepare for and manage climate-related health risks. Least developed countries and countries in the process of developing the health components of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (4) may find this document particularly useful in their efforts to design a comprehensive response to the risks presented by short-term climate variability and long-term climate change.

Background
2.1 Public health rationale
There is clear evidence that human actions, principally the burning of fossil fuels and associated release of climate pollutants, are causing significant changes in global climate. This in turn is creating observed consequences in environmental and social conditions across all continents (5). As many of the largest health concerns are strongly influenced by weather and climate conditions, this inevitably presents risks for human health that can be grouped into:
Direct impacts, such as those arising from damages and illness due to increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
Environmental system mediated impacts, such as rising air pollution and changing patterns of vector-, food- and water-borne diseases.
Socially mediated effects that occur via effect of climate change on social and human systems, such as health effects resulting from undernutrition, occupational heat stress and mental illness, as well as potential increases in population displacement, slowing of economic growth and poverty aggravation.
Table 1 shows some of the main climate-related health risks, that have been assessed as having medium-to-strong evidence by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In addition, the IPCC identifies a series of key reasons for concern with regard to effects of climate change which are either particularly severe or irreversible (5). This includes the potential: (i) increase in severity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as storms and floods causing mass displacement and disruption of livelihoods in low-lying coastal zones and small island states due to storm surges and rise in sea level; (ii) breakdown of food systems resulting in food shortages and volatile prices, particularly in low- and middle-income countries; (iii) potential increase in risk of violent conflict associated with resource scarcity and population movements; and (iv) slowing down of economic growth and exacerbation of poverty, with associated reversal of global health progress, achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and the objectives of the forthcoming post-2015 development agenda.
Overall, climate change is expected to significantly increase health risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries and populations. They will also disproportionately affect vulnerable groups within each country, including the poor, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Despite these challenges, a lot can be done to protect deterioration of health due to climatic conditions. Over the long term, mitigation is necessary to avoid continued degradation of the environmental determinants of health. In the short-to-medium term (i.e. up to the next 20-30 years) well-planned adaptation measures can avoid much of the projected health impacts.

2 Operational framework for building climate resilient health systems



This operational framework can be used by all health systems, but is particularly oriented to support those in low- and middle-income countries, which often already face challenges to adequately prepare for health emergencies and control disease burdens, provide coverage of basic healthcare and public health services, manage inequity, and use resources in a cost- effective way. Health systems with such challenges are at particularly high risk for future setbacks and losses in health achievements gained. And, in these locations building of resilience would need to start with reducing existing health system vulnerabilities.
2.2 Policy context
The operational framework responds to policy mandates at global, regional and (increasingly at) national levels. It includes the World Health Assembly (WHA) and WHO regional committee resolutions on health protection from climate change, strengthening national health emergency and disaster management capacities for managing the risks of meteorological and other extreme events, health system strengthening and implementation of International Health Regulations (2,7). It also responds to the requests by parties to the UNFCCC regarding provision of support in planning adaptation to climate change in key sectors, including health. Additionally, it responds to the post-2015 development agenda and associated Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction.
This document therefore aims to support national ministries of health and their partners to identify the key functions that need to be strengthened in order to provide a comprehensive public health response to climate change, within an overall intersectoral NAP (4).

 Applying a resilience approach to health systems

3.1 Goal and objectives
Framework goal
The goal is to enhance the capacity of health systems to protect and improve population health in an unstable and changing climate. Ultimately, health systems should be increasingly strengthened and continue to be efficient and responsive to improve health, reduce inequities and vulnerability, and provide adequate social and financial protection, in light of the shocks and stresses they may face from climate variability and change. The framework therefore aims to achieve its goal through activities that build capacity to effectively monitor, anticipate, manage and adapt to the health risks associated with climate variability and change.
Framework objectives
Specifically, this framework aims to:
guide professionals working in health systems, and in health determining sectors (e.g. water and sanitation, food and agriculture, energy, urban planning) to understand and effectively prepare for the additional health risks posed by climate variability and change, through a resilience approach; identify the main health functions that need to be strengthened to build up climate resilience, and use these as the basis for developing a comprehensive and practical plan (e.g. as the health component of NAP (H-NAP)) (4); and support health decision-makers to identify roles and responsibilities to implement this plan, for actors both within and outside the formal health sector.

3.2 Introducing a resilience approach

What is resilience?
IPCC defines ‘resilience’ as the “capacity of a social-ecological system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity, and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. ” (6)

In the simplest terms, resilience refers to the holistic ability and agility of a system to change and flex - according to circumstances - and continue to function under stress, while undergoing change. Resilience is much more than just the absence of vulnerability; it is about whole system capacity.
Adaptations to climate change and climate resilience building are closely related, but not synonymous. Adaptation"" as defined by the IPCC inits Fifth assessment report, is the “process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects” (6),
With regard to health, resilience relates to the capacity of the system itself to cope with and manage health risks in a way that the essential functions, identity and structure of health systems are maintained. While health adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities, the preservation of a certain level of quality and sustainable performance of the system itself is not ensured. The incorporation of a climate-resilient approach to health systems contributes to assuring the performance of the system, and therefore, the sustainability and maximisation of value for money of health investments. However; it is important to remember that maintaining system resilience may not always be possible. The magnitude of climate-induced changes or shocks may be so significant that it is outside human abilities to maintain its essential functions, and thus the system may collapse or faiL


The degree of resilience a system possesses largely manifests in step 4 (choices and opportunities; see Figure 2). Low levels of resilience may result in the system collapsing (health operations cease) or experiencing setbacks (limited health service delivery capacity due to stock losses or staff shortages) that put them in a worse position than before the adverse events.

3.3 Applying a resilience approach to health systems

Building health system resilience to climate change is a cumulative process. It begins with making resilience a goal, in addition to current goals of improving population health, being responsive and efficient and providing social and financial protection.
This entails building capacity to: recognize, monitor, anticipate, communicate and prepare for changing climate-related health risks; prevent, respond to, manage, and cope with uncertainty, adversity and stress; adapt operations to changing risk conditions; recover from crisis and setbacks with minimal outside support; and learn from experience and improve system capacity for the future.
WHO working definition of a climate resilient health system
A climate resilient health system is one that is capable to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate-related shocks and stress, so as to bring sustained improvements in population health, despite an unstable climate.
For the whole health system to become more climate-resilient, its independent building blocks (i.e. leadership and governance, health workforce, health information systems, essential medical products and technologies, service delivery and financing) have to also become climate resilient.
Furthermore, in order to effectively protect the health of the population, the health sector should strengthen and extend its sphere of influence and operations beyond itself mainly in relation to health-determining sectors (e.g. water, energy, food and agriculture and urban planning). While it is clear that the management of these sectors is not directly under the control of the health sector, the development of normative guidance to determine acceptable levels of exposure to risks for health (e.g. water and air quality guidelines) is a core health role. In the same way, the role of monitoring health outcomes in relation to the operations of these sectors is usually the responsibility of the health sector.
Ultimately, the health sector should effectively extend into the community level if the health system is to protect health and facilitate community resilience. Local level dialogue, two- way information exchange, and community mobilization should be considered essential functions of the health system. Community empowerment can activate local capacity, increase the scope of available information, improve understanding of vulnerability and build foundations for local resilience.

3.4 Overarching considerations in building resilience
Building climate resilience is a process of teaching the health system to more effectively adapt to change, particularly changing health risks due to climate change. The process of building resilience occurs in two principle ways: (i) reducing overall vulnerability, and (ii) developing specific system capacities. Incorporating these considerations when applying the operational framework is important to integrating climate perspectives to health policy and operations.
Reduce vulnerability
A healthier population and stronger health system will be more resilient to climate change. In order to reduce vulnerability and create resilient health systems and healthier populations that are able to respond to potential health effects from climate change, the following measures are recommended:
• Continued investments to reduce poverty and inequity.
Universal access to essential services, such as health, education, clean water and adequate food.
For health system strengthening the following measures are recommended:
An adequate workforce and climate-proofed infrastructure in local facilities to control climate-sensitive diseases and improve response to local emergencies.
Surveillance systems to monitor population health and environmental exposure.
• Good practices of health governance.
Develop capacities
Addressing current gaps and improving the current health system or programme performance is not enough to prepare a health system to tackle climate change. Health systems should increasingly take steps to understand how climate change will affect their population and service delivery, evaluate the effectiveness of their interventions and systems under diverse climatic conditions, and enhance their institutional capacity accordingly. To do this, public health and health system capacities that are attuned to climate realities are needed.
Add long-term perspectives for actions to be put in place today
Climate related health risks occur at multiple timescales, from short-term climate variability (such as heat waves and storms that can trigger health emergencies over timescales from days to weeks), to long-term climate change (such as timing of the onset of seasons and average number of hot days and nights over decades). The implementation of each component should therefore consider decisions with the aim to improve service delivery and health system performance in the short- (days to years), medium- (5-10 years) as well as long-term (decades) perspectives.

Ensure adaptive management approaches exist

Adaptive management is a structured and iterative process of decision-making and implementation that is especially useful in the context of uncertainty. Adaptive management processes and approaches use active learning methods to help accrue multiple perspectives of information that can reduce uncertainty over time and adjust the system according to changes.
In general, using tools and approaches that seek and apply feedback and new information to decision-making facilitates adaptive management. For example, risk assessments clarify the scale of local needs; clients, staff and partners surveys provide insights on effectiveness; monitoring identifies stepwise changes in conditions; scenario-planning of project performance and failure under diverse conditions identifies limitations; and pilot projects or pretesting helps improve project or process design before scaling up. Each of these processes or tools provides ways of introducing phased implementation and allowing for adjustments and modifications to be made based on early lessons and available information. This framework encourages adaptive management approaches and processes.
Ensure community approaches and voices to strengthen health action
Community action is critical to achieve climate-resilience relevant to each of the 10 components listed below. The health impacts of climate change on individuals and communities are determined at the local level by changes in local conditions and health behaviours from available information. Thus partnerships of government, academic institutions and civil society with communities are key to understanding the nature of local risks and vulnerability, and to developing appropriate solutions to protect health. Communities can play important roles in improving the quality of assessments, risk monitoring, communications, capacity building and programming. Community-based action is a principal mechanism for ensuring that people themselves are informed, educated and able to take appropriate action to protect and maintain their individual and families’ health. Resilience can be strategically built through good development policy and practices that take climate change into consideration and empower communities.
3.5 Connecting to the “building blocks” of health systems
Health systems vary around the world, but all share some common features in their ultimate goals and general functions. WHO has identified six common “building blocks” (10) that are necessary to support the delivery of Universal Health Coverage and improved outcomes (Figure 3). To ensure that climate resilience builds on and strengthens existing health systems, these building blocks are taken as a starting point for the expansion of primary components that specifically enhance climate resilience. 1

1. Leadership and governance. In addition to the core functions of ensuring good governance, evidence-informed policy and accountability within the traditional health system itself, the climate resilience approach requires leadership and strategic planning to address the complex and long-term nature of climate change risks. It particularly calls for collaboration to develop a shared vision among diverse stakeholders, and coordinated cross-sectoral planning to ensure that policies are coherent and health promoting, particularly in sectors that have a strong influence on health, such as water and sanitation, nutrition, energy and urban planning.
2. Health workforce. Overall, health system functioning relies on a sufficient number of trained and resourceful staff, working within an organizational structure that allows the health system to effectively identify, prevent and manage health risks. Building climate resilience requires additional professional training in linking climate change to health, and an investment in the organizational capacity to work flexibly and effectively in response to other conditions affected by climate change. It also requires raising the awareness of links between climate and health with key audiences (including but not limited to health policy makers, senior staff, the media), and in particular empowering affected communities to take ownership of their own response to new health challenges.
3.  Health information systems. This building block focuses particularly on health information systems, including disease surveillance, as well as the research that is required to continue to make health-related progress against persistent and emerging threats. In the context of climate change, there is a specific need for: (i) information on vulnerability to climate risks, existing and expected future capacity of the system to respond, and identification of adaptations; (ii) integration of climate information into disease surveillance, providing an opportunity to develop early warning systems and more accurate target interventions; and (iii) guidance and utilization of the rapidly emerging body of research on health and climate change.
4. Essential medical products and technologies. This traditionally aims to ensure provision of proven, safe and cost-effective healthcare interventions. The challenge of climate change requires a wider perspective, which includes the selection of more climate- resilient intervention options both within the healthcare and in health-determining sectors, from renewable energy in health facilities to climate resilient water and sanitation infrastructure. It requires attention to utilization of innovative technologies (such as remote sensing for disease surveillance) and involves reducing the environmental impact of healthcare as a means to long-term sustainability.
5. Service delivery. Building and expanding traditional systems of healthcare delivery to enhance climate resilience includes attention to: (i) the integration of climate change considerations, particularly the use of meteorological information, into existing programmes for control of climate-sensitive diseases (e.g. vector-borne diseases); (ii) improved management of the environmental determinants of health, such as water and sanitation, nutrition and air quality, taking into account the modifying effect of socioeconomic conditions; and (iii) disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness and management, in relation to the health consequences of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, floods and droughts.
6. Financing. In addition to meeting the existing large demand of financing curative interventions within healthcare systems, there is a need to consider a potential increase in healthcare costs due to climate-sensitive diseases, and develop new models to finance preventive intersectoral approaches. This can include leveraging climate change specific funding streams.
3.6 Ten components for building climate resilience
In order to provide a comprehensive health response to climate change, health decision makers need to consider the full range of functions that need to be strengthened to increase climate resilience.
Starting from health sector building blocks, and taking into account existing global and regional mandates, the operational framework elaborates on 10 components that together provide a comprehensive approach to integrating climate resilience into existing health systems. These can provide the structure for a health adaptation plan, including the allocation of roles and responsibilities, as well as human and financial resources.


3.7 How to use the framework
The framework components should be used to mainstream climate change into sector-wide or vertical programmes, as well as guide the holistic design of NAPs. Each component plays an important role in strengthening system capacity to address climate change. As a systemic approach, there are strong connections between the various components that serve to reinforce one another. A sound climate adaptation plan will therefore include many, if not all, of the 10 components.
Health systems vary, as do the scale and nature of the challenges with which they are faced. Therefore, the framework is not to be used as a definitive and rigid structure, but as a flexible approach that should be adapted to the national and local context.
The following sections provide a description of the main issues to consider under each component, along with proposed objectives and examples of measurable outputs to enhance climate resilience.

Components
4.1 COMPONENT 1: Leadership and governance
This component refers to the strategic consideration and management of the scope and magnitude of climate related stress and shocks to health systems now and in the future, and their incorporation into strategic health policy, both within the formal health system and in health-determining sectors.
Within the formal health sector, political leadership and the will to address the health risks of climate change are essential to ensure implementation across the full range of programmes for climate- sensitive health risks. This includes ensuring collaboration between all relevant health divisions, such as environmental health; vector control; water, sanitation and hygiene; disaster management; health information systems; policy; and finance.
At the same time, an effective response to climate change implies assessment, monitoring, regulation and management of climate- related health risks that originate in other sectors. These sectors include agriculture and food; water; waste; energy; transport; labour and industry; land planning; housing and infrastructure; and disaster management At the national level, these sectors in most countries have active programmes to respond to the impacts of climate change. With adequate coordination, investments in these sectors can be leveraged to also maximize health protection.
Accountability is an integral part of health governance. This therefore also requires engagement with, and accountability to, the wider community that are affected by the decisions taken on their behalf.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Governance: specific responsibility and accountability mechanisms on climate change and health established within the health ministry.
Policy: climate variability and change considerations reflected in main health policies and programmes. 
Cross-sectoral collaboration: cross-sectoral collaboration strengthened and synergies maximized to ensure that decisions taken in other sectors protect and promote health.
Examples of measurable outputs
Governance
Climate change and health focal points designated within the health ministry with specific programme of action and budget allocated.
Climate change and health focal points or units, working in collaboration with relevant climate-sensitive health programmes (e.g. vector-borne diseases, nutrition, infectious diseases, disaster risk reduction) to build resilience of programmes.
Policy
National strategy on health and climate change and/or H-NAP developed.
Cross-sectoral collaboration
Agreements (e.g. Memoranda of Understanding) established between the health ministry and main stakeholders at the national level (e.g. meteorological services, ministries of environment, food and agriculture, energy, transport, planning), include specific roles and responsibilities in relation to protecting health from climate change.
Health representation ensured in main climate change processes at national, regional and global levels (e.g. UNFCCC meetings and Conference of the Parties (COP), NAP, national communications to the UNFCCC).
Main policies and strategies from health-determining sectors reflect climate change and health considerations both in relation to adaptation (e.g. climate-resilient water safety plans) and mitigation (e.g. health cobenefits in transport policies).
Health impact assessments conducted for new mitigation and adaptation policies and programmes in all health-determining sectors, in accordance with article 4.1.f of the UNFCCC.
4.2 COMPONENT 2: Health workforce
This component refers to strengthening of technical and professional capacity of health personnel, the organisational capacity of health systems, and their institutional capacity to work with others.
Development of capacities specifically for climate change and health should build upon and support the more general effort to ensure adequate baseline levels of health competencies in health policy and management, research and analysis, healthcare and public health service delivery.
A health system relies upon an effective health workforce to achieve the best health outcomes possible, given available resources and circumstances. Climate variability and change may increase local demand for services, thus potentially altering the number of health workers and staff required, the type of health workers, as well as their level of training.
Technical and professional capacity of health staff can be developed through training, education, mentoring as well as experiential trial and error to: understand and use climate information for health decision-making, engage in cross-sectoral monitoring, conduct research and interventions, and effectively manage changing risks to health and health system performance. In addition, a range of competencies would become increasingly important, such as the ability to effectively work and communicate across disciplines^ analytical skills to interpret and use non health information for decision-making, and the ability to communicate climate risks to health actors and the public.
Organizational capacity refers to the availability of sufficient financial and human resources to cope with the health threats of climate change. This includes the efficient and targeted use of resources, information, knowledge and processes employed by the organization {such as resource mobilization and income generation, human resources and staffing, programme and process management), which enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of a health system to address risks associated with climate change.
It is also strategically important to develop institutional capacity, including the ability of health systems to partner with other actors. This involves the ability to define and fulfil responsibilities in collaboration with other sectors, and communicate with the public, including through the media. It is therefore important to build awareness and media capacity to effectively and responsibly communicate climate risks and associated 3
uncertainty, as well as identify how to best disseminate appropriate and constructive public service announcements.
Communities need to be aware of the challenges around them, involved in risk identification and decision-making, and empowered to effectively protect themselves. Community groups and leaders need to be prepared for local risks, know what role they play in prevention and response, and be aware of potential effective solutions and resources available to them. Communities also often have rich local information about risks, community capacity and vulnerability that can help to guide the formulation of responses. Outreach, partnerships, stakeholder engagement, and effective two-way dialogue are vital to improving how the health system works with the community.
Other sectors need to be aware of the scope and scale of health risks that originate within their sectors; and the need for effective dialogue to enable effective collaborative planning, policy and implementation of actions with co-benefits to health.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Human resources: sufficient number of health workers with the required technical capacity available to deal with the health risks posed by climate variability and change.
Organizational capacity development: resources, information, knowledge and processes employed by health organizations used in an efficient and targeted manner in the face of additional risks posed by climate variability and change.
Communications and awareness raising: raise awareness of the link between climate variability/climate change and health outcomes among different target audiences (e.g. policy makers, senior staff, media and communities).

Health professionals, the media and community leaders trained in risk communication, including communication of uncertainty.
Stakeholder forum on protecting health from climate change established as a way to engage health-determining sectors and the community.

4.3 COMPONENT 3: Vulnerability, capacity and adaptation assessment
 This component includes the range of assessments that can be used to generate policy-relevant evidence on the scale and nature of health risks, and the most vulnerable populations, taking into account the local circumstances.
 Health risks vary depending on the nature of the exposure {e.g. if the location of a population makes it prone to drought or to flooding), the projected changes in climatic conditions and associated hazards {e.g. projected change in precipitation patterns or climate suitability for infectious disease transmission), socioeconomic and environmental determinants at the population and individual level {e.g. age, gender coverage of water, sanitation and hygiene systems), and the capacity of health systems to protect from current and future risks {e.g. the effectiveness of disease surveillance systems and the degree to which they are flexible to sudden shocks or to gradually changing patterns of disease risk). Similarly, the scope of available adaptation options will depend on the governance and institutional arrangements within the country, and the availability of human and financial resources, among other factors.
 Climate vulnerability and adaptation (V&A) assessments are an essential tool for health policy and programmatic planning (11),
 Their objective is to assess which populations are most vulnerable to different kinds of health effects, to identify weaknesses in the systems that should protect them, and to specify interventions to respond. Assessments can also improve evidence and understanding of the linkages between climate and health, serve as a baseline
 analysis against which changes in disease risk and protective measures can be monitored, identify knowledge gaps, provide the opportunity for building capacity, and strengthen the case for investment in health protection, V&A assessments are not one-time studies, but iterative processes that involve phased investigation, periodic review, additional studies and assessments to update with new information, and active stakeholder communication.
 Successful V&A assessment processes will often include inputs from academic experts, to ensure high quality evidence, as well as managerial and operational personnel to ensure relevance to policy and practice. The studies will examine health risks, such as heat stress, nutrition and vector-borne diseases separately, and consider how they interact with each other and with changes in other determinants, such as ageing and urbanization. Assessment teams will consider opportunities and constraints for responses throughout the causal pathway, from managing environmental health determinants, to disease surveillance, to control and treatment of specific diseases. Critically, the process will involve a range of stakeholders and use information from a variety of sources, including health and non-health scientific information, as well as community knowledge and feedback

Throughout the V&A assessment process a range of additional studies, analytical exercises and tools may be used to gain a more holistic perspective of health vulnerability to climate. These include:
• Vulnerability and risk mapping
• Modelling
• Scenario development
• Health system capacity and performance assessments
• Economic assessments
• Health impact assessments of decisions in other sectors
• Specific risk, events and hazard assessments.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Vulnerability: a sound understanding of the main health risks posed by climate vulnerability and change, and of the most vulnerable population groups available in the country or region.
Capacity: baseline information on capacities and gaps within the health system to face the challenges posed by climate change.
Adaptation options: information on the main adaptation options available, including their comparative advantages, potential costs and efficiency, available for selection by health system decision makers.

4.4 COMPONENT 4: Integrated risk monitoring and early warning
 Climate change is altering the incidence and distribution of many important health risks including the occurrence of extreme weather events, and the transmission of vector-, water- and food-borne diseases. Building climate resilience entails:
 (i) developing adequate capacity and flexibility to understand how climatic conditions influence health outcomes; (ii) being able to anticipate changing health risks; and (iii) informing preparedness, surveillance and response to needs in a timely manner.
 The objective of integrated risk monitoring is to generate a holistic perspective of health risks with real-time information. It uses a set of diverse instruments to bring together information about climatic and environmental conditions, health conditions and response capacity. It is the basis for establishing early warning systems to identify, forecast and communicate high-risk conditions.
 Integrated risk monitoring refers to the use of early detection tools and epidemiological surveillance used in conjunction with direct and remote sensing technologies for surveillance of environmental determinants of health {e.g. water and air quality, variability in ambient temperature and humidity or incidence of extreme weather events). Monitoring a broad range of signals around a health risk can allow changing conditions to be identified more quickly in order to anticipate outbreaks and emergencies related to weather and climatic conditions. One advantage of integrated monitoring is that environmental data may be more standardized and readily available than population health data.
 Tracking qualitative and quantitative information about community
 and health system vulnerability, preparedness and response capacity levels are also important components of risk monitoring. For example, it is important to maintain up-to- date information on: whether high-risk regions have adequate staff and supplies during cyclone season; whether certain areas have high concentrations of vulnerable groups; and to identify regions and/or health facilities that could be more vulnerable to extreme events due to setbacks caused by recent disasters, loss of leadership or resources.
 Health early warning systems are designed to anticipate and alert the public and health professionals that a rapid-onset emergency such as an extreme weather event or disease outbreak, is expected. This advanced alert can provide additional lead-time to deploy appropriate preparedness measures and responses. Effective monitoring and early warning systems can prevent avoidable illness injury and death when coupled with adequate response capacity.

Information sources on climate-risks may originate from local community knowledge, as well as multiple fields of scientific and practice-based knowledge (epidemiology, meteorology and climate, environment, agriculture, water resource management, etc.). Relevant information maybe qualitative or quantitative, as well as observational or modelled. Because information on environmental and climate conditions are generally best collected and analysed by their respective authorities, health authorities are not always expected to collect these additional data. It is recommended to establish partnerships with meteorological agencies, hydrological services, or others to access and appropriately interpret non-health information.
Objectives for the implementation of this component
Integrated disease surveillance and early warnings: data on climate-sensitive environmental risks and epidemiological trends collected, analysed and interpreted on a continual basis and timely response to risks promoted.
Monitoring: information on climate change impacts, vulnerability, response capacity and emergency preparedness capacity reported over time.
Communication: timely warnings communicated to health decision-makers, the media and the public and translated into effective action to prevent negative health outcomes.
Examples of measurable outputs
Integrated disease surveillance and early warnings
Early detection tools (e.g. rapid diagnostics, syndromic surveillance) used to identify changing incidence and early action triggered.
Geographic and seasonal distribution of health risks and outcomes (i.e. risk mapping) tracked.
Early warning systems for relevant extreme weather events and climate-sensitive diseases (e.g. heat-stress, zoonotic diseases, undernutrition) established.

Periodic reviews for improvements or deterioration of capacities identified in V&A assessments.
Impacts of main environmental determinants of health monitored by the health sector.
Communication
Communication strategy on climate risks to health developed and implemented, outlining the scope of information for diverse audiences (e.g. media, public, health personnel and other sectors) and events, including who should communicate, and the means of communication. Community engagement and feedback mechanisms established to empower affected populations to respond to warnings, and to guide future development of monitoring and warning systems.

4.5 COMPONENT 5: Health and climate research
 Building climate resilience calk for both basic and applied research so as to reduce uncertainty about how local conditions may be affected, gain insight into local solutions and capacities, and build evidence to strengthen decision-making.
 Research from global to local level can be used to gather knowledge on climate risks to health; the modulating effect of social and environmental determinants; climate -sensitivity of diseases and risks; how communities and health systems currently understand and cope with climate risks; how local conditions and vulnerabilities are connected to broader determinants; and the degree to which communities and local health services are prepared to cope with climate-related changes and shocks. Applied research that can develop and test new technologies, data tools and instruments, and strategies for risk management are also critical to evidence-based decision-making.
 Research should inform existing knowledge management platforms, be effectively communicated, and find opportunities to be translated to practice. Guidance on priority knowledge gaps and ideas to shape national research can be found in global and regional level research agendas, such as those led by WHO (12). These may be made more relevant through adaptation to the specific national or subnational context.
 Objectives for the implementation of this component
 Research agenda: multidisciplinary national research agenda on climate change and health defined and endorsed by stakeholders.
 Support for research: research capacity on climate change and health built by supporting relevant multidisciplinary networks, making available financial resources and creating training opportunities.

4.6 COMPONENT 6: Climate resilient and sustainable technologies and infrastructure	
Health system resilience to climate risks builds on provision of / essential preventive and curative health products; from vaccines for climate-sensitive diseases to surgical equipment. It can be further enhanced through investment in specific technologies that can reduce vulnerability to climate risks, both within and outside the traditional health sector.
One important component is the provision of climate resilient health infrastructure and services. This includes ensuring that the siting of health facilities and the building codes that are applied account for current and projected future climate risks, such as the potential for increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, cyclones or storm surges. It also includes consideration of climate resilience of essential environmental services to health facilities, such as water and sanitation services -which may be compromised by flood or drought, and electricity supply that may be cut off during extreme weather events (13). Changing climatic conditions can also influence the effectiveness of specific medical products. For example, antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotics and diuretics may predispose their users to heat stroke or heat stress when temperatures are high.
Climate resilience can also be enhanced through the use of new technologies or approaches for better delivery of health interventions, particularly through the use of information technology. Satellite-based remote sensing of meteorology and environmental conditions on the ground have proven effective in improving the reliability of weather warnings, monitoring, surveillance and risk mapping the probability of transmission of waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Mobile communications have increased the speed and volume of health data collection while reducing costs and improving emergency response. Advances in information management technologies have greatly enhanced capacity to analyse connections between environmental and health data. Systematic integration of these technologies into disease surveillance systems can support vulnerability and adaptation assessment; as well as surveillance and early warning.
Selection of medical technologies and products with lower environmental footprint can also contribute to climate resilience and long-term sustainability. Processes and technologies such as solar-powered photovoltaic^ water pumps and vaccine chains can enhance resilience by ensuring independent water and energy supplies to remote rural facilities, and for health operations during emergencies. Use of technologies with lower energy demand can simultaneously increase resilience and decrease the impact of the health sector on the environment, such as reduced emissions of climate-altering pollutants associated with energy generation. Health systems constitute a significant share of many national economies (14). They can therefore make an important contribution to overall sustainability by taking into account environmental impacts in relation to their procurement of medical technologies, as well as energy, water; buildings, transport, food, waste disposal and management.
Adaptation of current infrastructures, technologies and processes: future climate risks systematically considered with regard to revision or upgrading of technologies, products and procedures for health system service delivery.
Promotion of new technologies: new technologies, processes and products selected and deployed to increase climate resilience through enhanced health service delivery.
Sustainability of health operations: low environmental impact technologies procured and promoted by the health sector to enhance resilience to climate and contribute to long-term sustainability.

4.7 COMPONENT 7: Management of environmental determinants of health
 Climate change threatens health through environmental determinants, strongly mediated by social conditions. For this reason, some of the most effective actions that can be taken by health systems are in collaboration with other sectors, i.e. through promoting a ""Health in all policies” approach.
 Scaling up multi-sectoral public health prevention programmes can avoid negative health outcomes at their source and facilitate timely and increasingly effective responses to changing environmental and climate- related risk conditions. Health-related policies and programmes in sectors, such as agriculture, transport, housing and energy can lead to reduced health risks and improved health practices, behaviours and processes.
 While the health sector does not usually have direct control over environmental determinants, they have essential roles to play at both policy and programmatic levels in providing evidence and raising awareness, joint monitoring of environmental exposures and outcomes, defining regulatory standards and management of health risks. This requires active coordination and inter-sectoral planning.
Monitoring: joint monitoring of climate-sensitive environmental risks against evidence- based standards.
Regulation:	regulatory policies protecting populations against climate-sensitive
environmental risks defined, revised and enforced.
Coordinated management: environmental determinants of health jointly managed, with clear roles and responsibilities defined across sectors.
Examples of measurable outputs
Monitoring
Integrated monitoring systems allowing collection and analysis of data on environmental hazards, socioeconomic factors and health outcomes established.
Evidence-based quality standards for climate-sensitive environmental conditions defined.
Regulation

Building regulations and waste management infrastructure, environmentally sustainable and resistant to likely local extreme events promoted.
Coordinated management

Joint multisectoral risk management approaches to health risks related to disasters, water, waste, food and air pollution (e.g. food safety, diarrhoeal disease control, integrated vector management, joined-up risk communication) undertaken.
4.8 COMPONENT 8: Climate-informed health programmes
 Health programming and operations should consider climate risks and vulnerability and increasingly become climate-resilient through assessment, programming and implementation.
 In addition to collaboration with other actors, the health sector is also often directly responsible for programmes that address climate-sensitive health risks (such as vector-borne and waterborne diseases), health response during extreme weather events and nutritional crises.
 Health programming and operations should increasingly be designed and implemented taking into account both current climate variability and projected future climate change. In combination with other factors, these will influence the geographical distribution, timing of occurrence and intensity of burden of these climate-sensitive diseases.
 Existing efforts in disaster risk reduction, public health preparedness, and several vertical programmes for communicable and n on commun icable diseases may either not be adequate, be rendered ineffective or unsustainable, or not be needed. Such pregrammes can become climate resilient by using information about current and projected future climate conditions to identify capacity gaps and inform policy, strategic investment and planning decisions.
 Specific health programmes can use information gathered through the implementation of the component related to “information and early warning systems” {e.g. V&A assessments, research, integrated risk monitoring and early warning systems) to improve their decisionmaking capabilities and adjust the scale of intervention accordingly.
 For example, health programming informed by early warnings about a potential outbreak or heat wave can use time wisely to prepare operations for increased patient loads and special needs. Climate-informed programming will continually review and adjust service delivery according to new information.

4.10 COMPONENT 10: Climate and health financing
Effectively protecting health from climate change will incur financial costs for health systems. For example, health systems may need to expend resources to expand the geographic or seasonal range or population coverage of surveillance and control programmes for climate-sensitive infectious diseases, or to retrofit health facilities to withstand more extreme weather events. Additional investment may also be needed in other sectors to achieve health goals, such as implementing climate resilient water safety plans, or enhanced food security forecasting and nutritional screening during droughts.
In order to mobilize and apply resources to these issues, assessments of resource requirements, available finance, finance gaps and opportunities to fill them, are all needed. Resource requirements can be assessed through budgeting of interventions selected in the previously described components, and compared with existing budgets and funding sources to identify shortfalls that need to be addressed through mobilization of new resources. For example, if an increase in extreme weather events is predicted, then resources will need to be mobilized for contingencies or to cover the costs of insurance or replacement costs for damaged health facilities, and lost or damaged uninsured equipment in extreme weather events. Planning and management teams should consider that in addition to adequate development funds to maintain cere healthcare and public health services {i.e. water/sanitation/ environmental hygiene/ disaster and health emergency preparedness), climate change- specific funding mechanisms should be accessed so as to effectively build the resilience of the system.
A comprehensive approach to financing health protection from climate change will first build on cere investments in the health sector, such as investments to ensure adequate numbers of trained health personnel, and bade health infrastructure and services, which also help to address climate change risks. This can be from national resources or external donors. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provides significant support to combat diarrhoeal diseases and malaria, as well as for emergency response, which simultaneously improves health and decreases vulnerability to climate change. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) supports overall malaria control, including some investments specifically in collection of meteorological data, to predict and manage seasonal and inter-annual variations in malaria transmission.
Resources can also be mobilized by combining climate change and health considerations in investments in key health determining sectors. For example, national governments and donors make very large investments in water and sanitation, which improve health and generally reduce climate vulnerability. Adding criteria for climate resilience and health promotion to investment strategies can ensure that these investments bring the greatest

possible benefits in terms of human health, climate adaptation and social return on investment over the long term. This approach applies to international as well as national financing streams. For example, the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery has funding streams on both adaptation and mitigation. Investments for risk reduction in sectors ranging from water resources to food and nutrition security can protect and promote health.
Opportunities are now becoming available to mobilize additional resources specifically to address additional risks presented by climate change, including for health. At the international level, the main multilateral mechanisms are mandated under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, promoting financial assistance from more developed parties to those countries deemed more vulnerable and with fewer resources available to adapt to climate change. Parties to the UNFCCC have mandated the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to manage the Special Climate Change Fund and the Least Developed Countries Fund, established the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol and recently the Green Climate Fund (16). Further guidance on entry points for health under each of these funding streams is provided by WHO (17). In addition to the main international climate change specific funding mechanisms, funding is also available through bilateral and regional channels.

Components 35

Monitoring progress
Monitoring of both the implementation of this framework and the extent to which its aim to build climate resilient health systems is achieved, is fundamental for it to be effective.
The intended ultimate impact of implementing the operational framework will be a decrease in the burden of climate-sensitive diseases, and a strengthening in the overall resilience of the health system. The following table includes proposed indicators of progress at the outcome level for each of the six building blocks of health systems. The examples of measurable outputs proposed for each of the components above has also been added to the table so as to provide a comprehensive monitoring framework.









Conclusions
Climate change, interacting with a range of other factors, places increasing stress on health. The structured framework presented here aims to ensure that health systems provide a comprehensive, efficient and equitable response, and ultimately continue to protect and improve population health in light of the varied current and future risks presented by climate variability and climate change. This approach is grounded in the core functions of the health sector, but linked to the wider environmental and social determinants of health.
In addition to changes in climate and other environmental and social determinants of health, health systems themselves are also changing rapidly. For this reason, the framework should be implemented in a flexible way to take into account different country contexts, and iteratively, take advantage of new evidence, experience and lessons learned from within and outside the country, as well as changing circumstances. Applied in this way, climate resilient health systems can help to promote and safeguard the provision of Universal Health Coverage, and make an important contribution to overall sustainable development.

Terminology
This section draws upon glossaries and definitions provided by the IPCC (5), the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (18), and WHO (19) .
Adaptation: refers to the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, human interventions may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. In public health, the analogous term is “prevention”. Various types of adaptations exist, including anticipatory and reactive, private and public, autonomous and planned. Adaptation responds to immediate threats of climate vulnerability (commonly addressed with disaster risk reduction, emergency response and epidemic management), but primarily seeks to identify and plan for large-scale risks and trends posed by long-term environmental and climatic changes such as sea-level rise, changing ground and surface water availability, changes in disease vector distribution and crop pests, changes in air quality, glacial retreat, UV exposures, and extreme and increasing temperatures. Resilience to climate change usually requires a capacity to anticipate climate change and plan needed adaptations.
Adaptive capacity is the ability of a system to adjust to climate change, to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.
Climate change refers to any change in the climate over time, generally decades or longer, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity.
Climate variability refers to trends in variation in the mean state and other statistics of the climate on all temporal and spatial scales beyond that of individual weather events. Extreme weather (storms, extreme temperatures) and climate events (drought) are part of climate variability trends.
Climate-resilient health systems have the ability to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate-related shocks and stresses, so as to bring sustained improvements in population health, despite an unstable climate.
Climate-sensitive health outcome is any health outcome whose geographic range, incidence or intensity of transmission is directly or indirectly associated with weather or climate.
Climate-related risks are additional (exacerbated) risks that people and their livelihoods and assets face due to climate change. These risks can be direct, such as in exposure to more frequent heat waves or floods; or indirect, such as when a drought negatively impacts food supplies (and prices) and in effect livelihoods and nutrition. Certain groups may also face increased risks from measures taken in response to climate change (such as adaptation measures that protect certain areas of a city from flooding but increase flood-risks in other areas) or for mitigation (such as new hydropower schemes displacing populations or increasing malaria vector breeding sites).

Exposure is the amount of a factor to which a group or individual is exposed; sometimes contrasted with dose (the amount that enters or interacts with the organism). Exposures may be either beneficial or harmful. Exposure to climatic conditions that affect health is heavily influenced by location, socioeconomic conditions and human behaviour.
Climate risk management is an approach to identify hazards and impacts associated with both climate variability and climate change, and provides tools for decision-making in response. Climate risk management aims to reduce negative impacts through ‘climate informed decisions” which couple information about the climate system and meteorological conditions along with the known associations to health outcomes, and incorporates this knowledge into decision-making on planning, forecasting, systems management and geographic or spatial targeting, or risk management interventions. Climate risk management encourages handling of current climate-related risks as a basis for managing and building capacity to address more complex, long-term risks associated with climate change.
Climate change mitigation refers to policies and measures used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (carbon) and/or enhance sinks such as forests, as a means to slow down and reduce future and more dangerous climate change. Climate change mitigation is primary prevention of future harm for decades in the future and necessitates public education and awareness along with use of low-carbon technology.
A disaster is a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.
Disaster risk is the potential loss expressed in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur in a particular community or a society due to the impact of a natural hazard.
Disaster risk reduction is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing disaster risk. Specifically, disaster risk reduction aims to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society in order to avoid (prevent) or limit (mitigate and prepare for) the adverse impacts of natural hazards, and facilitate sustainable development. Disaster risk reduction addresses climate-related disasters (drought, extreme weather events such as floods, cyclones, and storms) and encompasses nonclimatic hazards, such as tsunamis, volcanoes and earthquakes.
A health system comprises all the organizations, institutions and resources that are devoted to producing actions principally aimed at improving, maintaining or restoring health. Health systems involve numerous stakeholders from individual and community to government, at local, subnational and national levels. The health system is recognized by WHO to be made up of six key building blocks: (i) leadership and governance; (ii) health workforce; (iii) health information systems; (iv) essential medical products and technologies; (v) financing; all of which lead to (vi) service delivery. The goal of a health system is to deliver effective preventive and curative health services to the full population, equitably and efficiently, while protecting individuals from catastrophic healthcare costs.

Health system strengthening refers to improving the six health system building blocks and managing their interactions in ways that achieve more equitable and sustained improvements across health services and health outcomes, requiring both technical and political knowledge as well as action.
Resilience is the capacity of a social-ecological system to cope with a hazardous event or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain its essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.
Vulnerability is the degree to which individuals and systems are susceptible to or unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change including climate variability and extremes. The vulnerability and coping capacity of particular populations to changing meteorological conditions and its human and social consequences is influenced by a variety of factors. These include biological factors, sociocultural factors and access to and control over resources.

Foreword



The dramatic impact of climate variability and climate change continued to be felt all over the world throughout 2013. The WMO Statement on the Status of the Global Climate in 2013 provides a snapshot of global and regional trends in weather and climate over the past year and highlights some of the year's most significant extreme events.

The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warm - est since global records began in 1350. Although the climate varies naturally from year to year, it is clear that the planet is experiencing an overall warming trend. Thirteen of the fourteen warmest years on record have all occurred in the twenty-first century, and each of the past three decades has been warmer than the last, culminating with 2001-2010 as the warmest decade on record. As highlighted by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, this steady warming is caused by rising levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
We now have a better understanding of hum an- induced climate change, and climate scientists can increasingly determine how large-scale pressure and temperature patterns influence the weather. The best known of these is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean, which affects weather patterns around the world through ""teleconnections"". I n addition to EN SO, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, jet streams and other recurring patterns also often explain why weather conditions are wetter, drier, warmer, cooler or stormier than average.

Weather forecasting, including the prediction of storms and other hazards, has greatly evolved in recent years. In October 2013, the events surrounding Cyclone Phaifin, the second strongest tropical cyclone to strike India since modern records began, showed how improved forecasting, combined with government action to build national resilience and provide shelters, greatly reduces the loss of life. Nevertheless, extreme events can still cause fatalities and destroy property, so we must continue enhancing preparedness, strengthening early warning systems and implementing a multi-hazard approach to disaster risk reduction.
The Statement draws on input from leading research institutions and from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of WMO Members. This summary has been published in all six official WMO languages in order to reach the broadest possible readership. However, I also strongly encourage interested readers to exam ine the m ore detailed underlying report, which is available on the WMO website.



Preface



This Statement is based on datasets and information that were made available by WMO Members and partners for 2013 and assessed in their global and regional geographical context. Comparisons were made with climatological averages and records (historical background) whenever possible and appropriate.
The global temperature assessment is based on three independent datasets that are maintained by the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia (HadCRU), both in the United Kingdom; the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NCDC-NOAA), based in the United States; and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), also in the United States. The HadCRU dataset extends back to 1850, and the NCDC and GISS datasets (and hence the combined dataset) extend back to 1880. Other datasets have also been used for additional analysis.
The content was developed and peer-reviewed by several experts affiliated with international and regional climate institutions, centres and programmes, and by the world's National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs), the main providers of the underlying observations and climate information. More than 50 NMHSs provided direct input to the Statement following the WMO call for contributions. Many others made their data and climate reports available on their websites, and these were accessed when necessary. When doubts arose as to facts and figures, WMO communicated with the relevant national source in order to verify the information before its inclusion in the Statement. The definition of the Regions is based on the WMO regional structure, as follows:
• Africa (Region I)
• Asia (Region II)
• South America (Region III)
• North America, Central America and the Caribbean (Region IV)
• South-West Pacific (Region V)
• Europe (Region VI)
WMO Climate System Monitoring uses Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) as defined by the Global Climate Observing System. Some 50 ECVs have been identified as fundamental for global observation. This Statement incorporates assessments of the status of the global climate and observed extremes detected using ECV data and products, including air temperature, precipitation, stratospheric ozone and long-lived greenhouse gases (atmospheric ECVs); snow cover, ice sheets and soil moisture (terrestrial ECVs); as well as sea ice, sea level rise, sea surface temperature and ocean acidification (oceanographic ECVs).

TEMPERATURES
The year 2013 tied with 2007 as the sixth warmest since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 0.50°C ±0.10°C (0.90°F ±0.18°F) above the 1961-1990 average and 0.03°C (0.05°F) above the 2001-2010 average. The past year was also warmer than both 2011 and 2012, which, though marked by cooling La Niña conditions, were 0.43°C and 0.46°C above average, respectively.
Warming El Niño and cooling La Niña events are major drivers of natural variability in the climate system. Neither condition was present during 2013, which was among the four warmest ENSO-neutral years on record. Thirteen of the fourteen warmest years on record, including 2013, have all occurred in the twenty-first century. The warmest on record are 2010 and 2005, followed by 1998. El Niño conditions dominated the early months of 2010 and 1998, and weak El Niño-type conditions extended from 2004 to the first half of 2005.
To arrive at these figures, WMO takes an average of the three main global temperature datasets, which are managed separately and use different methodologies. Other datasets produce similar but slightly different results. A separate temperature analysis conducted by the Japan Meteorological Agency, for example, estimates that 2013 was the second warmest year on record. According to reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2013 tied with 1998 as the fourth warmest since 1958.
Because the capacity for heat absorption differs over land and over sea, the air over the land tends to warm up faster. Across the world's land surfaces, the 2013 global air temperature was 0.85°C ±0.17°C above the 1961-1990 average and 0.06°C above the 2001-2010 average, the fourth highest on record. A very warm November-December period that ranked second behind 2006 contributed to this high temperature anomaly. Over the global ocean, the surface temperature for 2013 tied with 2004 and 2006 as the sixth warmest on record, at 0.35°C ±0.07°C above the 1961-1990 average.
The northern hemisphere's weather patterns during early 2013 were largely influenced by the Arctic Oscillation. This brought cooler- than-average spring temperatures to much of Europe, the south-eastern United States, north-western Russian Federation and parts of Japan. The Arctic region, meanwhile, was considerably warmer than average, along with much of central and northern Africa, the eastern Mediterranean, southern Russian Federation and much of China. This so-called warm Arctic, cold continents pattern is characteristic of the Arctic Oscillation's negative phase. The year 2013 saw the most negative Arctic Oscillation on record for the month of March. A similar pattern with high pressure over Greenland and low pressure to the south re-emerged in late spring, once again causing cold Arctic air to surge into western and central Europe.
In the southern hemisphere, summer was extremely warm, with monthly January temperature anomalies reaching +5°C in parts of Australia. Exceptional warm conditions were also present during the winter, with New Zealand experiencing its warmest winter on record. The beginning of austral summer 2013/2014 was very hot in parts of South America, with the December temperature reaching new record highs. As a result of the continued warmth throughout the year across parts of the southern hemisphere, 2013 was the warmest year on record in Australia, second warmest in Argentina and third warmest in New Zealand. Modelling experiments have indicated that the odds of the record Australian hot summer occurring were increased fivefold by human-induced climate change (see page 20 and accompanying figure).

RAIN, SNOW AND ICE
Global precipitation during 2013 equalled the 1961-1990 average of 1 033 mm, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (United States). Precipitation at the regional level, however, varied significantly. For example, wetter-than-average conditions were seen across most of Greenland, the southern Arabian Peninsula, central India and western China. Drier-than-average conditions were present over the western United States, much of northern Canada, northern Siberia and the eastern inland of Australia.
Winter snow cover in North America has varied widely over the past few years. During the 2012/2013 winter, snow cover extent was 500 000 km2 above the 1931-2010 average, resulting in the fourteenth largest winter extent for the continent since records began in 1966. During the spring. North Am erican snow cover was 330 000 km2 above average, making it the tenth largest spring extent for the continent and the largest since 1997.
During the same period, snowcover extent across the Eurasian continent was 1.71 million km2 above the 1931-2010 average, the third largest winter extent on record for this region and the largest since 2003. In the spring, the continent's snow cover contracted significantly to 430 000 km2 below average, resulting in the fourteenth smallest extent on record for the season. In May,Eurasian snow cover dipped to 7.3 million km2, setting a new record low for that month.
As further evidence of the rapid response of the Arctic cryosphere to increasing air temperatures, the northern hemisphere June snow cover is currently decreasing at a faster rate than Arctic summer minimum sea-ice extent, and at rates that exceed the projection of climate models. June 2013snowcover across the hemisphere was the second lowest, greater only than the record low of 2012.
Soil moisture is a key variable for monitoring the climate system because it strongly influences the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Very wet soil conditions resulting from hydro-meteorological events were noticeable and had an impact on floods in a number of regions including eastern parts of the Russian Federation, north-eastern China, India, the Philippines and central Europe. On the other hand, annual soil moisture anomalies indicated dryness in the southern hemisphere, where Australia, South America and southern Africa experienced severe drought conditions during the first part of the year.

Arctic sea-ice extent reached its annual maxim um on 15 March at 15.13 million km2. This was approximately 0.5 million km2 below the average 1931-2010 annual maximum, making it the sixth smallest maximum sea-ice extent since satellite records began in 1979. During the 2012/2013 growth season, Arctic sea-ice extent grew by 11.72 million km2, the largest seasonal increase on record; this growth can be explained by the record small sea-ice extent of September 2012. Arctic maximum sea-ice extent in March has decreased at an average rate of 2.6 percent per decade.
Another way to assess the state of the Arctic sea ice is to estimate the age of the ice, given that first-year ice is the thinnest and most susceptible to melting. Ice that was four years of age and older decreased from 13 per cent of the ice cover in March 1934 to 2 per cent in March 2012. It increased slightly to 3 per cent in 2013. In March 1934, 56 per cent of the ice pack was composed of first-year ice, while in March 2013 first-year ice comprised 73 percent of total ice cover at its peak.
The Arctic reached its annual minimum sea- ice cover on 13 September, at 5.10 million km2 or 13 per cent below the 1931-2010 average minimum, making it the sixth smallest annual minimum on record. All seven of the lowest Arctic sea-ice extents in the satellite record have occurred in the last seven years,beginning with 2007. September Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased at an average rate of 13.7 per cent per decade. The total minimum sea-ice volume, which combines measures of ice extent and model simulations of ice thickness, was higher in 2013 than in 2010,2011 and 2012, but lower than in 2007 and well below the 1979-2012 average.
February marked the end of the Antarctic sea-ice melt season in 2013. The annual minimum extent of sea ice was reached on 20 February at 3.63 million km2. This was the second largest annual minimum sea-ice extent for Antarctica. In addition, Antarctic sea-ice extent reached a record maximum for the second year in a row. On 1 October, it was 19.57 million km2,2.7 per cent higher than the 1931-2010 average.

September Antarctic sea-ice extent has increased at an average rate of 1.1 per cent per decade.

Scientists believe that changes in atmospheric circulation over the past three decades, which have weakened the prevailing winds that circle Antarctica, may be a factor. The increasing extent of the ice may also be linked to changing ocean circulation and a build-up of cold freshwater on the surface of the Southern Ocean due to increasing precipitation and melting land-based ice shelves.
Melting at the surface of the Greenland ice sheet was much less dramatic in 2013 than in the record year of 2012. It peaked in late July, when satellites detected melting over 44 per cent of the surface. This coincided with record warmth in south-western Greenland (30 July saw a temperature of 25.9°C in Maniitsoq, the highest temperature ever recorded in Greenland). The last decade has experienced accelerated melting of the sea-ice cover and mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet.
OCEANS
The ocean acts as an effective buffer for the climate system by absorbing and storing a large amount of excess carbon and heat from the atmosphere. It has absorbed approximately one quarter of all the carbon dioxide <C02) released into the atmosphere by humans since the start of the industrial revolution. This absorbed C02 forms a weak carbonic acid, which causes ocean acidification. As a result, the pH of the ocean has decreased by 0.11, which corresponds approximately to a 30 per cent increase in acidity. Ocean acidification is already harming corals, shellfish and other marine life.
While the rate at which surface air temperatures are rising has slowed in recent years, heat continues to be trapped in the Earth system, mostly as increased ocean heat content. About 93 per cent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth system between 1971 and 2010 was taken up by the ocean. From around 1930 to 2000, the ocean gained about 50 zettajoules (1021 joules) of heat. Between 2000 and 2013, it added about three times that amount. Prior to 2000, most of the heat was trapped between the sea surface and a depth of 700 m. Since then, most of the heat has been stored at depths of 700 m to 2 000 m. The increased uptake in this region may be due to changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns in the tropical Pacific and to interactions with large-scale climate patterns such as ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.
Globally, sea level has risen by 19 cm since the start of the twentieth century, mostly because of the thermal expansion of the oceans and the melting of glaciers and ice caps. Since measurements began in 1993, sea level has been rising at about 2.9-3.2 mm/yr (based on two separate estimates, each with an uncertainty of ±0.4 mm/yr), with some year-to-year variability.

This range encompasses the observed rate of about 3 mm/yr for the 2001-2010 decade and is around double the observed twentieth century trend of 1.6 mm/yr.
Preliminary analyses indicate that the global average sea level reached a new record high in March. Some regions of the globe are experiencing greatersea-level rise than others (some are even experiencing declining sea levels) due to local variations in currents, land movements and ocean warming. The region of the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines has observed some of the highest rising sea-level rates over the past half century. This contributed to the enormous devastation in parts of the Philippine islands, when Typhoon Haiyart struck in November and caused a massive storm surge.

REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
 AFRICA
The continent experienced an overall hot year, with 2013 ranking as the second warmest on record, behind 2010. The temperature in Vioolsdrif, South Africa, soared to 47.3°C on 4 March - the hottest March temperature ever measured in Africa. In West Africa, the temperature in Navrongo, Ghana, reached 43°C on 6 March, the warmest temperature ever measured in Ghana. Several temperature records were also broken in Kenya. Spring and October temperatures in Tunisia, which were 2.2°C and 4°C above average, respectively, contributed to one of the 10 warmest years in the country since 1950.
Above-average precipitation occurred in northern Mali and adjacent areas in Algeria. Below-average precipitation was recorded along the Gulf of Guinea, from Côte d'Ivoire to Nigeria and over the southernmost parts of Ghana, Benin and Togo.
Following nearly three decades of low seasonal rainfall and a second consecutive year of failed rains, Angola and Namibia suffered one of the worst droughts of the past 30 years. An estimated 1.5 million people in southern Angola faced food insecurity, as did nearly 300 000 in Namibia. Historic drought conditions also affected La Réunion from May to September.
In Mozambique, severe flooding that killed at least 113 people and displaced 135 000 occurred in January. Heavy rainfall between March and April led to flooding that damaged crops and displaced thousands of people throughout parts of southern Somalia and eastern Kenya. Heavy rains also fell in Sudan in August, causing severe damage, killing 76 people and affecting some 500 000. Bamako, Mali, and Marrakech, Morocco were also affected by floods.

 ASIA
Summer was extremely hot in many parts of Asia. Japan, for example, had its hottest summer on record, including a national record high of 41 °C in Shimanto, Kochi Prefecture, on 12 August. Many daily maximum temperature records were broken in Hong Kong, China, in March and April, with some locations exceeding 40°C.
Chi na saw its fourth warm est year since national records began in 1961. The most severe heatwave since 1951 occurred in southern China between July and August, with temperatures over 40°C. The region also experienced severe drought conditions. Approximately 73 million people and over3 million hectares of farm land were affected, with direct economic losses estimated at US$7.7 billion.

In India, Nagpur recorded its all-time high temperature of 47.9°C on 22 May, while Amritsar observed its highest ever temperature of 43°C on both 23 and 24 May. More than 2700 people perished due to the heat. South-west Asian monsoon rainfall for the country as a whole was 106 percent of the average, but was characterized by regional variations. The monsoon had an early onset over all of India and brought the worst flooding and devastation in the past half century to regions near the India-Nepal border. North-western India received nearly double its average June rainfall; thousands of people were killed and many more went missing.
Pakistan saw its most severe heatwave in decades, with temperatures reaching 51°C in Larkana, the highest May temperature in the city since 1993. Cotton crops and rice paddies were damaged, and more than 100 people died. Punjab and Sindh provinces were inundated by floods due to heavy monsoon rains during most of August. The floods covered about 200 000 km2, killing an estimated 250 people and affecting nearly 1.5 million.
Northern East Asia had a cold period during its 2012/2013 winter season, associated with negative Arctic Oscillation conditions and blocking patterns around eastern Siberia. Most of Siberia was 2°C-3°C below average, making this one of its coldest winters of the twenty-first century.
From the end of July to mid-August, unusually heavy rain fell near the Amur river, which marks the border between China and the Russian Federation. The Songhuajiang and Liaohe river basins in north-eastern Chi na saw their heaviest floods since 1993. Massive flooding was also reported in eastern Russian Federation. More than 140 towns were affected by the worst flooding in 120 years.
 SOUTH AMERICA
Temperatures in South America were dominated by hot conditions in most parts of the continent, except for some limited areas in southern Brazil and the north-central and western parts of South America, which had near to colder than average temperatures. A warm October-December period - including the hottest December on record - contributed to the second warmest year in Argentina since records began in 1961, behind only the record warmth of 2012. In December, the most significant heatwave since 1937 struck central and northern Argentina.
North-eastern Brazil experienced its worst drought in 50years. This followed the 2001-2010 decade, when large parts of the Amazon Basin saw prolonged drought. The Brazilian Plateau, which is the core monsoon region in South America, experienced its largest rainfall deficit since records began in 1979; damages exceeded US$8 billion.
On 2 April, La Plata, Argentina, received about 300 mm of rainfall in just three hours. The torrential downpour led to flash floods that resulted in more than 50 fatalities, making this one of the worst weather disasters in the history of Argentina. Many states in Brazil also had extremely heavy rainfall during December, with at least seven cities setting new precipitation records. In south-eastern Brazil, the city of Aimores received more than four times its average rainfall for the month.
 NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
Temperatures across most of North America were above average during 2013, but were more moderate overall than in 2012. Winter was warmerthan average in Canada and the United States, although spring in the contiguous United States was the coolest since 1996. Temperatures in the United States rebounded during the summer, and the warmth continued into September.

Summer in Alaska was the second hottest on record, and October-December was the sixth warmest such period on record for the state. Mexico experienced a record warm July and August and a warm autumn.
In Canada, 2013 was the thirteenth driest year on record. Nevertheless, torrential downpours overwhelmed Calgary and vast areas of southern Alberta in June, forcing 100 000 people to evacuate their homes and causing close to US$ 6 billion in damage. The contiguous United States was wetter than average for the year, with some geographical variations. Two states, Michigan and North Dakota, experienced record wet conditions. Alaska observed its third wettest year on record and the wettest in the past 50 years.
A major drought that encompassed large parts of the central United States in 2012 and early 2013 improved across much of the country. By the end of 2013, about 31 per cent of the country was experiencing drought, down from about 61 per cent at the beginning of the year. California had its driest year since records began in 1895; San Francisco received only 16 per cent of its average annual rainfall since local records began in 1947. Very hot conditions, combined with strong winds and drought, contributed to the worst wildfire in Colorado history.
The contiguous United States was hit by several late-season winter storms. In April, Bismarck, North Dakota received 44 cm of snow, setting a new calendar-day record. Duluth, Minnesota and Rapid City, South Dakota each had their snowiest month on record, with 129 cm and 109 cm, respectively. El Reno, Oklahoma, was struck by a particularly powerful tornado: at 4.3 km, it was the widest tornado ever observed in the United States.
In the Caribbean, the Guadeloupe archipelago experienced strong drought conditions between January and March, and the lack of rain damaged sugar cane and banana crops. Martinique received exceptionally heavy rainfall in April.

daily maximum temperature of 40.30°C was set. The temperature in Moomba, South Australia, reached 49.6°C, the highest recorded in the state since 1960. Hobart recorded its all-time high observed temperature of 41.8°C on 4 January, while the temperature in Sydney reached 45.8°C on 18 January, the hottest since records began. During the same month, a tropical low caused major flooding along much of the east coast of Queensland and northern New South Wales. In Queensland, five people were killed and 8 000 residents were forced to evacuate as floods reached record heights.
New Zealand experienced its warmest winter on record and its third warmest year overall since national records began in 1909. The northern and eastern parts of the country had their driest year on record and suffered drought, while other parts experienced near-record high annual rainfall.



 SOUTH-WEST PACIFIC
In Australia, 2013 was the warmest year since national records began in 1910, at 1.20°C above average and 0.17°C higher than the previous record in 2005. January was the hottest month ever observed in the country. The summer (December-February) and spring (September- November) were both the hottest on record, and the winter (June-August) was the third warmest. On 7 January, a new national average daily maximum temperature of 40 30°C was set The temperature in Moomba, South Australia, reached 49 6°C, the highest recorded in the state since 1960 Hobart recorded its all-time high observed temperature of 41 8°C on 4 January, while the temperature in Sydney reached 45 8°C on 18 January, the hottest since records began During the same month, a tropical low caused major flooding along much of the east coast of Queensland and northern New South Wales In Queensland, five people were killed and 8 000 residents were forced to evacuate as floods reached record heights
New Zealand experienced its warmest winter on record and its third warmest year overall since national records began in 1909 The northern and eastern parts of the country had their driest year on record and suffered drought, while other parts experienced near-record high annual rainfall.

Drier-than-normal weather conditions since late 2012 resulted in severe drought conditions in the northern Marshall Islands. This led to critical shortages of drinking water, damaged food crops and the declaration of a national state of disaster. Abundant rain fell in June over the south of Atuona in the Marquesas Islands of French Polynesia. On 5 June, the region received 66.1 mm of precipitation in one hour. Heavy rains following an extra-tropical depression fell on New Caledonia during 1-3 July. A total of 714 mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period, setting a new record.


EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST
The year 2013 was the sixth warmest on record across Europe. Many regions were warmer than average at the start of 2013. The north-east of Iceland had its warmest January-February period on record. In Lithuania, February was 3°C warmer than average. However, the Jungfraujoch in the high mountains of Switzerland saw its coldest winter in the past 40 years.
The north of the European part of the Russian Federation experienced the coldest March in the past half century, as temperatures plunged 8°C -10°C below average in some areas. France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom all had their coolest springs in decades. In Iceland, a new minimum record for May was set when the temperature fell to -21.7°Cinthe eastern inland. At the same time, the western Greenland coast had its record warmest March, and Norway and Sweden each observed one of their warmest months of May since their national records began.
Sum m er was very hot for m any European countries. Portugal endured one of its worst July heatwaves since 1941. The extended August heatwave in Austria set a new national record high of 40.5°C. On 3 August, many stations in Slovenia observed their highest temperatures on record, with several exceeding 40°C. On the same day in Slovakia, the temperature in Bratislava reached 39.4°C, the highest since observations began in 1350.
The beginning of autumn was also anomalously warm over Europe. Unusual warmth settled over the Russian Federation towards the end of 2013. Following its record warmest November of 5.3°C above the 1961-1990 average, the country observed its record warmest December, at 4.6°C above average. Moscow and Saint Petersburg broke their daily maximum temperature records on 25 December by 0.4°C and 1.4°C, respectively.
Extreme precipitation in the Alpine region and in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland and Switzerland caused the most intense and extended flooding in the Danube and Elbe river catchments since at least 1950, as more than 400 mm of rain fell in some localized areas during 29 May-3 June. Austria observed its wettest May-June period since records began in 1353. Some rivers reached historical record heights; in Germany, Passau saw its highest water level since 1501.
During 10-15 December, a rare snowstorm hit parts of the Middle East. In Egypt, snow fell in Cairo for the first time in 112 years. The Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan and Israel also received unprecedented amounts of snow. Cold weather accompanied the storm. On 15 December, the temperature in Shoubak, Jordan, plummeted to -16°C, the lowest temperature ever recorded in the country.
An extra-tropical cyclone struck the United Kingdom on 23 October, the strongest autumn storm to hit the region since 2002. During
4- 7 December, an extra-tropical cyclone moved from west to east across northern Europe; the resulting storm surges, including in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, were the worst in the past six decades. In Germany, the storm surge reached 4-6 m above mean sea level, but dykes were 3 m tall.

TROPICAL CYCLONES
Globally, there were 94 storms during 2013 (wind speeds equal to or greater than 63 km/h).

The number of storms was higher than in 2012 <84 storms), 2011 <74 storms) and 2010 <67 storms, the lowest number in the modern satellite era). It should be noted that the total number of storms does not necessarily correlate with the number of storms that affect inhabited land areas.
The Atlantic Ocean basin experienced 13 named storms, just above the 1981-2010 average of 12 storms, but below the recent decade of 2001-2010, which saw an average of 15storms per year. No storms attained major intensity <wind speed of 178 km/h). The intensity and duration of the season's hurricanes were measured as 33 percent of the average, the lowest value since 1994.
The Eastern North Pacific basin had above-average hurricane activity in 2013. There were a total of 20 storms, 9 of which intensified to hurricane status and 1 of which (Raymond) became a major hurricane. Two hurricanes from two separate basins Ungrid in the North Atlantic and Manuel in the Eastern North Pacific) struck Mexico nearly simultaneously on 15 September. This unusual event, which had not occurred since 1958, displaced tens of thousands of residents and damaged some 22 000 homes in Guerrero state.
The Western North Pacific Ocean basin recorded a total of 31 storms, above the 1981-2010 average of 26 and well above the most recent decadal average <2001-2010) of 23, making this the most active season since 2004. Of these storms, 13 strengthened into typhoons. Typhoon Usagi (Odette) was one of the strongest cyclones globally to have formed in 2013, with 10-minute wind speeds reaching 204 km/h. In November, Typhoon Haiyan (named Yolanda in the Philippines) becam e one of the strongest storms on record to ever make landfall anywhere on the globe, with maximum 10-minute wind speeds reaching 230 km/h prior to landfall. Haiyan caused significant damage across South-East Asia, and the Philippines bore the brunt of the devastation. Storm surges of 5-6 m were reported in heavily populated low-lying areas of Tacloban and in the islands of Samar and Leyte. Damage caused by immediate surge and following inundation was the worst in the past several decades, with more than 6 200 deaths and about 14 million people affected, according to reports from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council estimated that total damages exceeded US$ 850 million in that country alone.
The North Indian Ocean basin recorded a slightly above-average season with five storms compared with the 1981-2010 average of four; three of these storms (Phailin, Lehar and Madi) evolved into very severe cyclonic storms. Phailin forced 1.1 million residents in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh states to be evacuated ahead of the storm, one of the largest such evacuations in the history of India.
Ten tropical storms were observed in the South- West Indian Ocean basin during the 2012/2013 tropical cyclone season. This is close to the long-term 1981-2010 average and the 2001-2010 average of nine tropical storms. Seven of these storms reached tropical cyclone status, which is well above the average of four.
The Australian basin recorded a near-average 2012/2013 cyclone season, with 10 tropical storms compared with the 1981-2010 average of 11 and the most recent decadal average of 9. Four of these storms became severe tropical cyclones. The strongest cyclone of the season was Rusty, with a financial impact likely exceeding US$ 100 million.

In the South-West Pacific Ocean basin, the 2012/2013 tropical cyclone season was well below average, with 5 named tropical storms compared with the 1981-2010 average of 12 and the 2001-2010 decadal average of 10. Four of these storms attained severe tropical cyclone status, similar to the 1981-2010 average. Severe Tropical Cyclone Evan was the strongest storm in the basin during the season, killing 10 people and causing damages of over US$ 300 million in Samoa and Fiji alone.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONE- DEPLETING SUBSTANCES

The WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Programme reports that atmospheric levels of C02, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20) reached new highs in 2012. Data for 2013 have not yet been compiled. Globally averaged levels of C02 reached 393.1±0.13 parts per million (ppm), 41 per cent above pre-industrial levels (before 1750). In May 2013, for the first time since observations began, daily average C02 levels at several stations outside the Arctic exceeded the symbolic threshold of 400 ppm. (C02 levels reach a seasonal maximum in the northern hemisphere spring, before vegetation growth and other processes start to absorb the C02.)
Atmospheric concentrations of CH4 reached a new high of 1 819±1 parts per billion (ppb) in 2012, or 160 per cent higher than the preindustrial level. Concentrations of N20 reached 325.1±0.1 ppb, which is 20 per cent above the pre-industrial level.
As a result, the NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index for 2012 was 1.32, representing a 32 per cent increase in total radiative forcing (relative to 1750) by all long-lived greenhouse gases since 1990. Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases are the main driver of climate change.
While chlorofluorocarbons, halons and other harmful chemicals have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, these gases can remain in the atmosphere for many years. They deplete the stratospheric ozone layer that protects life on Earth. The resulting Antarctic ozone hole contributes to changes in wind patterns and the regional climate in Antarctica. The Antarctic ozone hole reached a maximum of 23.1 million km2 on 15 September and 24 million km2 on 16 September. This is more than the seasonal maxima observed in 2010 and 2012, but somewhat less than the 4.4 million km2 seasonal maximum reached in 2011.

THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTRIBUTION SCIENCE
In 2012, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), which is sponsored by WMO, the Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Council for Science, identified six grand challenges within the climate science community. The prediction and attribution of extreme events is one of these grand challenges. Extreme climate events that have large impacts on society, both physically and economically, are increasingly requiring prompt and credible scientific explanations.
Today, there is a growing ability within the climate science community to untangle the complexities of understanding the natural and human-induced factors contributing to specific extreme weather and climate events. Recent analyses of various events show that the effects of natural weather and climate fluctuations played a key role in the intensity and evolution of many extreme events. However, for some events, the analyses revealed compelling evidence that human-caused climate change, due to the emission of heat-trapping gases, also contributed. Understanding the influences on such events helps us to better understand how and why extreme events are changing. In addition, calculating how the odds of a particular extreme event have changed provides a way to quantify the influence of climate change on these events.
The Australia summer 2012/2013 area-averaged surface air temperature was the hottest since national records began in 1910. In addition to the summer, temperature records were also broken on daily and monthly timescales. Later in 2013, new national 12-month period temperature records were set in three consecutive months: for the period ending in August, then in September and once again in October. Lastly, a new calendar-year record was set at the end of 2013.
Contributing factors to these record 2013 Australian temperatures, including

human-induced climate change and natural variability associated with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), were investigated using a suite of climate model simulations. Using nine state-of-the-art global climate models that participated in the WCRP Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, changes in the probability of extreme Australian summer temperatures due to human influences were investigated. These nine models simulate well the observed probability distribution of Australian average summer and 12-month average temperatures since 1910.
The probability of hot Australian summers was calculated for model experiments incorporating human influences (changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols and ozone in the atmosphere) and natural causes (solar radiation changes and emissions from volcanic eruptions), and this was compared with the results from a parallel set of experiments that included only natural causes. The comparison shows that human-induced climate change substantially increased the likelihood of the record-breaking Australian summer of 2013; when human influences were included in model simulations, the probability of very hot summer temperatures across Australia, such as in 2013, increased at least fivefold. These types of extreme Australian summers become even more frequent in simulations of the future under further global warming.
The recent record Australian summer was also notable because it occurred when ENSO conditions were neutral to weak La Niña; these conditions typically produce cooler temperatures across Australia. Prior to 2013, six of the eight hottest Australian summers occurred during El Niño years, but natural ENSO variations are very unlikely to explain the record 2013 Australian heat.
Using the same modelling approach, preliminary analysis of the Australian area-average temperature record for the calendar year 2013 indicates that human-induced causes vastly increased the odds of setting a new temperature record In the model experiments, it is virtually impossible to reach such a high temperature due to natural climate variations alone In simulations with only natural causes considered, none of the 13 000 model years analysed exceed the previous hottest year in Australia, which was observed in 2005 Conversely, in simulations for the period 2006–2020 that include both natural and human-induced causes, such records occur approximately once every 10 years
In summary, comparing climate model simulations with and without human factors shows that the record hot Australian summer of 2012/2013 was about five times as likely as a result of human-induced influence on climate and that
the record hot calendar year of 2013 would have been virtually impossible without human contributions of heat-trapping gases, illustrating that some extreme events are becoming much more likely due to climate change

Action-2016-1.txt,"CAMPAIGN EVALUATION     FEBRUARY 2016          Disclaimer     This is the report of independent evaluators commissioned by action/2015.   The views expressed in this report should not be taken as being the views of   action/2015, its participating organisations or its partners.       summary of key finDings     Overview: Action/2015 was a global coalition that came together united by the belief that 2015 was a   critical year for progress in the fight against climate change, poverty and inequality. Its key mobilisation   moments were around the United Nations (UN) Financing for Development (FDD) Summit in July, the UN   General Assembly (UNGA) in September and the UN Climate Change Conference (also known as COP21)   in December. The campaigns three key objectives were to 1) increase public awareness of the risks and   opportunities of 2015, 2) inspire the public to take action and 3) build a stronger civil society movement.   This evaluation finds that the campaign was most successful in achieving its third objective, and relatively   successful in reaching its first and second objectives.     Engagement and objectives: Engagement with the campaign among participating organisations was   high and of a positive nature. The campaigns key objectives were well understood and supported by   participating organisations and others that were involved with the campaign. Understanding of the   campaign model was lower, especially on responsibilities at a national level and among those further away   from its central governance structure. The campaign included a wide variety of actors on a global, national   and local level, many of whom had existing networks and supporter bases, and with varying experience of   campaigning methods.     Campaign design, structure and messaging: The overall design of the campaign and the use of the   flotilla structure were fit for purpose, given the objectives of the campaign focused on public mobilisation.   Its opt-in structure inspired enthusiasm and creativity. The campaign structure could have been more   effective with increasingly localised messaging, improved regional coordination and central campaigning   capacity around fundraising and communications at a global level.     Campaign delivery and coordination: The global coordination of action/2015 was effective. Delivery of   the campaign was strongly dependent on national participating organisations capabilities. Action/2015   funding enabled participation but was often insufficient. Many participating organisations brought   additional funding to the campaign outside of the central budget, mostly through contributing own   resources (some of them in-kind contributions), some through additional funds for mobilisation activities.   The multitude of mobilisation events and campaign moments resulted in high engagement but also in   some campaign fatigue and logistical challenges.     Impact on raising awareness and mobilising the public: Raising awareness of the risks and opportunities   of 2015 and mobilising the public was relatively successful. Large numbers of participating organisations   and citizens were mobilised around key moments. Traditional and social media played an important role in   awareness of the campaign.     Impact on building stronger civil society movement: The most important outcome of the campaign   was building a stronger global civil society movement, creating stronger networks between civil society   organisations (CSOs) and increasing skills of local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). This is the most   valuable outcome of action/2015 to protect in the future.     Impact on policy making: For many who took part in the campaign, the absence of influencing decision   makers as a key objective was a major weakness of action/2015. It is clear that a campaign of the scope and   breadth of action/2015 faced trade-offs and the focus on mobilisation was a deliberate characteristic and   reason for the campaigns success. Although it was not a key objective of the campaign, action/2015 did   have some influence on policy makers, mostly on a global and local level.     Future: There is no clear follow-up strategy for the campaign, and there is a risk that the momentum and   relationships built during the year will not be utilised optimally. The level of enthusiasm for continued   cooperation among participating organisations is very high. There is consensus that the action/2015 brand   and campaign should not be extended, but diverging ideas on possible future directions.          conclusions     In many ways, action/2015 was a transitional campaign. It can be seen as both the last of an old   generation of global campaigns and the first of a new generation. It looked to the future in being strongly   rooted in the Global South. It was collaborative, inclusive and owned by its participating organisations, but   was still initiated and funded by Northern groups.     The campaign met the expectations of participating organisations. It showed that with a limited   amount of central funding it is possible to meaningfully inspire civil society across the world.     The key impact of the campaign was that global civil society groups learned how to work together.     Action/2015 laid the groundwork for long-term impact, especially in terms of connecting national   agendas and government policy to global frameworks, and inspiring a new generation of activists. It   demonstrated there is real public constituency for the SDGs.     Action/2015 took meaningful steps towards Southern ownership of a global campaign. It also created   a space for climate and development groups to work together.     Overall, design and structure of the campaign were fit for purpose. The campaign showed benefits of   leveraging resources through partnerships, networks and coalitions and of campaigning under one global   brand. The most important feedback on campaign design was that it needed greater localisation, but to   some extent this reflected local capacity to adapt global resources. Participating organisations tested new   tools and approaches to engage communities.     Globally, the campaign did not engage with non-NGO civil society actors, such as faith groups and   trades union, as successfully as it could have done.     recommenDations for members of the action/2015 coalition     1. Members of action/2015 should keep the network alive. It has created a platform for   organisations to collaborate, rather than a single global movement of individual citizens. It has   created real local mobilisation capacity in new places. There needs to be infrastructure for on-going   knowledge sharing, coordination and planning, carrying forward the objectives and Southern led   ownership of the campaign and building on the enthusiasm to work together.   2. Members of action/2015 should identify and plan for moments to come together as a global   network. These could have a thematic focus or could be linked to key mobilisation moments from   the 2015 campaigning year. These moments should have a forward calendar where key moments   will be identified. The coalition needs to think about how these moments will be resourced and   coordinated.   3. Campaigners should consider how they will hold their governments to account. National   governments made real commitments in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris. Members of the   coalition should connect national policy and performance to these commitments, and consider   them in a local context. This will require a focus on policy monitoring and evaluation, gathering   data on implementation and moments to hold governments to account.   4. The coalition should keep building an inclusive network. It should explore broadening the   network to include those civil society actors that were not part of the original campaign, and invest   in existing relationships between participating organisations.        recommenDations for future global campaigns     1. Global campaigns should focus on mobilisation over policy when the objective is   demonstrating broad public pressure for political change. It is an inclusive approach that   requires wide participation and high-level messaging. The trade offs are accountability, specificity   and a limited call to action. The decentralised flotilla is an appropriate model for certain types of   campaigning. It may prove challenging for this model to accommodate more detailed policy and   advocacy work without creative thinking about new approaches.   2. Global campaigns in the future will be most effective when they can connect across issues,   and empower new voices. They must be led by a diverse set of actors rooted in the Global South.   Action/2015 was transitional in the sense that it marked an important step on this journey. The next   generation of global campaigning should build on its achievements. This implies that NGOs and   their funders need to continue to reflect on their fundamental role in society, how they represent   power, their legitimacy and added value.   3. Global campaigns should be as inclusive as possible, and prioritise this early on in the   campaign design. Meaningful coalition building happens when a campaign includes a wide   spectrum of non-NGO civil society actors. There should be more creative thinking about engaging   with other actors such as the private sector, trade unions, faith movements and regional platforms.   The emergence of social enterprises, B Corps, mutual organisations and co-operatives shows that   the line between the private sector and civil society is increasingly opaque.   4. Internally, there may be value in under-promising and over-delivering when planning,   designing and communicating coalitions. It created the space for people in national campaigns   to set their own expectations. This may not always be appropriate for external communications,   but it is an area worth further consideration.   lessons learneD     Decentralise but with central capacity: allow opting-in for partners and participating organisations but   ensure capacity at a global level     The more local the better: use local languages, faces, issues and wording as much as possible to ensure   the campaign links to the local everyday reality     Build on existing structures: leverage the strength of existing networks and relationships. Actively seek     out opportunities to identify and use these networks   Invest in national coalitions: Strong national coalitions can increase impact and reach. Leveraging   networks, a strong coordinator, involving youth and funding are important in building a coalition     Plan, plan, plan and reflect: start planning early and ensure there is time to reflect and learn from past   activities     Consider trade-offs in messaging: consider trade-offs between high level messaging and specific,     targeted messaging, and how this affects the diversity of participants and impact   A united civil society is influential: because it is able to speak with one voice and because between local,   national, regional and global networks it has a tremendous reach     Evaluation is information: monitor and track consistently across countries and use systems for sharing     success stories   Early engagement and wide engagement makes a difference: include a wide variety of actors early on in   the process to design a truly global, inclusive and decentralised campaign     Mobilisation is a means, political change is the end: the ultimate and only way to real change is   influencing policy makers and decision makers, and mobilisation should be in service of this          1. INTROdUCTION TO ThIS EVALUATION   1.1 BackgrounD anD oBjectives   Action/2015 was a global coalition that came together united by the belief that 2015 was a critical year for   progress in the fight against climate change, poverty and inequality.     The key objectives of the coalition were to:     1. Increase public awareness of the opportunities and risks of 2015   2. Inspire the public to take action through mobilisation activities   3. Build a stronger movement of civil society organisations (CSOs)   With key mobilisation activities around the United Nations Financing for Development summit in July, the   UN General Assembly in September, the UN Climate Change Conference in December and other activities   throughout the year, action/2015 completed its agreed schedule of campaigning activity in December.     This evaluation was commissioned in November 2015, with the following key objectives:        Present   a   high   level   overview   of   action/2015,   of what happened during the campaign and   what it comprised of in terms of structure, key mobilisation activities, (social) media presence and   finances     Assess   effectiveness,   efficiency   and   relevance   of   the   campaign in terms of campaign design,   planning, implementation, principles and procedures, capacity and quality of the day-to-day   management of the campaign   Assess   impact   and   outcomes   of   the   campaign   with regards to the key objectives of the   campaign of increasing public awareness, inspiring the public to take action through mobilisation   activities and increasing coordination and cooperation between CSOs, as well as assessing the   campaigns impact on policy making     Synthesise   lessons   learned   and   present   key   recommendations   of the campaign to identify best   practices and inform future CSO coordination mechanisms   1.2 introDuction   This evaluation reviews the design, effectiveness and outcomes of the action/2015 campaign. Following the   Terms of Reference, which are included in the Appendix of this report, it assesses the campaign against its   key objectives. The report consists of the following chapters outlined below.     presents a high-level overview of the campaign, discussing the historical context in   which the campaign was established, its founding meetings and documents, its structure, key   mobilisation moments, key (social) media statistics and the high level financing of the campaign.      Chapter   3   analyses involvement with and perceptions of the campaign. It presents an overview   of stakeholders engagement with the campaign and ambitions and objectives for action/2015. It   considers the campaigns relationship to partners and external actors. It discusses action/2015s   flotilla structure and the actors that were involved with the campaign.      Chapter   4 reviews the design and delivery of the campaign, assessing its effectiveness, efficiency   and relevance. It covers the initial campaign design, structure, cooperation and functioning of   different bodies and how the campaign linked to local contexts. It assesses key themes and the   scope of action/2015 messaging. It also includes an assessment of delivery and coordination of   the campaign, in terms of planning and coordination, execution of mobilisation activities and   campaign resources. Lastly, this chapter will comment on financing and the sub grant system.      INTRODUCTION TO THIS EVALUATION        Chapter   5   assesses the impact and outcomes of the campaign. It considers overall impact,   followed by the campaigns performance against its three key objectives. Chapter 5.3 analyses   impact on increased public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015, public awareness of   the campaign and endorsement of its objectives. Chapter 5.4 discusses impact through inspiring   the public to take action, analysing key mobilisation events and activities. Chapter 5.5 analyses   impact on action/2015s third objective of building a stronger civil society movement. It discusses   how action/2015 created a space for civil society to work together, and how it increased local skills   and capacity. Lastly, Chapter 5.6 examines the extent to which action/2015 had any impact on   influencing policy and decision-makers, and whether this should have been a stronger focus.      Chapter   6 is concerned with the future and follow-up to action/2015, discussing stakeholders   views on next steps now the campaigns activities have formally come to an end and how it   planned and could have prepared for the future.      Chapter   7   consists of conclusions, recommendations and lessons learned both for the participants   in the coalition, and for those who seek to mobilise similar coalitions in the future.   1.3 approach   This evaluation of the action/2015 campaign comprised of a series of activities to evaluate the outcomes   and effectiveness of the campaign, namely:        A   review   of   action/2015   documentation   and   data      Qualitative   interviews   with   36 stakeholders from the different action/2015 governing bodies,   participating organisations and external organisations      A   quantitative   survey   completed   by   160 respondents, directed at participating organisations but   open to anyone who was involved with action/2015   A detailed description of the approach for this evaluation, including information on the documentation and   data that was analysed can be found in the Appendix (Chapter 8.2). It includes details on the reach and sample   of stakeholders for the qualitative interviews and the quantitative survey. The Appendix also includes a   section on comments and limitations on the process.          2   2.1 introDuction   This chapter presents a high level overview of the features of the action/2015 campaign, the context that it   was developed in, its key mobilisation moments, media profile and financing. All graphs and charts in this   chapter are based on information provided by the coalition.     2.2 context   A number of civil society groups and partners identified the year 2015 as a potentially important year for   global campaigning.     The primary reason was that 2015 marked the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and   the launch of their successor framework, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, the United   Nations Climate Change Conference took place in November/December 2015.     This created an opportunity to connect issues and campaigns under a broad umbrella campaign.   2015s most obvious corollary is with 2005, where the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in July focussed on Africa   and climate, and was followed in December by a WTO meeting on global trade. Campaigning around   this year became known as the Make Poverty History (MPH) campaign, and was largely focussed on   governments in the Global North. It included many of the actors who would become key participants in   action/2015.     In the period between 2005 and 2015, there were a number of other global campaigning moments, and   there were significant changes in the global landscape.     Many of those interviewed for this evaluation shared their analyses of these changes, which are beyond the   scope of this report, but there was wide consensus that global campaigning in 2015 and beyond had to   operate under a new model.     The old model of change of global campaigns was largely Northern led and dominated by international   NGOs. The Theory of Change of these campaigns was aimed at influencing global targets and Northern   governments and its messaging was top down and centralised.     The new model of campaigning aims to be networked, bottom up and decentralised. It is focused on   Southern leadership and ownership, and on including organisations across the Global South to take on   leading roles in the design and planning of the campaign.     Action/2015 was a transitional campaign that deliberately sought to establish this new model for global   campaigning. It was designed to be Southern-led, inclusive and to put the ownership of the campaign   into the hands of local and national networks. It sought to build a broad membership base, that linked   together issues of poverty, inequality and climate. This determined the structure, design and delivery of the   campaign.     2.3 initial meetings anD founDing Documents   Action/2015 was founded after a number of initial, informal meetings between key organisations in global   development, climate, poverty and other areas related to its key campaign objectives.     These meetings were attended by a core group of international non-governmental organisations (INGOs)   from a variety of countries, including Save the Children (STC), ONE, Climate Action Network, Global Call to   Action Against Poverty (GCAP), Oxfam, the UN Foundation, CIVICUS, Beyond 2015 and many other (I)NGOs.   The initial meetings were attended by many of the same groups, but throughout the campaign new actors          became involved, and others worked on a distance from action/2015. In these meetings, the outline of the   campaign was shaped, designed and refined.     There are different perspectives on what can be considered the first meeting on action/2015, and at which   stage decisions were made that shaped the campaign model. Chapter 4.2 of this report, on the initial design   of the campaign, discusses the mixed opinions of stakeholders about these meetings.     The Istanbul Communiqué, coming out of the meeting in Istanbul in February 2014, was a statement of   principles signed by 80 organisations, including large NGOs like Save the Children, ONE and GCAP. It is   generally considered the founding document of action/2015 and describes its purpose, approach and   relevance.     The graphic below shows the key points and outcomes from each meeting.     Initial meetings timeline     2014 2015  Nairobi  February 2014        First meeting with formal   conversations about the design   and setup of the campaign      The initial shape and design of   the campaign was developed in   broad terms. Key conclusions of   the meeting were:      Something should happen   around 2015 and its   negotiations      It should link development   and climate      It should focus on popular   mobilisation      Around 40 organisations took   part in this meeting   Istanbul  February 2014        During this meeting the coalition agreed   on the founding principles for   action/2015, documented in the Istanbul   Communiqué      It was a crucial meeting in deciding the   direction of the campaign, stakeholder   engagement and its role towards external   partners.      Around 30 organisations took part in this   meeting, approximately half had also   attended the Nairobi meeting      Some organisations that had previously   been involved left the campaign at this   point   Johannesburg  April 2014        The key outcome of this meeting was the   campaign outline. It established the   structure, visual identity guidelines and   the timeline of key campaign mobilisation   moments   General Assembly, Johannesburg    November 2014        The key outcome of this Assembly was the   overall messaging of the campaign and   agreement on the timeline of key   mobilisation moments   General Assembly, Tunis    March 2015        The key outcome of this   Assembly was agreement on   the strategy and campaign   tactics for key mobilisation   moments      The Assembly provided an   opportunity to reflect on the   launch and campaign   moments so far, to share plans   and best practices for   upcoming mobilisations and   decide on next steps     2.4 action/2015 structure anD participating organisations   Around 40 organisations took part in the first meeting in Nairobi. By the end of the campaign, Action/2015   had become a movement of more than 2,200 organisations, and included networks and coalitions in 157   countries, with more than 80% of participating organisations located in the Global South.     The campaign was an explicit objective to bring together campaigners from development, environmental   and rights-based organisations.     Participating organisations came from diverse backgrounds, working on a range of issues including peace   and development, environment, climate, education, civil rights, youth, rural development, social business,   media development, elderly, health, renewable energy and more. They ranged from very small CSOs   working in rural areas with their communities and constituents, to major international NGOs.              The majority of participating organisations were traditional NGOs. Whilst there was more organisational   diversity and cross-sector relationships in some national coalitions, there was only limited wider   participation from other civil society actors, such as faith groups and trade unions.     The campaign was deliberately set up to be flexible and adaptable. Its core principles were to be inclusive,   enabling, light touch and open source, drawing on the strengths and resources of its participating   organisations.     The campaign consisted of the following governance bodies.     The terms national coordinator and national coalition lead were used interchangeably by stakeholders.   Throughout this report we use the term national coalition lead.              Connect regional to national and global   levels         2.5 key moBilisation moments   Globally, action/2015 reports there were over 31 million actions in over 100 countries in support of   action/2015. Action/2015 used a broad definition of actions, and mobilisation moments consisted of   a wide variety of activities with different amounts of individuals mobilised. These activities included   demonstrations, marches, community events, petitions, workshops, high-level panels, street bashes,   postcard actions and many more.     The timeline below gives an overview of key action/2015 moments throughout the year. This is a high level   overview of the main centrally co-ordinated activities, as the campaign was made up of a range of activities   and initiatives around the world.     2.6 key meDia anD social meDia statistics   Action/2015 achieved broad coverage on both traditional and social media (which mainly included Twitter   and Facebook). Action/2015s media impact is analysed in more detail in Chapter 5.     It is important to note that media monitoring was not centralised and while in some countries the data   offers a very accurate picture, in other countries it was not comprehensive or not a good representation of   impressions, views or mentions.          The case studies illustrate action/2015s media profile in selected countries, and provide examples of   partnerships and how action/2015 was featured in the media on a national level.         2.7 finances   Central income and expenditure     Action/2015 was a decentralised campaign, with a central budget of a little over $2.5m.     The majority of this funding was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), with the   balance coming from a small number of large INGOs. 60% of these funds were regranted through subgrants,   administered by the Global Hub to participating organisations to coordinate, resource and deliver   mobilisation activities. The remaining budget of around $1m was allocated for global coordination.   This consisted of travel and salaries for the Global Hub and regional coordinators (16.5% of total spend),   meetings and general Assemblies (11.5%), indirect costs to host organisation CIVICUS (7%) and global   communications and campaign materials (2%).     It is important to note this budget does not represent the total investment made in action/2015 by all   involved. One key characteristic of the campaign is that it unlocked a large amount of additional funding,   with participating organisations raising targeted funds and investing their own resources. In addition,   significant in-kind investments of expertise and time were made by participating organisations and others   involved in the campaign. This contribution of resources played an important role in leveraging existing   resources and increased the reach and impact of the campaign significantly.     As there is no central accounting of all this investment, it is not possible to estimate the total cost of the   campaign. As discussed in Chapter 4.5, this is in part due to the decentralised nature of the campaign,   causing barriers to a central overview and monitoring system.     The total cost and spend of the campaign are, however, likely to be an order of magnitude much greater   than the central budget.     Sub-grants system     The sub-grants that were administered to participating organisations were allocated through a grant   selection process. Participating organisations were encouraged to apply in coalitions. Funds could be used   for campaign activities or supplies (materials and resources to implement events), staff costs, transportation   and national campaign building activities (meetings). Participating organisations filled out a proposal in   which they were asked to demonstrate a fit with the overall grant focus, proven commitment and capacity   to mobilise, an implementation, budget and Monitoring and Evaluation plan and the ability to work in   partnerships. The Sub-Grant Selection Committee of the respective region then reviewed the proposals   against a scorecard. This committee consisted of 5 people: a representative from the Reference Group, the   funding action team, the regional coordinator and 2 representatives of the action teams working on the   mobilisation moment concerned. The name of the sub-grants recipients were released publicly.     The sub-grants were delivered in three rounds; the table below presents an overview of the different   rounds. The average amount of grants received per proposal was $9,244.

Aligned with the objectives of delivering a campaign that is strongly rooted in the Global South, it   shows that countries receiving most sub-grants are located in Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America.     Global distribution of sub-grants     3 INVOLVEMENT wITh ANd PERCEPTIONS Of ThE CAMPAIGN     3.1 introDuction   This chapter discusses stakeholders engagement with the campaign, perceptions, objectives and   expectations.     Action/2015 engaged with a large variety of stakeholders, from global, high level stakeholders from   governance bodies, the UN or national development agencies to grassroots organisations working across   the world. Stakeholders engaged with the campaign on different levels, were from different backgrounds   and geographic locations around the world.     This diversity of backgrounds and opinions has given the evaluation a diverse and dynamic view of the   strengths and weaknesses, the outcomes, effectiveness and relevance of the campaign on different levels.   Overall there was a high level of involvement with the evaluation, indicating that stakeholders are keen to   support the campaign in reviewing its effectiveness and relevance, give feedback and share their lessons   learned.     3.2 involvement With anD unDerstanDing of the campaign   The level of understanding of the campaign and its goals and objectives was relatively high and consistent,   and most peoples views of the objectives of the campaign were aligned with the formal objectives.   In contrast, understanding of the campaign model, including its structure and stakeholders role in the   campaign varied to a larger extent. While most had a clear understanding of the different governance   bodies of the campaign some (especially those working on a local level) indicated that roles and   responsibilities, especially of national coalition leads, were not always clear.     Stakeholders also spent very different proportions of time on the campaign. Some only dedicated around   10% of their daily activities to the campaign, whereas others were working on it full time. 51% of survey   respondents answered that some of their work covered the action/2015 campaign, whilst 37% answered   they were working mostly on action/2015. Members of the Global Hub and regional coordinators all   worked on the campaign full-time. Members of the Reference Group and global action teams varied in   their engagement. Most reported peak moments of time spent around key mobilisation moments, and a   few noted the launch and setup phase were very intensive. Most worked on the campaign more than they   initially expected, but this did not limit their enthusiasm around taking part.     I was the lead person in terms of designing the campaign in [my country].. One of our mandates was   building a coalition, so we had many CSOs to bring together.. I spent 100% of my time on action/2015, I was   basically action/2015 campaign manager for [my organisation].     Governance stakeholder, Africa     National coalition leads also reported very different numbers of hours spent on the campaign. Some   participating organisations found it difficult to identify how much time they spent on action/2015   specifically, because they organised activities that were linked to action/2015 but were also part of the core   work for their own organisation. A high number of stakeholders mentioned that they would have liked to   become involved with the campaign earlier, and that this could have improved their contribution and its   effectiveness.     Something that was notable during the campaign is that people developed strong relationships and   enjoyed working together; there was a positive atmosphere around participating in the campaign, sharing   views and cooperating. Some stakeholders mentioned that in previous campaigns they had worked on   there was a stronger sense of competition between participating organisations, partners and stakeholders.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     I have previously participated in other campaigns ... This one I thought was about inclusiveness. Everything   matters to everybody. Although what brought us together were the SDG processes, everything else can be   involved.     Participating organisation, Africa     Based on stakeholders views, we suggest a number of possible reasons for this. Firstly, the campaign   consisted of a coalition of the willing, and actors that did not support the campaign did not take part,   resulting in a positive, supportive membership of the campaign. Secondly, expectations for the campaign   appeared to be relatively low, especially among those in central coordination roles that were involved in   early phases of campaign design. Those stakeholders saw the campaign as an important step towards   Southern mobilisation and ownership, but most expressed to be unsure of the outcomes and specific   results they expected the campaign to have. Since the campaign was so wide spread and had high-level   objectives, most organisations did not have key targets or competitive outcomes to meet, resulting in a   cooperative and flexible approach to the campaign. Finally, as discussed in other parts of this report, the   campaign did not have any specific policy asks, which often cause internal disagreement among partners in   a large campaign. It is not possible to be definitive about which of these made the greatest contribution to   the apparent harmony of the action/2015 coalition.     3.3 amBitions anD oBjectives for the campaign   Stakeholders at the global level and close to the central governance of the campaign expressed relatively   low expectations for action/2015. Taking into account the limited amount of centrally allocated money, they   saw the campaign mostly as a platform for Southern mobilisation providing opportunities to learn lessons   about civil society coordination and the role of public pressure. Those working on the campaign at a local   and national level generally had higher expectations for the campaign, and 80% of survey respondents to   the survey indicates the campaign met their expectations.     The campaign over exceeded my expectations.     I think the objective of action/2015 was trying to relate how decisions on the global level relate to your   everyday life. That there are global decisions that can and will impact peoples life.     Participating organisation, Latin America        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     We wanted the campaign to be able to, across the world, make leaders know and other stakeholders aware   of the fact that this [year] was terribly important. There was thought behind it and there were expectations   about ambitious outcomes. That was really what we hoped that the campaign would be able to do: have   people taking actions, popular campaigning and collating that to showcase that around the world, this is   whats happening and that theres this ground swell demanding ambitious action.     External stakeholder, global     There were three aims: Can we engage people in 2015? Can we have a positive impact on policy? Can we   learn to work together? Of these, the third one was the one that we were really into.     Governance stakeholder, global     The issue that stakeholders differed upon most was whether the campaign was and should have been set   up to influence policymaking. Some stakeholders from participating organisations expressed that only as   the campaign progressed did they come to understand that advocacy, and engaging with policy-makers,   was not among the core objectives of the campaign.     The understanding of to what extent influencing policy was part of the campaign was strongest with   global stakeholders close to the central governance of the campaign, and weaker amongst participating   organisations and those further away from central governance .     In smaller, national organisations where the person responsible for advocacy was the same person that   handles mobilisation efforts there was often a lack of such distinction, and mobilisation efforts were   combined with policy work at a local level.     We recognised that this was a moment of broad policy asks. Could we say that people cared about these   issues and wanted government action on it? Could we pull that off? Our analysis was that what was lacking   on both the COP21 and the SDGs was political will, not policy content. But everyone loves policy. My view was   that in moments of such breadth, because the gap is one of political will, the right thing to do was focus on   mobilising the public.     Governance stakeholder, global     The priorities for different countries were incredibly diverse. Many indicated their national priorities were   similar to the objectives outlined above. Other priorities that were identified by more than one stakeholder   or survey respondent were:        Those issues mentioned by individual stakeholders or survey respondents included anti- corruption,   technology transfer, child protection, transportation and water sanitation.     Few stakeholders indicated planned regional priorities, and it appeared there were not many deliberate   efforts to link priorities of countries within same region.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     The main benefits and reasons that participating organisations outlined for taking part in action/2015 were:         Most of the organisations working in the field are not doing advocacy. My role as a coordinator is to bring   the messages from the local actors, build a message from their experience, and bring it towards the national   and global level. And action/2015 fitted really well with that.     Participating organisation, Latin America     The main reason we got involved is because it is a unique campaign. It links global to local, and it aims at   mobilising citizens. This was unique meaning that we usually target policy makers, but this was more about   masses, numbers, reaching out to everybody. And that attracted me. It was something different.     Participating organisation, Africa     3.4 WiDer stakeholDers connection With the campaign   The variety of stakeholders and organisations that engaged with action/2015 had very different   relationships to the campaign. Some organisations that were involved in or connected to the campaign   had different levels of visibility to other campaign partners, and views on these organisations participation,   contribution and role in the campaign was mixed.     A number of relevant organisations did not take part in the campaign, and some organisations that took   part played a smaller role than expected. A small number of stakeholders from these organisations took   part in this evaluation, and we have been able to include views of these organisations to some extent.   A couple of stakeholders mentioned that the fact that faith movements, trade unions and some of the big   INGOs did not commit to the campaign on a global level was a major weakness. Some of these actors did   take part in the campaign on a national level.     Based on stakeholders views, there are a number of suggested reasons for why these organisations decided   not to take part. Firstly, the dominance of a few organisations in the design and messaging of the campaign   resulted in an early focus on development, potentially alienating global civil society organisations from   other fields. Others noted that climate-focussed organisations had less capacity and capability to take a   leading role in a global mobilisation. For some, the lack of policy engagement or clear policy objectives   was a reason not to engage with the campaign. Others suggested that 2015 was not a moment for a global   coalition, and was more about specific policy asks. Additionally, the lack of awareness of action/2015   at early stages and having many activities for the SDG and COP21 agenda already planned under an   organisations own brand could have resulted in limited reasons to engage with action/2015.     It is also important to consider the impact that closer engagement with the private sector would have on   the relationship with social movements and, to a certain extent, with climate groups, particularly those that   have strong views on the private sectors role in climate change.        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     Certain NGOs, such as Action Aid, were not participating. It would be much stronger if the INGOs would   work together. I think this is due to politics or maybe they had own campaigns already. There is institutional   competition between Save the Children and Oxfam, but Oxfam affiliates participated in some countries, for   example Kenya and Italy.     Governance stakeholder, global     The climate leadership was a clear strategic gap that we recognised and tried to fix it, but I didnt feel we   could wait to find the right person. As a result, it felt led by the development sector, and in particular by Save   the Children. Some of the other big INGOs didnt engage. They focussed on their own stuff.     Governance stakeholder, global     Organisers of action/2015 often described it as a flotilla1, a loose and broad structure that allowed   organisations to engage at key moments and demonstrate broad political support without formally   reconciling multiple policy perspectives and theories of change.     The flotilla structure allowed global and local campaigners to participate on their own terms. For a number   of those in attendance, the Istanbul meeting was where the boundaries for participating began to be   drawn.     The meeting and the Istanbul Communiqué as its most important outcome were a trigger for some of   the more radical, grassroots organisations to step back from the coalition. At the same time, those who   subsequently became involved in Project Everyone, with its close partnership with the United Nations, focus   on communications and making the goals famous, recognised they would be more effective pursuing a   complementary, but separate strategy to action/2015.     Participants in the flotilla     Despite this, the campaign was made up of participating organisations from a range of campaign priorities,   representing both local and global perspectives, and both more-insider and more-outsider models of   change. This included some large organisations that had not taken part in a global campaign before.     1 A campaigning structure whereby groups agree on broad objectives and coordinate loosely around tactics but keep their own brand and do not create   strong coordination structures. In: Cox, B. (2011) Campaigning for International Justice        INVOLVEMENT WITH AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE CAMPAIGN     We started to bring together development, rights and environmental movements. We made significant   advances on that. [members of the] Climate Action Network, Amnesty, Avaaz, World Vision were all part of   the same campaign. That was important, but it didnt go far enough.     Governance stakeholder, global     Action/2015s relationship with participating organisations and other partners is further explored in Chapter     5.4 of this report.   Action/2015s relationship with Project Everyone was mostly visible to stakeholders at the global level.   A number of stakeholders were able to comment on this relationship and they had various opinions on   the process whereby action/2015 and Project Everyone were established as separate organisations and   whether this was the right way. Most agreed that the division of tasks that eventually emerged worked well   and that despite very different ways of working, relationships between the two groups were positive and   constructive. Project Everyone took up the marketing, communications and corporate side of promoting   the Global Goals and creating assets. These assets were then distributed through different channels   including action/2105, this distribution was rolled out mostly through joint global partners.     Action2015 was probably the most critical vehicle to distributing Project Everyone assets to civil society   across the world.      Most stakeholders expressed their understanding of the fact that action/2015 and Project Everyone had   different priorities, but suggested both could have benefited from increased cooperation.     For a number involved in the early formation of the coalition, officials from the United Nations were central   to both the formation of the campaign, and some of its key principles. UN representatives participated in   some of the early meetings, and coalition representatives participated in UN strategy calls. A number of   interviewees reported that key actors within the UN wanted strong civil society activity around the SDGs.   One reason for this was to distinguish them from the MDGs, which were seen as an elite-level process,   rather than a movement with wide popular support.     In general, those close to the centre of the campaign felt the UN relationship was constructive and   represented a new way of working and a new target for mobilisation activity. A small number of   stakeholders in national contexts suggested that action/2015 should have been a more independent   movement.     There were people in the UN system that wanted representatives of civil society there. UN officials wanted   pressure behind the SDGs, because the risk in 2015 was that the SDGs would be all process.     Governance stakeholder, global     The campaign was too aligned with the UN. It should have been an independent civil society movement.     Survey respondent     A few stakeholders indicated that action/2015s engagement with the private sector was limited and should   have been higher, since corporate actors play an important role in defining the SDGs and climate agenda.   Although some countries, as illustrated in the Kenya case study, had engagement with the private sector   on a national level, there was little to no engagement on a global level. A few stakeholders said this was a   missed opportunity.            4.1 introDuction   This chapter covers the design and delivery of the campaign, assessing its effectiveness, efficiency and   relevance. It analyses the structure, messaging and delivery of the campaign and whether it was suitable for   the objectives the campaign set out to deliver.     Overall, this evaluation finds that action/2015s campaign design and delivery were fit for purpose, based on   both qualitative and quantitative feedback.     Survey respondents assessment of campaign design     how appropriate were the following aspects of the campaign for your country?   In this chapter we will elaborate on specific feedback on the structure, messaging and the design of the   campaign, as well as on campaign materials. The chapter consists of the following sections outlined below.     Chapter 4.2 is on the design and structure of the campaign, covering the initial design, campaign structure,   cooperation and functioning of different bodies, and linking of the campaign to local context. Chapter 4.3   on messaging includes key themes and the scope of action/2015 messaging. Chapter 4.4 is on delivery and   coordination of the campaign, including planning and coordination, execution of mobilisation activities   and campaign resources. Chapter 5.5 discusses feedback on funding and the sub-grants system.     4.2 Design anD structure of the campaign   The initial design of the campaign     As outlined in Chapter 2 the action/2015 campaign was designed in a number of high-level meetings by a   group of key actors. Several of those involved as this stage reported that the early phases of planning and   campaign design were not inclusive. Some felt that the campaign was dominated by a few actors (with Save   the Children UK most often mentioned).          A number of stakeholders expressed their frustration with these early meetings. They report that the   dominant members present took charge of decisions and the campaign narrative. Others expressed their   frustration with not being invited at all. One stakeholder mentioned that international development   organisations were overrepresented in these early meetings, thereby having a strong impact on the   language and wording of the campaign. Another reported that attempts to engage climate groups in this   early stage were made, but strong leaders had not been found.     In contrast, most reported that the later stages of campaign planning were more inclusive. Many added that   while Save the Children was dominant in the planning phase, it was less so in later stages and played a very   important role in delivering and coordinating the campaign.     Several commented that starting to plan earlier for the design and development of a campaign that spans a   full year could have improved its effectiveness and impact.     Stakeholders had strong and divergent views on whether the campaign should have had an increased focus   on policy makers. Whether the design of the campaign was fit for influencing policy making is discussed in   this chapter, as well as in Chapter 5.6 of this report.     Structure of the campaign     One of the biggest strengths of the campaign that was mentioned by almost all stakeholders was its   opt-in structure. The flexibility of the campaign, enabling everyone to take out what most fits their cause   and organisation, worked extremely well and was appreciated by all parties. The flotilla structure was   considered a good model for the campaign and a big part of its success. A few commented that the   loose structure made it difficult to secure long-term commitment and did not stimulate partners to take   responsibility beyond the own organisation.     The flotilla model was a double-edged sword. It enabled organisations to drop in and out, they werent   tied in for the whole year. Some stayed and others came in and out. This was a real strength but it was hard   to get people to take on leadership roles.     Governance stakeholder, Europe     The flexible, collaborative structure of the campaign allowed participating organisations to use their own   ideas and creativity and to learn from each other.     Being given high-level objectives, resources and guidelines while having the freedom to link it to issues,   audiences or activities most relevant to their own organisations worked well and inspired enthusiasm and   cooperation.     It gave Southern organisations capacity, resources, communications products and good reasons to work   together at a national level. It meant they didnt have to sign up to a whole platform of issues.     Governance stakeholder, global     Our participation in action/2015 is better and more intense [than in previous campaigns] because   materials, resources, how to do it documents and funding was made available. You are more motivated   because you see reports, pictures and videos from other regions streaming in. And the coordination from the   action/2015 team is superb.     Survey respondent          A few stakeholders at the global level commented on the limited capacity for basic centrally coordinated   campaign functions, such as fundraising and communications. This was considered a weakness of the   campaign and something that could have improved its overall effectiveness. Some expressed there was a   need for stronger coordination on these areas, as they are key enablers of a successful campaign. However,   adding these functions would have added significant coordination costs and made the organisation move   more slowly.     Coordination at a regional level was considered weaker, particularly in the case of Africa. Some stakeholders   called for stronger regional coordination, believing it could have had a big impact on outcomes and   effectiveness. In the case of the FFD summit this could have been an important opportunity to promote   regional priorities and coordinate regionally, but no such coordination happened.     What I think we could have done much better is at the regional level. For example, the African Union   Commission are critical in pushing African voices at a global level ... We didnt have specific plans to engage   them. I think one of the proposals we put in for the second round of funding was to do that, but of course   resources are limited. When engaging at regional level you need more resources and coordination. I think we   did lose a bit of an opportunity there.     Participating organisation, Africa     With regards to the regional coordination of Latin America, stakeholders commented that it was difficult   to engage the Caribbean region with the campaign. Some suggested involvement of this region could be   improved if it was considered separate from Latin America, although they questioned whether this was   feasible in practice.     Cooperation and functioning of different bodies     The structure of the different bodies of action/2015 and their role in the campaign was well understood and   broadly considered an effective model for the campaign. Stakeholders were unanimously positive about the   Global Hub. The level of positive feedback on the Global Hub Coordinator was remarkable. One stakeholder   called the Global Hub a dream team and many applauded its commitment, responsiveness, ability to   translate everything in three languages and general ability to build a personal relationship with everyone   and connect action/2015.     The Global Hub took some time to set up, it was a lot of work for very few people. They managed to build a   lot of trust around the campaign and that was crucial for this to work. They played a major role.     Governance stakeholder, global     The feedback on the Reference Group was mixed, from both stakeholders that were members of the   Reference Group themselves as well as from other stakeholders who commented on its effectiveness and   relevance.     A couple suggested that the idea of the Reference Group was good, but that in practice its members were   selected too early and that roles and responsibilities were not clear. Some members of the Group played an   important role, but others were not very active. The Group as a whole could have played a stronger role in   advising, planning for the future and involving their network, thereby potentially increasing involvement   from other large organisations. A few noted that the Reference Group had very competent people in it but   only 5 or 6 of them, depending on the moment, were active at any one time.     Feedback on the global action teams was generally positive, although few stakeholders mentioned them   without prompting. The action teams were seen to play an important role in the development of materials   and engaging particular audiences, such as the youth ambassadors. The action teams that were responsible   for fundraising and communications did not work as efficiently as was required for global coordination of   these important campaigning areas. Some suggested there was the need for stronger, full time coordinators   with clear priorities, to prevent coordinators from having to balance fundraising for action/2015 with          fundraising efforts for their own organisations.   The extent to which the role of a national coalition lead functioned varied significantly per country.   Although stakeholders were generally positive and saw a lead person per country as an important role, the   responsibilities of the coordinator were not clear in some countries. One stakeholder was not aware of the   fact that most countries had a national coordinator. The different roles that national coalition leads fulfilled   can be categorised as:       Sometimes it seemed there was a lack of coordination.. [Organisations in my country] would all do the   same.. It would make sense if each country would have a lead coordinator or organisation that takes things   forward Everybody expected [organisation in my country] to take up this role, but it didnt. We are now   sharing information, but it would have been better if we would have had that from the beginning, so this   coordinator would take the lead and we would have action/2015 [in my country] and we would have one   work plan.     Participating organisation, Africa     Several stakeholders that were able to comment on the role of Save the Children on a global level   suggested that it would have made sense for the London-based action/2015 team of Save the Children to   join the Global Hub or to have more local presence in Africa, Latin America and Asia.     One stakeholder from outside the campaign considered the lack of CEO or central leadership figure in   the action/2015 campaign difficult to engage with. This was a minority view. Others commented on the   absence of a central leadership, but mostly felt that a CEO or a centralised decision-making body was   incompatible with the structure of a decentralised campaign.     Linking of campaign to local context, involvement of participating organisations     Most stakeholders were positive about action/2015s efforts to link the campaign to the local context and   to involve participating organisations in campaign planning. The assessment of whether the campaign   succeeded in making these links work in practice was more critical.     I really appreciated the fact that we were able to adapt the campaign to the national reality. This is the first   time that a campaign is so open for that.     Participating organisation, Latin America          The survey indicates that most participating organisations felt they were involved in the planning of the   campaign in their country.     Campaign planning should have been more participatory and inclusive, according to the majority of those   involved. Many say it should have involved representative organisations earlier and to a much greater   extent. The campaign was generally considered to have much stronger Southern presence and support   than previous campaigns in international development and climate change. However, many of the key   responsibilities and much of the design of the campaign was still managed in or from the Global North.     Action/2015 became a top down campaign These processes are so difficult to manage, but get them   [participating organisations] to design the campaign... That will only happen when 20 of these coalitions are   asked to come together and asked what they want to campaign for, how they want to campaign. Investing   in that process is also very important... If for example Save the Children had said we will ensure that at least   5 of our country heads will sit in the designing of the campaign, it would have been very different. Nothing   against INGOs, but a country director will know this will work in my country.     Governance stakeholder, global     Action/2015 was most effective where it could build on existing coalitions or networks, in countries   where this was possible (such as the Wada Na Todo network in India and GCAP in a number of countries).   Comparing the campaigns effectiveness in different countries shows that building on existing local   structures is one of the key lessons learned from action/2015. Some suggested there were existing networks   that could have been leveraged more in other countries.     I think it worked really well because [the leading organisation in my country] became that central forum..   When action/2015 was launched there was discussion on the national coalition, and it was only fitting that   a national organisation that was already doing such work would take the lead. It worked very well because it   was not a new coalition that was established, but there were already recognised players.     Participating organisation, Asia          Many stakeholders, especially in French and Spanish speaking regions, mentioned the importance of   connecting the campaign to the local context by using the local language as much as possible. Local   partners are much less inclined to take part or be active when materials and communications are in English.   Although action/2015 was praised for its efforts to provide everything in three languages (English, Spanish   That the key themes of the action/2015 campaign were the fight against climate change, poverty and   inequality was understood and supported by all stakeholders. Action/2015 included organisations working   on all three of these issues and many more. It is a key outcome of the campaign that so many organisations   ended up integrating and linking messaging from these three wider themes to their own messaging. This   was most often mentioned in relation to climate change; various organisations that had never participated   in activities or adopted messaging about climate change got involved with action/2015 and included   climate issues in their campaigns and materials.     Some stakeholders mentioned the predominance of international development language in the messaging   and key themes of the campaign, attributing this to the predominance of development organisations in the   initial planning phases.     For some, this created a real obstacle to being involved in the campaign. As they did not agree with the   tone of messaging and the international development angle, one organisation felt that they could not   stand behind the core of the campaign, since communicating in development language could have   adverse affect on the international negotiation processes.     Within the campaign overall the biggest moment, or what was pushed as the biggest moment, was the SDG   summit. Although the campaign is about SDGs and COP21 I think most organisations in the coalitions work   more specifically on development than climate.     Governance stakeholder, global     When considering the connection and overlap between the three key themes of the campaign it is   important to note that linking climate change, poverty and inequality was a significant step in connecting   global challenges. The problems of the world are interconnected, and cannot be seen in silos. The campaign   stimulated thinking about the links and relationships between key international challenges, sectors, themes   and negotiations.     A few suggested that the campaign could have taken even greater steps in doing so.     It [the campaign] is a good aggregator of stories of actions in various parts of the world, therefore giving   spaces for participation and involvement. But it has limited itself to telling the happy stories but not in telling   the sharper narratives of the intrinsic link between human rights and development and environment or   climate change, thus the calls were not as transformative or radical as it should be.     Survey respondent     The scope of action/2015 messaging     The messaging of the action/2015 campaign emerged as a result of its open nature and decentralised   structure. There was a deliberate choice to focus on top line messages rather than detail. The campaign   avoided making campaign messaging directive by targeting specific SDGs, outcomes or issues. These   choices were well understood and supported.          This meant that for many, messaging was easily adaptable and enabled organisations to align it to their   own organisations themes and purposes. For others this was a drawback, as it meant that messaging (as   well as resources, which will be discussed in the next section) was very much framed in a global language   and therefore not always applicable to the local context. Some indicated that terms like sustainable   development or even climate change or inequality mean little to beneficiaries and constituents in rural   communities.     It is very common for ideas to come from the Europe, so the West, from England, which are totally removed   from the realities of countries like mine. For us, for example, it made no sense to ask 15 years olds how   they imagine themselves at 30 because they dont picture themselves at 30. In some zones it is extremely   dangerous here. For some young people, imagining themselves in 15 years is science fiction.     Governance stakeholder, Latin America     These stakeholders suggested that the campaign could have generated more energy and commitment by   focusing on specific issues. On a local level this would provide a clearer link to peoples everyday lives, but   also on a national or global level it would give a clearer call to action.     A few stakeholders expressed their doubts about the concept of action/2015 and elaborated that you   cant really claim a year.They were of the opinion that you can claim a day or an issue, but that a year is not   a feasible or effective framework for a campaign, and that some of the challenges with the delivery and   coordination of the campaign arose from the 1-year structure. Taking into account that the first half-year   consisted of relatively less important mobilisation moments, they suggested that action/2015 could have   been a 6-month campaign from Addis to COP21 with the SDGs in the middle. Others were enthusiastic   about the fact that action/2015 spanned a whole year of activities, because that enabled organisations to   pick and choose the moments that were most relevant for their organisations and constituents.     Overall, stakeholders found that action/2015 had a positive and inclusive narrative and that its themes and   messaging reflected this; it gave guidelines for messaging and then left everyone free to use their creativity   to choose those issues most applicable to the local context. This worked well and inspired cooperation,   sharing and creativity.     It felt that it hung together well. These moments dont come along very often and it felt very focused, the   moment and the communications around it were very good. You can imagine that with 17 goals and all   the arguments about how many goals there were it could have got very messy but somehow it seems that   we had something very clear and strong to communicate to our key audiences, particularly the importance   of getting strong goals and holding governments to account. I think its been a very good clear coherent   campaigning message, throughout the year.     Participating organisation, Europe     One global stakeholder noted that action/2015 was not an easy campaign to build a message structure   around. Not only did it not have a clear call to action, or strong policy content, it was about reasonably   esoteric global processes.     It was not an easy proposition. It was not the strongest call to action, but it didnt feel like there were   compelling alternatives that we missed. Getting people out and excited about UN processes is not the easiest   ask.     Governance stakeholder, global          4.4 Delivery anD coorDination of the campaign   Planning and coordination of the campaign     The majority of stakeholders was positive about the delivery and coordination of the campaign.   Organisations chose moments, activities or messages that were most appropriate for their organisation. This   defined coordination and planning processes to a large extent as it allowed participating groups to connect   action/2015 to their existing campaigning and planning cycles.     Many stakeholders praised action/2015 for the successful delivery of a global campaign of this scope and   breadth.     Its important to remember that one of the things action/2015 was pitched as, at the start of the campaign,   was the idea that you could do what you were already planning to do with the action/2015 brand, as   opposed to creating lots of different activities. There are a number of activities that happened as a result of   action/2015 coordinating or coming together but there are also plenty of activities that have an action/2015   flavour to them because of the way that the campaign was structured. I think that worked well for people   and they found it easier to engage with.     Governance stakeholder, Europe     Action/2015 is the most effective, most massive campaign I've ever been involved in.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Some felt that the volume of mobilisation events was very high, so there was limited space to reflect   upon previous events, or to build up a learning cycle. In some instances, the planning felt rushed and too   much  we were running from one event to the next. On the other hand, participating organisations also   appreciated that they could pick and choose from events linked to their cause and a couple of stakeholders   praised action/2015s ambitious agenda of activities, which offered so many opportunities for mobilisation.   Many commented on the importance of aligning the timing of mobilisation activities with the local context.   In some countries organising a demonstration on a weekday simply does not work, but in other countries   religious or cultural traditions make it difficult to plan events on Saturdays or Sundays.     Best practices from India showed that spreading mobilisation over a few days or a week around the key   mobilisation date(s) worked well, also relieving some of the logistical pressure to organise many activities at   the same time. It is then necessary to ensure that mobilisation is still clearly linked to the global moment /   event, as this is an important part of action/2015s role in connecting local and global issues.     One of the main strengths was bringing together a broad cross section of society around the world, to   mobilise and take action on these moments that were happening throughout the year. Ive never seen that   happen before You could see people from cities like London to really remote villages in say Tanzania all   mobilising on the same day and that was quite incredible.     Governance stakeholder, global     Another issue around coordination was that planning sometimes happened suddenly, and that the   turnaround time for translating or signing off materials was at times short. For example, one stakeholder   cited the press release that came out for International Womens Day that had to be signed off and   distributed in a very short period of time. It was understood that this was also a product of external   circumstances, however, having a timeline that allows for more space would increase the campaigns   effectiveness.     Many stakeholders commended action/2015 for its efforts to provide a high number of contact   moments and opportunities for connecting, and were positive about the frequency and effectiveness of          communication between global, regional and national levels. Governance bodies or individuals such as the   action teams and national coalition leads had regular check in-calls and many participating organisations   had bi-weekly calls with key partners and/or national coalition leads. Most viewed these calls as helpful and   supportive of the planning process.     Sometimes when you are in charge, it helps if people keep reminding you. You dont get left out. It gives you   the morale and the ability to organise as quickly and as soon as possible.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Google Groups were the main tool for online coordination. The groups were generally thought be an   effective way to keep everyone involved and updated on what was happening in the campaign around the   world. A couple of stakeholders stated that the Google Groups provided a great opportunity to connect   with participating organisations around the world (for example to connect with organisations that are   working on the same themes and issues in another region of the world). This led to sharing of ideas,   learning and creating possibly lasting relationships.     Some felt that at times there was an overload of information and emails, especially when the   communications were not collaborative, one stakeholder described this as pushing out of information.   The methods of communication most often mentioned by stakeholders from participating organisations   were email, via the Google Group, Skype, Facebook and Whatsapp.     Execution of mobilisation activities     The execution of mobilisation activities was largely determined by countries national priorities and the   types and backgrounds of participating organisation who coordinated mobilisation activities. In some cases   key partners coordinated general activities and others organised themselves around these, in other cases   participating organisations organised their own activities linking to a specific theme.     Delivery of activities was to a large extent dependent on participating organisations resources and capacity.   Although the sub-grants provided a good platform, and for some organisations were the only reason they   could participate, executing mobilisation activities was dependent on human resources and available   capacity. A number of participating organisations indicated that implementation timelines were sometimes   too short, making it challenging to organise and execute mobilisation activities effectively.     delivery of key mobilisation moments     launch until before   may mobilisation     Strengths:        In this phase the campaign was   still building up and many   participating organisations got   inspired and joined the campaign   during this time      The launch and the send a   postcard to your PM action were   evaluated positively by many and   called a highlight of the campaign   Weaknesses:        Choosing 15 January as a launch   date was arbitrary and it was not   clear to everyone why this was the   date chosen for the launch      In many countries the action/2015   coalition was not yet established,   and coordination of these   activities was therefore somewhat   fragmented. Some indicated that   key moments later in the   campaign worked better   financing for Development     Strengths:        This was the first of the three key   moments of the coalition, and   stakeholders reported a high level   of enthusiasm and engagement.   This is reflected by the high   number of people that were   mobilised for this event      Many African countries linked their   policy work to the FFD summit.   Impact on this was visible, for   example the delegation using   action/2015 wording      FFD generated a high level of   Twitter engagement, especially in   African countries   Weaknesses:        FFD would have been a good   opportunity to present regional   African priorities, but this did not   happen      A majority of exposure in   traditional media (media   mentions) was in the US and not in   African countries   unga     Strengths:        For many the UNGA was the key   moment of the campaign, and   everyone indicated high   engagement      Many stakeholders, especially   respondents to the survey,   indicated that Light the Way was   one of the most successful   elements of the campaign      A number of participating   organisations called out how   special it was to feel part of the   negotiations in New York through   action/2015   Weaknesses:        A minority of global stakeholders   questioned whether Light the   Way should have been a separate   event, indicating that the SDGs/   Global Goals itself were the   message, and that action/2015   shouldn't have sidetracked from   that with Light the Way   cop 21     Strengths:        Many participating organisations   that had not previously worked on   climate engaged with the   campaign and included climate in   their work because of their   activities around the COP   21summit      Some participating organisations   indicated their governments had   limited commitment to COP21   (much less than with UNGA) and   that action/2015 gave them a   reason and the tools to put climate   firmer on the agenda   Weaknesses:        Some indicated that action/2015   could have been more present at   the COP21, and that they expected   higher visibility of the campaign.   This needs to be considered in the   context of the Paris attacks, which   caused some organisations to   change their plans        For every campaign moment, we spent more time on planning and designing the campaign, than providing   anchors and partners with ample time to implement. This has led to tremendous pressures on the local   mobilisers, but we are very happy with the results they've come up with each time.     Survey respondent     The chart below gives an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the planning and delivery of key   mobilisation moments and phases.     International Youth Day, on the 12th of August, was also mentioned as a successful moment of the   campaign by many. The concept around #YouthPower messaging was found to be creative, relevant and   powerful, and the responsiveness and inclusiveness of co-chairs of the Youth action team were a key   strength.     Campaign resources     Most comments on campaign resources came from participating organisations. Responses to the survey   show that 42% found the campaign resources very appropriate, and 36% found them fairly appropriate.   The feedback from Spanish-speaking countries in the interviews and the survey was more critical   than experiences from French and English speaking regions. Although there were several points for   improvement, overall feedback on campaign resources was positive.     They were brilliant at distributing toolkits and being advocates on the ground.     External stakeholder, global     There were diverse opinions on the level to which participating organisations felt they were involved in the   development of campaign materials and the extent to which they were applicable in a local context. Some   said the resources were quite Northern and online focused, making it difficult for communities with limited   internet access to engage.     Others felt that resources used a lot of global language and images, suggesting that materials might   be more useful if, for example, the faces on campaign posters would be localised for different regions.   Others felt it was natural that the supplied materials were global, and they needed to be adjusted to the   local reality. They were generally very happy with the materials provided, and could localise them when   necessary. It is, however, important that materials are supplied in a format that enables editing, which was   not always the case.     Others expressed they were able to adjust materials to the local context, but would have liked some more   guidance on how to do that, especially in the beginning of the year. As the campaign progressed, there was   more sharing of best practices and examples, and this was considered very useful. More detailed feedback   on campaign materials can be found in the case studies in the Appendix.     As was the case with feedback on general planning processes, some noted that campaign materials   sometimes arrived late, not leaving much time for adaptation or translation in local languages.          We experienced the campaign structure, messages and materials as very well prepared and useful. Some   of the messages needed of course to be translated and adapted culturally. Some of the Communication Kits   could perhaps have been sent out a little earlier, due to translation, adjustments and to prepare and engage   the coalition to activity on social media.     Survey Respondent     4.5 funDing of the campaign   Only a limited number of stakeholders were able to comment on the funding and finances of the campaign.   Those that were able to comment on a global level indicated that action/2015 was a successful campaign   relative to the level of central funds available.     As discussed in Chapter 2, one of the key characteristics of the campaign was that it unlocked additional   funding and resources from participating organisations and the total value of the campaign is therefore   much larger than the income and spend of the Global Hub. This was highlighted by a few global level   stakeholders. The lack of a complete financial picture is a necessary consequence of a decentralised   campaign structure. There is a trade-off between the governance of a centralised accounting system   that allows accurate assessments of value for money and more flexible, decentralised approaches that   potentially lever in larger amounts of money for less oversight.     Evaluations typically seek to come to some estimate of value for money. The challenge of estimating value   for money becomes difficult when it is impossible to provide a baseline for total cost. Voluntary reporting   and estimates of spend would partly address this, though we did not test the extent to which there was   enthusiasm or resistance to this.     In practice, the majority of stakeholders we spoke to who had invested in the campaign outside the central   budgets were happy with their levels of investment, and the impact they had achieved with it. The general   impression among most stakeholders was that the coalition did not have a high budget given the ambition   and reach of the campaign, and that, in general, relatively small amounts of money were spent prudently.     Some stakeholders noted that the majority of resources were controlled or allocated by the large   international NGOs, and this raised questions of ownership, power and agency. They felt that resources   and funding were still Northern focused, and that action/2015 could have benefited from a more balanced   division of resources with a stronger focus on the Global South. Some indicated that in order to run a   balanced decentralised campaign it is important to ensure that resources are allocated according to needs.   They felt that if Southern based organisations do not receive the resources to recruit staff or set up systems   needed for full participation at a global campaigning level, the design and creation of campaign strategies   and materials will be dominated by those from the Global North with more resources.     A few stakeholders that were able to assess the role of funders commented that CIVICUS could have been   more involved with the campaign at an earlier stage, seeing that it was chosen because of its position and   expertise in the Global South. Some suggested that the resources of the Save the Children action/2015   team in London should have been based with the Global Hub or in-country, thereby funnelling more   resources to a regional or country level.     A few stakeholders indicated that the global finances of the campaign could be improved. As mentioned   previously, the limited fundraising capacity at a central level was a key challenge. Some felt it was   contradictory for the campaign to rely on participating organisations to raise funds for a central platform.   The limited amount of money available at a central level especially compromised action/2015s   effectiveness around hiring Global Hub staff on time, enabling the planning and payment of sub-grants   properly and to properly finance the COP21 mobilisations.          Sub-grants for participating organisations     Many stakeholders saw the sub-grants system as effective and relevant. It boosted global capacity and   was one of the key reasons for the successful delivery of action/2015 mobilisation activities. Without the   sub-grants, many grassroots organisations would not have had the resources to organise activities and   to develop existing staff members skills or attract new people. CIVICUS was effective in coordinating the   logistics of transferring the sub-grants.     It provided [my organisation] with an international forum and we were given global visibility. It helped my   organisation to expand its network, to develop. If they had not selected us or given us a grant we would have   missed all that  now my people have more experience.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     Many stakeholders mention lack of funds as the key barrier to continued engagement in the future with the   issues action/2015 worked on.     Big campaigns need big money. We were getting small bits and expected to do a lot. We had to put in quite   a lot of our own resources, but I am sure other organisations were not able to do that.     Participating organisation, Africa     A number of stakeholders indicated there were some challenges around the allocation and timings of the   sub-grants. In some cases, participating organisations applied for a grant and were allocated only half of   the amount expected, since the grant was distributed among more partners than anticipated. There was   an understanding that resources need to be given out in a fair and effective way, but this made it hard to   deliver on activities.     Some stakeholders also commented there were more resources available in early funding rounds. A few,   particularly survey respondents, commented that sub-grants were not always given to organisations that   worked most effectively with the resources given. One suggested there could be improved oversight on the   spending of sub-grants.     Sometimes I wondered if there was transparency and equity in resource allocation. Some organisations got   more resources but had very little impact on the ground as compared to those that received less. Next time it   will be good to know who does what and who has the influence.     Survey respondent     Another issue that could be improved was the timing of allocating funding relative to carrying out the   actual activities. For example, sometimes participating organisations would need to wait for a month to   hear whether the bid was approved, and then all activities needed to be delivered in two weeks.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES       5.1 introDuction   In this chapter, we will discuss impact and outcomes of the campaign, assessing how it performed against   the objectives it was set out to deliver. This chapter consists of the following sections.     Chapter 5.2 is on overall impact, discussing high-level outcomes. Chapter 5.3 covers increased public   awareness, including public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015, public awareness of the   campaign and endorsement of its objectives. Chapter 5.4 is on impact through inspiring the public to   take action and mobilisations. Chapter 5.5 is on building a stronger civil society movement, analysing how   action/2015 created a space for CSOs to work together and increase local skills and capacity. And lastly,   chapter 5.6 is on influencing policy as a means of impact.     This chapter on impact is supported by case studies on six countries: India, Kenya, Nigeria, Benin, Mexico   and the United Kingdom. These can be found in the Appendix. In these case studies we identify the key   priorities, organisations, mobilisation moments and lessons learned per country. They provide experiences   from countries that were active participants from the launch of the campaign and where across-sector   partnerships highlight best practices and important lessons learned.     5.2 overall impact   Of its three objectives, action/2015 made the biggest impact in terms of building a stronger civil society   sector. This followed from both qualitative and quantitative data, although this was found stronger in   qualitative interviews than in responses to the survey.       IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Respondents to the survey indicated that action/2015s impact was strongest on their own organisation and   on CSOs in their country.   5.3 increase puBlic aWareness   Raising public awareness was one of the three main objectives of the action/2015 campaign. Key outcomes   to meet this objective were:    This evaluation finds that action/2015 was relatively successful at raising public awareness; quantitative   and qualitative indicators show increased awareness of the opportunities and risks of 2015. It is important   to note this can only in some cases be attributed to action/2015, since many other organisations were   working on these issues. There is substantial evidence of increased campaign visibility and endorsement of   campaign objectives over the course of the year.   Some elements of action/2015 worked particularly well and led to increased impact and awareness of the   campaign. The involvement of young people in particular generated interest and engagement from a wide   range of audiences.   Young people listen to young people and old people listen to young people too.   External stakeholder, global   IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     The strength of action/2015 lies in the fact that the majority of its governance was made up of young   activists. It was the power of youth. There was engagement, dynamism, and determination in the global   governing team and in local teams who implemented the campaign.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     Another factor that played an important role in increasing awareness was the role of social media. In most   regions Twitter was the dominant medium, in Latin America it was Facebook. Twitter was the key tool to   engage new audiences, showcase action/2015 activities and engage constituents and beneficiaries with   the campaign. For some, increased social media presence was an end in itself, and smaller organisations   reported the value of being retweeted by larger organisations or by a large numbers of people.     I have been on Twitter for a while but I have not ever been as active as Ive been this last year. I have learned   a lot from this process. I have gained a lot more followers because I have been active. There are people who   mention or share my tweets. I think it shows the power of communication in campaigns like this.     Participating organisation, Africa     The importance of social media needs to be seen in context, and is often overestimated in developing   countries, especially in Asia. While social media is widespread and has a cross-cutting audience in Northern   countries, internet access and use of social media is less widespread in some developing countries,   especially in rural areas.     The involvement of celebrities in action/2015 was another important aspect of the campaign. The campaign   secured endorsement from a number of international celebrities, most visibly Malala Yousafzai and One   Direction. This generated considerable media interest. It also had a positive effect on commitment to the   campaign; peaks in campaign registration were linked to moments when celebrities were engaging actively   with the campaign, e.g. Malala in December 2014 and One Direction in July / August 2015.     Few stakeholders mentioned celebrity involvement spontaneously or indicated they perceived it as a key   strength of the campaign.     Public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015     Action/2015 played an important role in increasing public awareness of the risks and opportunities of 2015.     To the statement action/2015 has raised public awareness of the agreements made in 2015 (SDGs   and climate) 42% of survey respondents answered strongly agree and 41% answered slightly agree.   Respondents in Spanish speaking countries saw lower evidence of awareness (only 28% answered strongly   agree, as opposed to 51% in French speaking countries and 46% in English speaking countries). This was   most likely because they experienced the campaign still as English-dominated, and experienced difficulties   in localising or translating campaign resources on time, as discussed in the previous chapter and the case   studies.     Because of the wide variety of events and awareness raising activities, especially around the SDGs and   COP21, it is not possible to assess the extent to which increased awareness can directly be attributed to   action/2015. There was a range of organisations working on these issues and impact can only be attributed   to action/2015 in some cases.     Stakeholders who worked on a community level gave examples of how constituents and beneficiaries of   their organisation now have a better understanding of what the SDGs or the COP21 negotiations entail, and   how this can affect their everyday life.     This needs to be considered in a local context, as increased awareness means different things at different   levels. In some rural areas, concepts such as Sustainable Development Goals are global terms that do not   mean much to the community. But while there may not be increased awareness of the SDGs themselves,        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     stakeholders cited examples of people having a better understanding of how the issues the community   does care about (such as clean water, having something to eat tomorrow and having land to live and work   on) are related to the SDGs or climate negotiations. Rather than amplifying local issues, action/2015 linked   global issues to local realities. Both the survey and the stakeholder interviews mentioned examples of   such increased awareness, providing evidence of increased awareness and understanding of the risks and   opportunities of 2015.     Action/2015 hasnt amplified local issues, but it wasnt designed to. It has localised global issues.     Governance stakeholder, Africa     A few participating organisations commented that the campaign assumed a level of basic awareness about   the issues it was working on, and stated this was not the case in their local context, making it difficult to   raise awareness.     Our region is not yet accustomed to campaigning and there was a general lack of awareness to the issues. So   it was a bit difficult to build momentum in the beginning. I think the campaign makes an assumption about   the level of awareness in certain regions that would make the campaign successful.     Survey respondent     Some stakeholders, particularly those that were involved in grassroots and community activities, indicated   that awareness was generally stronger among constituents and beneficiaries in urban areas. While they   made every effort to go out into rural areas and work with disadvantaged and vulnerable communities,   these activities often had a small reach, and limited access to internet made engagement more difficult.     While the majority of stakeholders felt that action/2015 has been successful at raising awareness on a   national and local level, there was little awareness of regional risks and opportunities. As discussed in   Chapter 4 on campaign design, identifying regional risks and opportunities and communicating them as   key priorities may have led to a larger impact for the campaign, especially around the FFD meeting.     Some compared awareness of the SDGs and the Global Goals to the level of awareness of the Millennium   Development Goals (MDGs). They found that the movement creating increased awareness of the SDGs,   including action/2015, has been very successful. A US public opinion poll shows that in the summer of 2015   8% of the US population was aware of the MDGs, but one week after the UNGA in September 20% of the   population was aware of the SDGs1. Although this impact cannot be attributed to action/2015 directly, it   shows overall increased awareness of the SDGs.     The MDGs were running for 15 years and people were not aware of what they were at the grass roots.   Through the work of action/2015, a great percentage of Nigerians are now aware of what the SDGs are and   what they stand for. For me this was very significant because its only the awareness of such kinds of goals   that will make [Nigerians] take actions that will lead to accountability. [action/2015] created the movement,   it created the follow up for the SDGs that the MDGs couldnt have.     Participating organisation, Africa     Public awareness of the action/2105 campaign and endorsement of its objectives     Stakeholders were positive about awareness of action/2015 and its objectives. Their ability to assess   awareness on different levels was determined by whether they engaged with the campaign on a local,     national,   regional   or   global   level.   Qualitative   and   quantitative   indicators   show   increased   awareness   of   the       campaign over the course of 2015.          IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     A global survey of public opinion was beyond the scope of this evaluation. However, public participation   in mobilisation events, social media activity and other modes of engagement with the campaign can all be   seen as proxies for endorsement of the campaigns objectives.     Some stakeholders cited examples of being recognised by partners, by other CSOs in their country or by   government officials as being part of action/2015. Many expressed that their participation in action/2015   generated interest or acknowledgement of the campaign among a wide range of audiences. Many   participating organisations indicated they used action/2015 branding or the action/2015 logo for most   mobilisation activities during 2015.     I think the impact is huge in Kenya because a lot of the government ministries have heard of action/2015....   I still meet people that say Oh you are from action/2015!. They would'nt remember [my organisation] but   they have seen them marching on the street.     Participating organisation, Africa     Quantitative   indicators   on   action/2015s   media   profile   show   that   the   campaign   generated   increased       awareness over time. This was mostly concentrated around mobilisation moments, in the build up to the   UNGA in September, with some media activity around the COP21 in December.     Media and Twitter engagement with action/2015     From the number of media mentions it becomes evident there is a global spread of media mentions and   social media activity. The highest number of mentions are in the United States, the United Kingdom and   India. The FFD chart shows an even greater dominance of media mentions in the US.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     5.4 inspiring the puBlic to take action, moBilisation activities   Action/2015s second objective was to inspire the public to take action in support of action/2015. Key   outcomes to meet this objective were:        Engaged   public   through   online   actions   (online   petitions,   social   media   activities,   etc.)      Engaged   public   through   in-person   activities      Engagement   of   decision   makers   around   action/2015.   In this section we will discuss the first two objectives. Chapter 5.6 will discuss engagement of policy makers   and decision makers with the campaign.     As discussed in Chapter 2, action/2015 consisted of a variety of mobilisations across the globe. The map   below shows mobilisations around the world, indicating the number of individuals that participated in   mobilisation activities throughout the year.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Action/2015 mobilisations by country in 2015       Source: Overview of mobilisation moments including: launch/ before May mobilisation, various May mobilisations, FFD, International Youth Day, UNGA, Climate   Summit mobilisation     In most countries the campaign launch, Financing for Development, International Youth Day, UNGA and   COP21 were the biggest mobilisation moments. The May Mobilisations spanned a wide range of activities   in the month of May around a diverse set of themes such as citizen participation, climate, gender, labour   rights, sexual and reproductive health and Africa Day (25 May). This was a key component of the delivery of   large mobilisation numbers during the action/2015 campaign.     The graph below gives an overview of the number of individuals that was mobilised at key campaign   moments. Because of inconsistencies in the mobilisation data it is important to note that these numbers   illustrate the amount of actions taken, and do not offer a complete overview of all actions.     Individuals mobilised for key action/2015 moments        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     For many, mobilisation was not an end in itself but a way to show that the public understands and cares   about issues like poverty, inequality and climate change. When asked about the success of a particular   mobilisation or activity, many highlighted how these led to pressure on government officials or illustrated   that the citizens of countries all over the world care about what happened in New York or Paris.     The best evidence of action/2015s achievements in my country were media coverage, the general public   talking a lot about SDGs during radio programmes, government leaders referring to our policy demands   during public meetings, and more CSOs joining the national platform.     Survey respondent     The mobilisation by action/2015 was a very powerful voice. Had it not been there then the pressure and   stake of civil society would not have been that strong. The involvement of civil society by the UN really got   strengthened by action/2015. It created pressure.     Participating organisation, Asia     Some indicated their organisation delivered more activities throughout the year because of their   participation in action/2015. One stakeholder illustrated that while normally his organisation would   organise activities mostly around issues directly related to his organisation, participating in action/2015   resulted in being active all-year round.     A few stakeholders commented that many organisations took part in action/2015 as part of a wider   organisational strategy. Some were already working on the issues that they engaged with under the   action/2015 umbrella. There is a strong variation between countries on this point; in some cases the   activities around the SDGs and other key moments were predominantly related to action/2015, while in   other countries there was a wide range of organisations working on mobilisations to fight climate change,   poverty and inequality.     Some stakeholders noted a big difference between mobilising for different topics and issues. A few felt that   it was difficult to engage the public around FFD as this was perceived to be a complex issue. International   Youth Day, in contrast, was a much easier and simpler topic to generate public interest for, and enabled   participating organisations to reach out to new targets and mobilise wider audiences.     5.5 BuilDing a stronger civil society movement   The third objective of the action/2015 campaign was to build a bigger, stronger movement to put pressure   on world leaders to deliver truly ambitious outcomes to end climate change, poverty and inequality in 2015,   and hold them to account in the years to come.     Action/2015 has been most successful at achieving this third objective, meeting all of the indented   outcomes, which are outlined below.        Increased   campaign   reach   among   CSOs      Increased   network   engagement   and   collaboration   to   put   pressure   on   world   leaders      Stronger   movement   ready   to   work   on   holding   leaders   to   account   in   the   years   to   come   Create a space to work together     One of the key outcomes of the action/2015 campaign is that it created a reason for CSOs in countries   around the world to cooperate, share and build networks. It created a common objective for groups to sit   together, coordinate, align their activities and strategies.        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     This was the campaigns most important outcome. As discussed in Chapter 4, in some countries the   campaign built on existing coordination structures, while in others it created new coalitions and networks.   In many countries those CSOs now report an increased level of trust and a basis for working together in the   future.     I got more friends and when you have more friends you feel stronger.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     In particular, action/2015 created a space for organisations working on international development and   climate change to cooperate. Some commented that action/2015 was the first time these groups had   constructively cooperated and coordinated activities, and that was a major success of the campaign.     One interesting area where it added value was creating a constructive space for climate and poverty   groups to come together. So, for example, the climate groups were very good at calling out when texts said   development without saying sustainable development.     Governance stakeholder, global     Some commented on the importance of having an external movement such as action/2015 that all CSOs in   the country could get involved with and that was not restricted in terms of topic or themes. This created a   natural space for all types of organisations to work together.     Action/2015 gave us a platform where we could come together and create synergy. For many years it was   people doing their own things. Normally when everyone is doing their own thing wastage and duplication of   resources happened. This helped to come together and move partnerships at a national level.     Participating organisation, Africa     Action/2015 expanded participating organisations networks, both online and offline. The majority of those   who took part indicated that because of action/2015 they had connected to new people and organisations   within their own community, region or country. Some were now in touch with organisations in other   countries that were working on similar issues, sharing experiences, learning from each other and building   the foundations of potential long-term relationships.     Increase local skills and capacity     Action/2015 also increased the skills and capacity of many participating organisations. 36% of survey   respondents saw a strong increase and 43% saw some increase in capacity of local NGOs in their country.   Respondents from Spanish speaking countries reported a lower increase (13% saw a strong increase and   57% saw some increase) than respondents from other countries. Via the Google Groups and the shared   resources, action/2015 enabled organisations to see different ways of campaigning and examples from all   over the world.     In most Southern countries there is at least some experience in organising public mobilisation events on   the street. However, many stakeholders indicated that action/2105 had provided them or their organisation   with new ideas, know-how, skills and materials for campaigning. For example, the send a postcard to your   Prime Minister campaign represented a new approach for some organisations. A couple stakeholders felt   more prepared for future campaigns and are more likely to try new approaches and tools in the future.     There were lots of different levels of expertise; we saw a good progression over the course of the campaign.   That people towards end of the campaign needed less help in terms of what to do, adapting material. That   was really building capacity.     Governance stakeholder, global        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     Action/2015 also contributed to the development of skills in designing resources and campaign assets. In   emerging countries where the action/2015 movement was active such as Brazil, India and South Africa,   design agencies started developing campaigns and creative assets.     One stakeholder commented that action/2015 has contributed to taking a more fact-based approach to   developing resources. They used information from action/2015 materials to inform their stakeholders and   target audiences.     Sometimes we would go to the government with facts and information we had gotten from action/2015   emails. That is informative and it speaks positively to the leaders in the government. Sometimes CSOs are not   prepared to give facts, and action/2015 has set this precedence in terms of specific asks.     Participating organisation, Africa     5.6 influencing policy   Influencing policy as an objective of the campaign     The most contested area of this evaluation was its expected impact on policy makers and decision makers.   Many stakeholders, whether external, engaged with action/2105 at a global or local level, expressed the   view that a campaign like action/2015 cannot have real impact without influencing decision makers and   policy.     Influencing policy was not a main objective of the campaign but some felt this is the ultimate (and only)   way to change. One stakeholder stated that 2015 was a year of policy work and that using it to strengthen   civil society networks when there are so few opportunities to influence policy at the level of the UN   negotiations in New York and Paris was not the right approach.     We especially cannot separate mobilisation from advocacy  While action/2015 clearly maintained its   focus on the mobilisation side this year, we realise the limits of this approach and sincerely believe that   we would benefit from merging initiatives like Beyond2015 and action/2015 to play off each initiatives   strengths for more impact on the decision-making processes. Such a rapprochement would enable us to   strengthen CSOs mobilisation strategies through intel from advocacy, and to reinforce advocacy messages   through automatic updates on mobilisations numbers and stories that would illustrate advocacy messages   and the importance for leaders to take action.     Survey respondent     Essentially, we should have been in a partnership with the people who were doing policy such that there   was a mutual understanding that our work was helping them and opening a door to them and that the fact   that we werent taking specific policy positions didnt mean that we werent going to have a political impact.   We should have been a bit more like two sides to the same coin, with one side creating political space and the   other political content.     Participating organisation, Europe        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     On the other hand, most stakeholders understood that a campaign of the scale and breadth of action/2015   faces trade-offs, and that action/2015 had a clear focus on mobilisation.     If we had to come up with a policy framework before doing anything, we would spend ages on it and we   would lose people if we had one.     Governance stakeholder, global     Keeping it away from policy dialogue worked, in a way, because it means that everybody got involved. This   was just mobilisation, and that helped because if it was more policy-oriented then there would be so many   other organisations that would want to bring their own agenda to the table.     Participating organisation, Asia     One couldnt have ones cake and eat it. By saying it would be a loose structure, decentralised, a flotilla,   with no command of control. All that really helped ensure that the breadth was impressive and the actions   happened in a number of countries around the world without being totally centrally guided. It makes it   difficult at the same time to also be so close to political lobbying.     External stakeholder, global     Some commented that had the campaign wanted to truly shape ambitions for the SDGs, and to a lesser   extent the COP21, it should have started its work earlier and stronger. By the time that most action/2015   mobilisations around the UNGA took place the goals were already agreed upon.     Actual policy influence     In effect, action/2015 did have an impact on decision makers and policy makers, mostly on a local and   global level. As discussed in Chapter 3 some stakeholders were not aware that influencing policy makers   was not a key objective, and some smaller organisations linked mobilisation activities to engagement with   policy makers.     In general, this type of impact was strongest at a local level and on global levels, across Africa, Asia and Latin   America. Local policy makers and media were more accessible than those at a national level, and in some   countries CSOs had existing local networks and relationships.     On a national level, some coalitions pressured their leaders to attend the international negotiations and   some delegations adopted demands proposed by action/2015. Many cited examples of engagement   with policy makers, such as meeting with Ministers of Finance, the Deputy secretary, or the government   delegation for negotiations at FFD, UNGA or COP21. One stakeholder cited an example of explaining to   a key government official what the COP21 consisted of, and later seeing evidence of this conversation   repeated in a speech. Others stated examples where proposed targets and messaging for negotiations were   adopted by their countries delegation and presented at the Financing for Development summit.     Influencing officials at a national level mostly had an impact on their demands for international   negotiations. To what extent this will translate into policy at a national level remains to be see and will only   become clear when governments have started implementing the SDGs and will show whether they are   adhering to their commitments.     The UN is extremely kind as an advocacy target. You go out on the street and they invite you to come and   talk to them. Governments are the opposite.     Governance stakeholder, global        IMPACT AND OUTCOMES     On a global level, impact on the UN was perceived to be strong. The presence of vocal CSOs throughout the   negotiations gave a sense that the world is watching. Both global level and external stakeholders indicated   that the unity and cooperation of civil society had a significant impact on UN negotiations, especially the   SDGs. Some participating organisations stated they were pleased with the way their cause / issue was   represented in the SDGs, and attributed this success partly to the action/2015 campaign.     We needed civil society to come together, collaborate, have that level of collaboration like we havent had   in the past. That carried through in the negotiations, the entire weekend. Civil society was there the whole   time.     External stakeholder, global     .Older people and ageing issues got included in the SDGs! It was not only me and action/2015, but   many people across the world. But finally out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in almost 15 you can   incorporate ageing issues.     Governance stakeholder, Asia     As noted by a couple stakeholders, it is important to put mobilisation and its effect on policy influence in   perspective. One stakeholder stated that in a lot of countries in the Global South going out and marching   on the street is not a way to raise attention anymore; for example India was asked to deliver big numbers for   mobilisations, and they did so, but having 800,000 people on the street doesnt have a lot of impact in India   anymore. These stakeholders suggested that the type of mobilisation that action/2015 did does not have a   long-term impact on policy makers.     Mobilisation that really changes policy decisions, is not the kind that action/2015 was doing. Governments   listen to sustained, ongoing mobilisation, they do not listen to one day of people coming and dancing on the   street.     Governance stakeholder, global        FUTURE: STAkEHOLDER VIEWS ON THE FUTURE       6.1 introDuction   Action/2015 has formally come to an end, and there are many views on its future, next steps and on how   action/2015 should build on the momentum and enthusiasm built throughout the campaign. This chapter   discusses stakeholders views on these points.     6.2 vieWs on the future of the campaign   Most stakeholders had considered the future of action/2015 and had clearly given thought to the followup   for the campaign. Many felt that action/2015 showed the possibilities and opportunities of a loosely   coordinated global campaign. They saw it as important to build on this momentum and to sustain the   energy that was created during action/2015.     Theres an appetite right now to talk about joint campaigning. Going forward, whats next? Action/2015   showed that it can happen and that it works. Its a way that civil society can loosely coordinate a campaign.   Of course theres reticence by some that dont want to loose their identities and exactly what they stand   for. But then theres a readiness to form different networks and groupings, because action/2015 basically   emerged from a discussion between different campaigning networks and then it went to mobilising activists   and civil society organisations around the world. There is a need for a global movement to continue and I   think action/2015 played a clear role in reassuring people that this could happen.     External stakeholder, global     Many felt that this should not be done under the action/2015 brand. Some indicated it is a pity to stop   using a name and logo that have built up considerable awareness and recognition in a relatively short   period of time. However, many feel that action/2015 was designed for one year and should adhere to its   intended lifetime.     Action2015 should not make the mistake of prolonging its own existence. It is not designed as a long-term   campaign. It was designed as a call to action and has fulfilled its purpose.     Governance stakeholder, global     Some felt that action/2015 could have improved planning for the future at an earlier stage, and pointed   out that using a name that is linked to the year 2015 rules out options to extend its mandate or use existing   resources. One stakeholder indicated that action/2015 could have improved its data strategy. It should have   designed a platform or other ways to communicate with participating organisations and others that were   involved in the campaign after its formal end in December 2015.     A majority of stakeholders indicated they planned to continue working on action/2015 themes and issues.   73% of survey respondents plans to keep using elements of the campaign in the future. A large majority   expect constituents or beneficiaries to keep engaging in civil society activities to hold leaders to account, as   is shown in the graph below.        FUTURE: STAkEHOLDER VIEWS ON THE FUTURE      Survey responses on continued work on holding leaders to account     Do you expect your constituents/ beneficiaries to keep engaging in   civil society activities to hold leaders to account in 2016?         As illustrated in the case studies, a number of countries stated they had already started follow-up   conversations and were planning for the future, building on existing action/2015 structures. Most   stakeholders indicated that the relationships and networks that have been built through action/2015 will   continue in the future and will lead to long-term cooperation.     The relationships that we have established through action/2015 will continue.     Participating organisation, Africa     Many stakeholders, especially those working at a national level, noted that the most important issues   for the future will be the accountability framework for national governments. Tracking progress on the   implementation of the negotiations and ensuring governments adhere to the targets they committed to   in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris is seen as essential. Some specified the key focus for this work, which   would include research to identify gaps in national policies that enable the SDGs to be delivered, further   awareness raising and mobilisation, and monitoring and evaluation.     A couple of stakeholders made suggestions on how action/2015 could build on the momentum of the   campaign. These included linking reporting mechanisms to the key dates of the three negotiations   that were held in 2015, and establishing a yearly progress report for every country. Another suggested   campaigning in the next phase should have a stronger theme-based focus or a renewed focus on building   civil society capacity at a national level.     Most stakeholders indicate that lack of funding and resources is the biggest barrier to continued   engagement with these issues. A couple mention other reasons like a loss of momentum, a lack of renewed   focus and lack of messaging and tailored tools.     Other campaigns that action/2015 participating organisations are working on or will be involved with in the   future include: GCAP coalitions, So now what, Together 2030 and activities from the climate movement.   Many stakeholders express the need to think about the future of the movement and how best to carry   forward the enthusiasm, Southern leadership and momentum built by the campaign.     What an incredible movement to have been a part of! A truly inspirational campaign that brought together   a diverse set of individuals and organisations with a unique passion and drive for protecting people and   planet. It was a real honour and a privilege to have been a part action/2015.     Survey respondent       CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED       7.1 introDuction   This chapter synthesises the findings of this report into final conclusions, recommendations and lessons   learned. It includes lessons for the future of the action/2015 network and to inform the design of future civil   society coordination mechanisms.     It consists of chapter 7.2 on key conclusions, chapter 7.3 on recommendations for the action/2015 coalition   and future global campaigns and chapter 7.4 on key lessons learned.     7.2 conclusions   In many ways, action/2015 was a transitional campaign. It can be seen as both the last of an old   generation of global campaigns and the first of a new generation. It looked to the future in being strongly   rooted in the Global South. It was collaborative, inclusive and owned by its participating organisations.   However, it was still a campaign primarily designed and funded by Northern funders and NGOs.     The campaign met the expectations of participating organisations for the year. It informed and   mobilised the public about the importance of the international negotiations in 2015 and, most successfully,   built a stronger movement of CSOs. The campaign showed that with a limited amount of central funding it   is possible to meaningfully inspire civil society across the world.     The key impact of the campaign was that global civil society groups learned how to work together.     Action/2015 was characterised by a high level of enthusiasm, sharing and cooperation among participating   organisations, especially when compared to previous global campaigns and coalitions. There is a high level   of enthusiasm among those in the coalition to keep working together.     Action/2015 laid the groundwork for long-term impact, especially in terms of connecting national   agendas and government policy to global policy frameworks. The campaign was explicitly designed for   public mobilisation and long-term change in CSO networks, and had less focus on policy impact in the year.   This is something that participating organisations are keen to build on in the future. The campaign has   shown there is real public constituency for the SDGs. It provided a basis for long-term commitment from   younger generations and new audiences, inspiring a new generation of activists.     Action/2015 took meaningful steps towards Southern ownership of a global campaign. This was   something it had explicitly set out to do in its objectives. Funding and setup of the early governance of   the campaign came from Northern funders and NGOs, but as the year progressed Southern organisations   became more involved. While the original participation in governance felt symbolic for many, by the time   the coalition was functional, most felt Southern engagement in leadership was meaningful. Levels of   perceived Southern ownership were high. Powerful Southern voices emerged through the process.     One of the key achievements of the campaign was that it created a space for climate and   development groups to work together. This is an important achievement. Across the coalition, the   number of CSOs working on development was higher than those working on climate, and there were fewer   strong climate-focused actors, but the connections made across issues appear meaningful and lasting.     Overall, the flotilla approach was fit for purpose. The campaign showed the benefits of leveraging   resources through coalition and partnership and of campaigning under one global brand. Participating   organisations tested new tools and approaches to engage their communities and were positive about their   experiences. Much of the feedback on campaign design and delivery is that it wasnt enough localised or   adjusted to local context, but in some ways this reflected local capacity and resources to adapt globally   provided resources.        CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     Globally, the campaign did not engage with non-NGO civil society actors, such as faith groups and   trades union, as successfully as it could have done. There is no reason this could not have happened,   given the design and objectives of the campaign. Most expected these actors would take part in the   campaign. The coalition could have been stronger if they were included, but this was not a priority in   the planning. It should be prioritised in planning for future campaigns. Action/2015 was more open for   engagement with the private sector than previous coalitions and had some links at a local and national   level, but this was not extensive.     Some noted the absence of other big global NGOs in the coalition. This was automatically assumed to be   a weakness, but whilst it would have added additional resources, it would also have added complexity to   the governance of the campaign at a central level. It also may have challenged the emerging Southern   leadership. The impact of this absence is unclear.     There is a strong case for maintaining some of the action/2015 structures and networks. The practical   task of initiating global structures is always likely to be taken on by those with the greatest access and   resources. The members of the network established through the year should consider how best to carry   forward the Southern leadership and mobilisation achieved by action/2015.     7.3 recommenDations   Recommendations for members of the action/2015 coalition     Action/2015 should build on what it has achieved. It has created a platform for future collaboration. We   make four recommendations for the members of the action/2015 campaign:     1. Members of action/2015 should keep the network alive. It has created a platform for   organisations to collaborate, rather than a single global movement of individual citizens. It has   created real local mobilisation capacity in new places. There needs to be infrastructure for on-going   knowledge sharing, coordination and planning, carrying forward the objectives and Southern led   ownership of the campaign, building on the enthusiasm to work together.   2. Members of action/2015 should identify and plan for moments to come together as a global   network. These could have a thematic focus or could be linked to key mobilisation moments from   the 2015 campaigning year. These moments should have a forward calendar where key moments   will be identified. The coalition needs to think about how these moments will be resourced.   3. Campaigners should consider how they will hold their governments to account. National   governments made real commitments in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris. Members of the   coalition should connect national policy and performance to these commitments, and consider   them in a local context. This will require a focus on policy monitoring and evaluation, gathering   data on implementation and moments to hold governments to account.   4. The coalition should keep building an inclusive network. It should explore broadening the   network to include those civil society actors that were not part of the original campaign, and invest   in existing relationships between participating organisations.   Recommendations for future global campaigns     Action/2015 appears to have triggered a new enthusiasm for global coalition working. We make four   recommendations for those seeking to build similar global structures in the future:     1. Global campaigns should focus on mobilisation over policy when the objective is   demonstrating broad public pressure for political change. It is an inclusive approach that   requires wide participation and high level messaging. The trade offs are accountability, specificity   and a limited call to action. The decentralised flotilla is an appropriate model for certain types   of campaigning. There is no central bottleneck to action, limited sign-off processes, and a lot of   self-organising communication across the campaign. It may prove challenging for this model   to accommodate more detailed policy and advocacy work without creative thinking about new   approaches.      CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     2. Global campaigns in the future will be most effective when they can connect across issues,   and empower new voices. They must be led by a diverse set of actors rooted in the Global South.   Action/2015 was transitional in the sense that it marked an important step on this journey. The next   generation of global campaigning should build on its achievements. This implies that NGOs and   their funders need to continue to reflect on their fundamental role in society, how they represent   power, their legitimacy and added value.   3. Global campaigns should be as inclusive as possible, and prioritise this early on in campaign   design. Meaningful coalition building happens when a campaign includes a wide spectrum   of non-NGO civil society actors. There is no reason not to include wider non-NGO civil society   groups at a global level with a platform of this kind. There should be more creative thinking   about engaging with the private sector. The emergence of social enterprises, B Corps, mutual   organisations and co-operatives shows that the line between the private sector and civil society is   increasingly opaque.   4. Internally, there may be value in under-promising and over-delivering when planning,   designing and communicating coalitions. This is counter-intuitive to many in campaigning, who   seek to inspire with impossible objectives. However, many interviewees close to the centre of the   coalition expressed relatively low expectations for the campaign, and exceeding these has left   people ready to do more. It also created the space for people in national campaigns to set their   own expectations. This may not always be appropriate for external communications, but it is an   area worth further consideration.   7.4 lessons learneD   Action/2015 offered a number of general lessons for global campaigners. These lessons can inform best   practices for global campaigns and civil society coordination mechanisms.     1. Decentralise but with central capacity: the structure of a loosely coordinated flotilla campaign   can function well, enabling participating organisations to choose those issues most suitable to   them and not being governed by a central authority. However, basic campaign functions like   communications and fundraising should be globally coordinated, trickling down to a national level,   and therefore need central capacity and resources. People matter, and having human resources at a   global level that can build trust, connect and inspire engagement and cooperation is invaluable.   2. The more local, the better: Local languages, faces, issues and wording ensure the campaign is   grounded in peoples everyday reality and inspire stronger engagement and commitment to the   campaign. Resources and campaign materials will be more effective the more they can be aligned   or adapted to local reality (this includes using editable design-formats).   3. Build on existing structures: In many countries and regions, existing coordination structures,   networks and partner coalitions are the best way to build a global campaign. It works well and   leverages the strength of existing networks and relationships. Action/2015 did this in some   countries like India and Mexico, but could have increased the use of existing structures on a   national and regional level. Global campaigners should actively seek out opportunities to identify   and use these existing networks.   4. Invest in national coordination: Strong national coordination can lead to increased impact and   reach. The following factors improved functioning of national coalitions during the action/2015   campaign:      Leveraging   national   networks   and   partnership   structures      A   strong   full   time   coordinator   that   can   dedicate   time   and   resources   to   the   campaign   and   does   not have to balance interests of a host organisation        Engagement   with   young   people   leads   to   broader   reach   and   involvement   of   new   groups      A   high   level   of   funding   enables   national   coalitions   to   strengthen   resourcing,   increase   capacity   and invest in coalition building        CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS & LESSONS LEARNED     5. Early engagement and wide engagement makes a difference: Include as many organisations,   individuals, views and opinions as early as possible if you want to design a truly global, inclusive   and decentralised campaign. Southern organisations need to take part not only in the delivery, but   also in the very first stages of the design, ensuring they not only get a seat at the table, but can lead   the discussion.   We need to invest time, money and emotional intelligence in building global movements.     Survey respondent     6. Plan, plan, plan and reflect: When designing a global campaign it is important to start planning   early and ensure timelines allow enough time for reflection. A campaign full of activities   throughout the year inspires enthusiasm, but also mobilisation fatigue and rush. It is important   to allow enough time to learn from the past, plan, share and review before the delivery actually   happens. Fewer, bigger moments may be more effective than spreading effort too thinly.   An imaginative, innovative approach that is not resource heavy can contribute greatly to creating   awareness and also bring in a lot of energy and enthusiasm.     Survey respondent     7. Consider trade-offs around messaging: It is important to consider the trade-offs between high   level messaging and specific, targeted messaging. High level messaging enables participation of a   wide range of groups and can foster a climate of cooperation and sharing. It enables organisations   to take part in a campaign working on issues aligned to an organisations themes and issues.   However, specific asks often have increased political impact and present a stronger call to action.   Future campaigners should consider the trade-offs between different types of messaging and its   effect on campaign participation and impact   8. A united civil society is influential: Action/2015 provided strong evidence that when civil society   cooperates and works together it has a powerful voice. Between local, national, regional and global   networks civil society organisations have a tremendous network and mobilising millions of people   across the world sends a clear message. Additionally, being able to speak to a united civil society   fosters engagement with decision makers as it is much easier to speak to one representative voice   The most important lessons learned from action/2015? First, there is strength in numbers. Second,   working in consortia is advantageous and third, funding many organisations, no matter how small, yield   great results.     Survey respondent     9. Evaluation is information: When designing a campaign ensure that you make optimal use of the   feedback of its participants, and that tracking, monitoring and evaluation is set up consistently   and thoroughly. Some also suggested that action/2015 could have benefited from increased   options to share campaign materials and evidence (photos, videos). A more coherent approach to   evaluation and monitoring optimises outcomes from campaign reviews and evaluations. However,   a decentralised approach makes a necessary trade-off in terms of the data that can be collated   centrally.   10. Mobilisation is a means, political change is the end: Raising awareness of the opportunities of   2015 and mobilising millions of people to take action is important, but it is only a means to an end.   The ultimate (and only) way to real change is to influence policy makers and decision makers, and   a global campaign should mobilise people in service of policy change, with a continuous exchange   of information. It should strengthen mobilisation strategies with input from advocacy and support   advocacy with evidence and messaging from mobilisation.   Giving politicians a sense that this wasnt just a UN process is a gift that will give again.       "
CAN-2.txt,"CANADA AND THE UN CLIMATE NEGOTIATIONS:  A Paris Package that  shows Canada Cares  CLIMATE ACTIONNETWORKRacCANRÉSEAU ACTIONCLIMAT  SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE  A DIFFERENCE BEFORE PARIS  November 2015  Canada and the UN Climate Negotiations: A Paris Package that shows Canada Cares  Canada has a lot of  catching up to do.  Since 1992 when the  United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) was negotiated at  the Earth Summit, our country  has contributed less than its  fair share to the work we all  need to do to protect the  climate. The result in 2015 is  an economy over-reliant on  fossil fuels and investing less  than it could in the transition  to a 100% renewable energy  system to power our economy  and to ensure a healthy quality  of life.  From November 29th to December  11, 2015 in Paris governments are  expected to finalize negotiations  on a new agreement and package  of implementation decisions under  the UNFCCC1 to limit global carbon  pollution. Canada needs, however,  to start making things right ahead  of Paris starting at a meeting of  ministers hosted by France and  Peru November 8th to 10th and  at the G-20 in Turkey November  15-16th. Canadians and media can  use this document to compare  Canada’s performance at these  early meetings and in Paris against  metrics that have the best chance  of keeping the climate system  in balance.  There is a consensus among governments and  climate scientists that keeping the climate  system in balance requires that global warming  stay well below an average of 2oC above pre-industrial  levels. This level of warming, however,  exceeds what is safe for the world’s most  vulnerable countries. These countries are calling  for global warming of no more than an average  of 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels to protect  their dignity and well-being; a position endorsed  by the more than 950 organizations working  together to advance climate protection under  the auspices of Climate Action Network.  In its latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed the global  carbon budget implied by varying levels of  global warming. To have a 66% chance of keeping  temperature increases below 2oC requires  world-wide cumulative emissions to not exceed  1,000 GtCO2 (billion tonnes of CO2) between  2011 and 20502,3. An analysis of the aggregate  effects of governments pledges received by the  UNFCCC by October 1, 2015 shows that 75%  of the world’s global carbon budget will have  been consumed within 15 years (by 2030) AFTER  taking account of emission reduction promises.  The UNFCCC Secretariat concludes that “global  aggregate emission levels in 2025 and 2030  resulting from the INDCs (Intended Nationally  Determined Contributions) do not fall within  2oC scenarios”.4 The Secretariat also notes that  current INDC pledges do not “fall within leastcost  2oC scenarios”. If the goal is to prevent  1.5oC warming and if we want to increase the  probability of success (most people would not  accept a 33% chance of failure in almost any  decision-making scenario), then under current  commitments the entire global carbon budget  would be consumed much earlier.  Climate Action Tracker and the UNFCCC calculate  that government INDC pledges commit  the world to at least 2.7oC warming. Clearly,  government contributions to the current climate  negotiations fall well short of keeping the world  from dangerous levels of global warming.The latest round of UNFCCC climate negotiations  was launched in 2011 at the 17th Conference  of the Parties meeting in Durban, South Africa.  Governments agreed at that time to deliver a  new and universal greenhouse gas reduction  protocol, legal instrument or other outcome with  legal force under the Convention applicable to all  Parties by 2015 for the period beyond 2020.The negotiation of a new agreement for  the post-2020 period does not imply that  government commitments for 2020 are to be  abandoned. On the contrary, Parties with 2020  commitments are expected to live up to their  pledges and to increase their pre-2020 ambition7.  Accelerated ambition is required to get  the world on track to peaking global greenhouse  gas emissions and then setting a course for a  rapid and steep decline. Delaying action to 2020  simply makes achieving our 2025 and 2030 goals  more difficult to achieve.  An analysis of the aggregate  effects of governments  pledges received by the  UNFCCC by October 1,  2015 shows that 75% of  the world’s global carbon  budget will have been  consumed within 15 years  (by 2030) AFTER taking  account of emission  reduction promises.  CANADA RECOMMENDATION #1:  Strengthen efforts to meet  our 2020 domestic target  and enhance international  investments to secure  additional global reductions  Canada currently is on track to be at least 19%  above 2005 levels by 2020 relative to its 2020  target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by  17% below 2005 (even after including dubious  contributions from land-based removals)8.  The federal government can significantly  enhance Canada’s international credibility on  climate protection by committing to strengthen  efforts to meet our 2020 domestic target and to  enhance international investments that secure  additional global reductions. International investment  options include financial contributions  to the UNFCCC Green Climate Fund and through  bilateral support and cooperation agreements.  Establishing a federal/provincial process,  starting with a meeting of First Ministers prior  to the Paris meeting, or soon thereafter, would  further signal Canada’s seriousness in turning  the page on a long history of inaction on the  climate protection file. Coordination among  federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal  governments, as well as First Nations, Inuit and  Metis communities is urgently needed if we are  to succeed in the transition to a climate friendly  energy system and quality of life.  CANADA RECOMMENDATION #2:  Strengthen Canada’s  INDC (Intended Nationally  Determined Contribution)  to the Paris negotiations  In spring 2015, Canada announced that it would  commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions  30% below 2005 levels by 2030 as its contribution  to the UNFCCC climate negotiations.  Canada’s so-called Intended Nationally Determined  Contribution (INDC)9 failed to meet the  test of best practice as recommended by the  World Resources Institute10 and was rated as  inadequate by Climate Action Tracker11.  CANADA’S PROPOSED INDC GETS A  POOR GRADE FOR FAILING TO:  • Set a greenhouse gas reduction target in line  with its fair share or what’s required to limit  global warming to well below 2oC;  • Include adaptation commitments;  • Be transparent with respect to how Canada’s  target will be achieved; and  • Establish a robust domestic process for setting  our targets or development of domestic  and implementation plans.  A responsible target that would be consistent  with Canada’s capacity, our fair share, and  what is a scientifically credible emissions level  would commit the country to cutting national  greenhouse gas emissions by at least 35% below  2005 levels by 2025. Canada’s proposed target  misses the market by 5 years and is weaker  than required.  TO REACH A STANDARD THAT SHOWS  THE WORLD THAT CANADA CARES, WE  SHOULD COMMIT TO:  1. Take action in line with keeping global  warming to an average of 1.5oC and an  acknowledgement that limiting global  warming to safe levels implies phasing out  the use of fossil fuels and a transition to a  renewable, decarbonized energy system  by 2050.  a. Canada should develop a strategic  national plan by 2020 to shift rapidly  away from our high-carbon economic  development model to a sustainable  development model that ensures full  decarbonization of the economy by  2050.  2. A 2025 target of at least 35% below 2005,  a 50% reduction by 2030 and decarbonization  by 2050. Canada’s targets should be  expressed as a carbon budget.  3. Enshrine Canada’s greenhouse gas reduction  targets in domestic law with implementation  and enforcement responsibility  clearly identified and assigned.  4. Establish a robust domestic process for  developing a national climate protection  implementation plan in 2016 that involves  First Ministers (Prime Minister/Premiers),  appropriate federal, provincial/territorial  ministries, municipalities, and indigenous  representatives. A national action plan  must articulate clear timelines for implementation,  including spelling out financial  contributions and responsibilities for  federal, provincial/territorial, and municipal  governments.  5. Up to $4 billion CDN in financial contributions  by 2020 to international greenhouse  gas reductions through contributions to  initiatives like the Green Climate Fund and  other bilateral arrangements. Half of these  contributions should support mitigation  projects and half should support adaptation  projects.  6. Develop a national climate change  adaptation plan and commit to requiring  cumulative (including upstream and  downstream impacts, as well as  interactions with other relevant existing,  planned and proposed projects) climate  impact assessments for all infrastructure  investments.  7. Transparency so that all assumptions  underlying greenhouse gas emissions,  projections and measures can be quantified,  verified, and compared to other  country commitments. Canada especially  needs to be transparent with regard to its  calculation of the sources and removals  relating to the land sector.  8. Eliminate all subsidies to the fossil fuel  sector beginning immediately and being  completed no later than 2020.  CANADA RECOMMENDATION #3:  Contribute to a Successful  Outcome in Paris by  Endorsing a robust Paris  PackageA commitment to best practice standard for  Canada also requires pressing all governments  to agree in Paris to:  • An internationally binding agreement that  can be ratified and that establishes critical  infrastructure, including:  »» A Long-Term Goal in line with keeping global  warming to 1.5oC: the phase out of fossil  fuel emissions and phase in of 100% renewable  energy for all as early as possible, but  no later than 2050.  The requirement to develop national  strategic plans to decarbonize  economies by 2050 that would be  submitted to the UNFCCC by 2020 and  be in line with Agenda 2030 sustainable  development goals.  »» A “Paris Ambition Mechanism” to facilitate  the process of increasing ambition within  the Paris Agreements.  Current global commitments on offer  for Paris to cut greenhouse gas pollution  potentially commit the world to at least  3oC of warming. A short commitment  period ensures the world avoids locking  in low levels of ambition (agreement  in 2015 for a 10 year commitment  period locks down ambition until 2030).  It creates incentives for early action,  encourages political responsiveness to  falling prices of low-carbon technologies  and other ‘real world’ events, and  maintains political accountability  because current governments more  clearly responsible for achieving  targets.»» The Paris Ambition Mechanism rests on  three pillars:  Scientific adequacy assessments and an  Equity Reference Framework embedded  in the 5-year commitment periods,  including:  A no-backsliding principle.  A progression clause that ensures  countries increasingly upscale individual  commitments on mitigation and finance  in future cycles of commitments.  Common five-year commitment periods  for mitigation for all countries, as well  as synchronized five-year cycles for  provision of climate finance.  Collective and individual adequacy  assessments that include active civil  society participation and are based on  the most recent scientific assessments  combined with a science-based equity  reference framework.A process (or “matchbox”) that  matches conditional contributions  with international support, requiring  the following provisions in the core  agreement:  A mandate to the UNFCCC Secretariat  to set up a registry for conditional  INDCs15 (as early as 2016) in order to  clearly identify the potential mitigation  and adaptation actions that could be  unlocked with provision of means of  implementation (MOI). This should be  followed by establishing a transparent  matching facility at the 22nd Conference  of the Parties session (2016) to match  international financial, technological, and  technical support with supplemental,  conditional elements of INDCs from  particular countries. This matching  mechanism can build on the current  NAMA (Nationally Appropriate Mitigation  Actions) registry and should build on the  high-level facilitator process suggested  under Work Stream 2 (a work group developing  recommendations on enhancing  pre-2020 action).An invitation to countries to provide  further information on their mitigation,  adaptation and loss and damage needs  facilitated by support (financial and  capacity building) in order for this information  to be taken into account during  the next cycle of commitments.  A robust and common Measurement,  Review and Verification (MRV)  framework:  A common, tiered and dynamic MRV  framework that progresses towards  common accounting and MRV, respecting  respective capabilities  A provision to create a robust MRV  framework for public and private finance  provisions  Upfront information requirements for  each round of INDCs as reflected in the  Lima Call for Climate Action (Decision 1/  CP.20, paragraph 14)  • A Global Adaptation Goal that establishes  predictable and sufficient financing for  adaptation. The United Nations Environment  Programme estimates developing countries  could face adaptation costs of approximately  $150 billion USD a year by .17 The  Paris agreement should protect the dignity  of vulnerable populations by committing to  generate grant-based adaptation investments  of at least $50 billion USD a year beginning  by 2020 and to ramp up compensation for  loss and damage where adaptation is not  viable or practical.  »» Establish as a standalone commitment  within the Paris agreement for loss and  damage to ensure financial support flows to  those people most vulnerable and without  prospect of adaptation.  • Annual goals for public finance that secures  international public finance investments of  at least $100 billion USD with half going to  cutting carbon pollution and half to adaption  by 2020. The Paris Agreement should also  commit to the rapid phase-out of subsidies to  the fossil fuel sector. Studies suggest global  investment requirements in clean energy of  at least $1 trillion USD a year are required  by 203018 to stay below 2oC warming above  pre-industrial levels. Clearly, the Paris agreement  must create mechanisms to leverage  public finance and for stimulating private  investments in renewable energy. Creation  of a Global Technology Fund would support  achievement of a 100% renewable energy  system by 2050.  • Principles for social and ecological integrity  and transparent rules for the land sector  that prioritize the protection and restoration  of ecosystems and identify and facilitate  emissions reductions from all sources. It  is essential that government ensure that  emission reductions and removals from  natural ecosystems19 are in addition to action  in other sectors, and are in line with all  relevant international obligations. Actions  to reduce emissions in the land sector must  prioritize activities which promote rights,  food security, and protect biodiversity, and  allow for a per capita food security threshold.  These priority activities include reducing  and phasing out deforestation and forest  degradation, protecting natural forests, and  restoring degraded ecosystems for example  through re-wetting peatlands.  • Market Mechanism rules that:  »» Establish principles to ensure the environmental  integrity of the agreement. These  principles must require that emissions  reductions are real, additional, verifiable,  and permanent; avoid double counting  of effort; are supplemental to ambitious  national mitigation, ensure net atmospheric  benefits.  »» Allow only countries that have economy-  wide targets, preferably expressed as  multi-year carbon budgets, not just single  year targets, to use markets for compliance.  »» Ensure a common accounting system for  measuring and reporting reductions in both  host and sponsor countries.  »» Not recognize units from the Kyoto Protocol’s  pre-2020 mechanisms for compliance  with its post-2020 mitigation commitments.  • A Conference of the Parties decision that:  »» Puts in place the required decision-making  processes, mandates, rules and guidelines  required to ensure smooth and effective  operation of the Paris Agreement.  »»Mandates ambitious mitigation, adaptation,  loss and damage and monitoring for the  pre-2020 period.  »» Establishes robust processes for detailed  monitoring, review and verification to  ensure transparency and integrity.  »» Ensures a new Periodic Assessment (starting  in 2018 concluding before 2020, and  repeating every five years) that informs the  Paris Ambition Mechanism process.  Canada has an important job to do at home and  in the lead up to the Paris climate negotiations.  Committing to advancing our recommendations  would not only show the world that Canada  cares about protecting the climate and the  people, plants and wildlife that depend on it,  but it would set our country and the world on  a course toward a sustainable future for all.

CAN2015.txt,"Gigatonne gap in the EU pledge for Paris Climate Summit September 2015  Gigatonne gap in the EU pledge for Paris Climate Summit SUMMARY Developing the EU’s emission reduction target for 2030 into a budget similar to the commitments of the EU under the Kyoto Protocol faces a number of challenges. Many elements that will enable us to define that budget are still unclear. Depending on the policy choices that EU Member States will make on the future design of the Emissions Trading Scheme, and  the  policies  to  tackle  all  other  emissions,  including  those  from  the  forestry sector, there will be a substantial difference in the total amount of greenhouse gases the EU will emit in the period 2021 to 2030. The difference between the best and the worst set of decisions is a staggering 6 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This is 30% more than the total greenhouse gas emissions from the EU in 2012.In the most ambitious scenario, average annual emission reductions for the whole period would be around 35% below 1990 emissions. In the least ambitious scenario average annual emission reductions would be less than 25% below 1990 emissions. In this worst case scenario, instead of significantly decreasing emissions, the EU would bring emissions only marginally below its 2020 Kyoto Protocol target of minus 20%. Such a scenario would undermine the EU’s ability to play a leadership role in the international climate negotiations. EU leaders must send a clear message to the world that this scenario is not going to happen. GIGATONNE GAP IN THE EU PLEDGE FOR PARIS CLIMATE SUMMIT2IntroductionIn October 2014, the leaders of the European Union agreed  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  at  least 40% by 20301. This is the proposal the EU also brings to the international negotiations as the follow-up of the EU’s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. However, there is a substantial difference as the EU’s 2030 target is a so-called single-year target, while the Kyoto Protocol targets are multi-year targets, defining emission reductions for a number of years, first for the period 2008 to 2012 and then for the period 2013 to 20202. The EU has not yet defined the emission reductions it wants to achieve in the period 2021 to 2030, and should do so. Because  CO2  and  other  greenhouse  gases  stay  in  the  atmosphere for centuries, they build up over time. This is why it is the total cumulative emissions that matter  to  the  atmosphere  and  that  ultimately  determine  the level of change in our climate. Under a single-year target a country only makes a commitment to reduce emissions  for  the  target  year  but  not  for  the  period  leading up to that target. Under a multi-year target, a  country  makes  a  commitment  to  reduce  emissions  every year of the period between 2021 and 2030.It  is  crucial  for  the  success  of  the  new  international  climate  agreement  to  be  made  in  Paris  that  countries convert their single-year targets into multi-year emission budgets. Hence why it is important for the EU’s credibility that its 2030 target is translated into an  emissions  budget  for  the  period  from  2021  to  2030. This is also the reason why it is vital that this conversion is done in a way that shows leadership and ambition; This  conversion  will  depend  on  a  number  of  deci-sions that EU Member States will take in the coming months and years. Based on the level of ambition that EU ministers and their governments put into these decisions, the conversion of the single-year target in a budget can be very different. Several decisions on how to implement the 2030 target have already been taken by Heads of State and Government, but many important elements have not been decided upon. It will be up to EU policy-makers to take ambitious and bold decisions. Before  converting  the  EU  target  into  a  budget,  the following issues need to be noted:•  While many countries still    need to   finalise their    INDCs, it  is  already clear     that    there is  a gap  between  current  commitments  and  the  action  that  is  needed  to  keep  temperature  rise  below  the  agreed  threshold  of  2°C.  All  countries will therefore need to revise their targets upwards. This is also the case for the EU.  CAN  Europe  considers  the  EU’s  at  least  40%  emission  reduction  target  neither  ambitious nor   fair.    We   continue our   call    for   the EU   to   substantially increase its   2030 target to  at  least  55%.  In  this  paper  however,  we  focus on   analysing the   impact of   the   at  least 40% target;•  The current EU   target runs    till   2030. CAN    calls for   five    year    commitment periods, and    thus 2025 targets, to allow targets to be compared to   progress in   scientific findings on   needed emission reductions;•  The October Council Conclusions and    the EU’s  INDC  are  silent  on  how  emissions  from  international   transport   (aviation   and   shipping)  will  be  reduced.  It  is  essential  that  the  Paris  agreement  addresses  how  and  where  emissions  from  international  transport  will  be   accounted for   and    substantially reduced. In  this  exercise  emissions  from  international  transport  have  not  been  included  in  the  EU’s  carbon budget for 2021 to 2030. Countries decided at the 2012 Climate Summit in Dur-ban that after 2020, a new climate agreement should come into effect which should ensure that all countries commit to climate action. At the 2013 Climate Summit in Warsaw all countries agreed to prepare their initial commitments for greenhouse gas emission reductions after 2020, well ahead of the Climate Summit in Paris in December 2015. These commitments are called IN-DCs: Intended Nationally Determined Contributions. Unfortunately  governments  did  not  come  to  a  substantial agreement on what information should be included in these INDCs. Therefore much work will have to  be  done,  as  part  of  the  Paris  deal,  to  make  these  commitments  quantifiable,  comparable  and  verifiable.  Only  then  will  the  international  community  be  able  to  check  whether  a  country  actually  meets  its  commitments or not. The EU states in its INDC3  from  6  March  2015:  “The EU  and  its  Member  States  are  committed  to  a  binding  target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in green-house gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990, to be fulfilled jointly, as set out in the conclusions by the European Council of October 2014.”4The INDC further clarifies that these reductions need to take place in the EU without the use of international offsets, and indicates that this target will be implemented  through  specific  legislation  on  both  emissions  covered  under  the  Emissions  Trading  Scheme (ETS) and emissions from the non-ETS sectors (which up till 2020 are covered under the Effort Sharing Deci-sion – ESD). While not mentioned in the EU INDC, the October  Council  Conclusions  specify  that  the  reduction target for the ETS will be 43% by 2030 and for the non-ETS sectors it will be 30% by 2030, both com-pared to 2005 emission levels.The INDC is vague on how it will include emissions and removals from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) and states: “Policy on how to include Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry into the 2030 greenhouse  gas  mitigation  framework  will  be  established as soon as technical conditions allow and in any case before 2020”. In other words, LULUCF is to be included in the 2030 policy framework, but it is unclear which baseline will be used (as opposed to the 1990 baseline for all other emissions) and whether emissions and removals from LULUCF will be part of the 40% target. No backsliding The European Union is a strong defender of the ‘no backsliding’ principle. This means that countries’ tar-gets for the period after 2020 should not be less ambitious  than  their  2020  commitments.  Applying  this  principle to the EU, it means we need to compare the current 2030 target with the EU’s commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. The current commitment of the EU is to reduce its emissions by on average 20% in the period 2013 to 2020. Applying this concept of an average 40% reduction for the period 2021 to 2030 would be very different than the linear reduction that is currently assumed in the INDC.As the graph indicates, a Kyoto type target of -40% would reduce total emissions in the EU28 in this period  to  33.8  GtCO2-e,  while  a  linear  reduction  from  -20% in 2020 to -40% in 2030 would allow the EU to emit 5 billion tonnes more.Therefore, in order to judge whether the EU’s target is  not  backsliding,  one  needs  to  calculate  the  exact  budget that the EU will emit between 2021 and 2030. For this to be done, a number of decisions still need to be made. We have calculated the possible EU’s carbon budget in different scenarios. Calculating the EU’s carbon budgetIn the next sections we calculate the EU’s carbon budget for 2021-2030 assuming linear reduction pathways for both the emissions covered by the ETS and those not covered by the ETS. The result of this calculation depends on a number of decisions that still have to be made, and those decisions will define the level of ambition of the EU’s 2021 to 2030 emissions budget. Basically the budget will depend on:•   The total ETS emissions (or ETS allowances) for the period 2021 to 2030;•   The total non-ETS emissions (or non-ETS allowances) for the period 2021 to 2030;•   The decision whether LULUCF will be part of the 40% target;•   The way emissions and removals from LULUCF will be accounted for. Based on the different options to convert the 2030 target into an emission budget we developed three scenarios: a current legislation scenario, a climate pollution scenario, and a climate action scenario Emissions budget under the Emissions Trading SchemeThe ETS covers 45% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions  and  includes  approximately  11  000  factories,  power  plants  and  other  installations.  The  cap  is  reduced annually by a so called Linear Reduction Factor, so the number of available allowances decreases every year. The 2020 ETS target requires reductions of 21% below 2005 levels. The October Council conclusions set the ETS target for 2030 to 43% below 2005 emissions and changed the Linear Reduction Factor from the current 1.74% to 2.2% per year for the period 2021 to 2030. The    EU   is  currently discussing how    it  should reform  its  ETS  for  the  post-2020  period.  In  July   2015, the  European Commission released its proposal for this reform5. For the cumulative emissions budget of the ETS three things matter: 1.  Whether EU   Member States will    continue to allow full carry-over of surplus allowances;2. The size of the surplus that can be carried over; and3.  How much of   the    surplus will    remain in   the Market Stability Reserve at the end of 2030.An  enormous  oversupply  of  unused  allowances  has built  up  in  the  ETS  due  to  a  combination  of  factors,  such as a weak reduction target, the massive use of international offsets, and a static policy design without built-in  adjustments  to  adapt  to  changes  in  demand.  The  current  ETS  legislation  allows  companies  to  carry-over all unused allowances from the period 2013 to  2020  to  the  period  after  2020,  thereby  increasing  the number of available emission allowances in the period between 2021 and 2030. The European Commission expects this surplus to grow to 2.6 billion by 20206, while others such as the UK government project it to be much higher7. In our calculations we use the conservative European Commission’s projection.  Despite  the  fact  that  during  the  negotiations  on  the  second  commitment  period  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol, many countries including the EU expressed concern over an unlimited carry-over of unused emission allowances, the European Commission’s proposal on the reform of the ETS does not limit the carry-over.. Even while it seems unlikely, this as such does not rule out that Member States might still decide that all or part of the surplus should be cancelled. In both the current legislation and climate pollution scenarios we assume full carry-over and no cancellation. In the climate action  scenario  we  assume  that  the  2.6  billion  surplus  ETS allowances will be cancelled.Given the current surplus of emission allowances has lowered the price of carbon to record low levels, the European Union agreed to establish a Market Stability Reserve (MSR) that, in case of oversupply temporarily removes surplus allowances from the market. The MSR will thus take several billions of allowances from the market but these will eventually come back. For all three scenarios, we use Sandbag’s estimates that predict that under the current MSR design around 400 million allowances will remain in the MSR till at least the end of 2030.8Emissions budget for the non-ETS sectorsThe Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) establishes binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for Member States for 2013–2020 for the sectors that are not covered  under  the  ETS.  These  include  transport,  buildings, agriculture and waste. (LULUCF and international transport emissions are currently neither covered under the ETS nor under the ESD.) Legally the ESD comes to an end in 2020 but it is very likely that it will be revised and will continue for the period 2021 to 2030. The October Council Conclusions set the 2030 target for non-ETS emissions to 30% below the 2005 emission level.For  the  cumulative  emissions  budget  of  the  non-ETS sectors two things matter:1. The starting point in 2020; 2.  How  the  surplus  of  unused  emission  allowances from     the   period 2013 to   2020 will    be dealt with.Unlike for the ETS budget, as the ESD ends in 2020, the  starting  point  for  the  calculation  of  the  non-ETS  emissions budget has not been defined yet (see de-tails in annex). If the budget starts from the 2020 ESD emissions target (10% below 2005 levels) the emission  budget  will  likely  be  bigger  than  if  the  starting  point would be at actual emission levels in 2020. This is because actual emissions are projected to be 11% to  15%  below  2005  levels9,  which  is  considerably  lower than the 2020 target. In the climate pollution scenario we assume a 2020 ESD target starting point. In the current legislation scenario we assume that the approach used for the current ESD is copied: a starting point based on the average emissions between 2016 and 2018. In the climate  action  scenario  we  use  a  more  ambitious  starting  point  with  the  lowest  projected  emissions  for 2020.As in the ETS, Member States are projected to over-shoot the ESD 2020 target and therefore accumulate a  surplus  of  ESD  allowances.  The  EEA  projects  the  ESD surplus for the period 2013-2020 to be 700 to 1 950 million allowances10.  This  projection  includes  the full use of offsets, though as most governments will reach their ESD target with domestic measures, it is unlikely that governments will use the full num-ber  of  offsets  they  would  be  allowed  to  use.  We therefore use the most conservative estimate of 700 million surplus allowances. As the Effort Sharing Decision comes to an end in 2020, the legislation does not provide for the carry-over of surplus allowances to the period after 2020. Nevertheless  several  Member  States  have  already stated that they would like to be able to carry over their  surplus.  In  the  current  legislation  and  the  climate  action  scenario  we  assume  no  carry-over  of ESD surplus. In the climate pollution scenario we assume Member States will agree the full carry-over of ESD surplus allowances. LULUCF emissions in the carbon budgetThe 2020 EU climate policy framework does not include  a  target  for  CO2 emissions and removals from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). Non-CO2  emissions  from  agriculture  are  currently  covered  under  the  ESD,  and  CO2  emissions  and  removals  from  certain  LULUCF  activities  are  covered under the EU’s Kyoto Protocol target. The particularity of LULUCF is that the sector includes activities that cause  emissions  but  also  can  lead  to  carbon  being  taken up and stored. Currently LULUCF is a net sink in the EU, i.e. it removes more carbon than it releases. It is projected to remain a sink until 2030 but the sink will probably decline. For  the  EU’s  cumulative  emissions  budget  two  things matter most: 1.  Whether emissions and   removals from    LULUCF will account for reaching the 40% target; 2.  Which accounting rules, and    more particularly  which baselines (or   reference levels), will be   agreed for   the    different activities under LULUCF. The   October   2014   European   Council   Conclusions   provide for the inclusion of the LULUCF sector in the post-2020  climate  and  energy  policy  framework,  but  leave open how this should be done and whether that means LULUCF would contribute to meeting the 40% overall target. Including removals from LULUCF in the overall target would allow the non-LULUCF sectors to increase their emissions.  The  inclusion  would  therefore  reduce  the  need  for  emission  reductions  in  the  non-ETS  sectors.  This  is  especially  troubling  because  emission  reductions in the LULUCF sector can be reversed (e.g. forest fires) and because accurately accounting for these reductions is difficult at best. Therefore LULUCF should be covered under a separate target that will not dilute the level of ambition of the overall target. For the cli-mate  pollution  and  the  current  legislation  scenarios  we assume that LULUCF will be included in the 40% target. In the climate action scenario we assume LULUCF will be kept out of the 40% target.For the two scenarios that would allow for LULUCF to be included in the at least 40% target, the benefit of doing so can be substantially different depending on the  accounting  rules  that  Member  States  will  agree  upon. In the most stringent of five cases with the same human activity but different accounting rules, developed  by  the  Öko-Institut, the LULUCF sector would actually  account  for  annual  emissions  of  17  million  tonnes  of  CO2,  while  in  the  least  stringent  account-ing case LULUCF activities would account for annual removals of 183 million tonnes of CO2 in 2030. For the current legislation scenario we based our numbers on a  case  with  accounting  rules  and  forest  management  reference levels based on the current Kyoto Protocol rules. For the climate pollution scenario, we assumed accounting  rules  that  lead  to  the  weakest  overall emissions budget.The likely, the better and the worstBased on the different options to convert the 2030 target into an emissions budget we developed three  legislation scenarioThis scenario is based on the current rules for the ETS and the ESD: full carry-over of surpluses under the ETS and no carry-over of surpluses under the ESD. It assumes  the  reductions  under  the  ESD  to  start  from  2016-2018 emission levels, equivalent to what was done for the start of the ESD in 2013. It also includes the assumption that LULUCF will be included in the ESD target, with accounting rules similar to those currently used in the Kyoto Protocol.Climate action scenarioThis scenario assumes that EU Member States will take decisions that provide the highest level of climate action, based on the agreed but insufficient 40% target. This includes a decision to fully cancel the ETS surplus and prevent the carry-over of surplus from the ESD. Furthermore reductions for the non-ETS sectors would start from the most ambitious projected emission lev-els for 2020, and emissions and removals from LULUCF would be accounted for in a separate pillar with emissions and removals of the LULUCF sector not diluting the 40% target.Climate pollution scenarioThis scenario assumes EU Member States to go from bad to worse and not only allow the full carry-over of all  unused  allowances  under  the  ETS  but  also  accept  legislation that allows full carry-over of the surplus ESD  emissions.  Moreover,  governments  would  decide  for  the  non-ETS  emissions  budget  to  start  from  the  weak  2020  target,  and  allow  the  full  inclusion  of  removals from LULUCF in this target, while adopting accounting rules with least stringency.The results are quite staggering. The same mi-nus    40%     target in   2030 will    lead    to   average annual reductions for   the   2021-2030 period of only    24%     under the   climate pollution scenario, 27% under the current legislation scenario and    35%    under the   climate action scenario. In terms of actual emissions the climate pollution scenario will    lead    to   almost 43   billion tonnes of  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  whereas  under  the  climate  action  scenario  it  will  be  around  37   billion tonnes. This    means 6  billion tonnes of  a  difference. This    is  30%    more     than    the   EU’s total  emissions  in  2012.  The  table  and  graphs  below show these results in more details.

Care-5.txt,"CARE Climate Change  CARE International's expectations for the 2014 climate talks in Lima, Peru  PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER This paper outlines key issues on the agenda at this year's UN climate talks to be held in Lima, Peru (COP20) and summarises CARE's key expectations.   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A young man looks for his belongings following Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. The typhoon was one of the strongest tropical cyclones to make landfall, destroying lives and livelihoods. Climate change is already exacerbating extreme weather events such as this one. © CARE / Peter Caton  One of the greatest inequalities of our time is reflected in the causes and consequences of climate change, which increasingly threatens the livelihoods of billions of people. However, the world's poorest and most vulnerable, who are least responsible for causing climate change, will unfairly continue to bear the brunt of its impacts. This is an extreme global injustice. If the global community fails to take action, the consequences for humanity, both with regard to food and nutrition security and more broadly, will be devastating. It will further spur humanitarian crises ­ including conflict, disasters and situations of chronic insecurity and vulnerability ­ undermine people's enjoyment of human rights and further exacerbate gender inequality. With this, CARE's vision of a world of hope, tolerance and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and people live in dignity and security will increasingly become impossible to achieve if serious action on climate change is further delayed. This is why CARE believes that policy responses to climate change must also be equitable by contributing to improving the  livelihoods of poor and marginalised people worldwide. The United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference, COP20, which takes place this year in Lima, Peru, is an important milestone in the negotiations towards a new climate change deal to be agreed in Paris at the end of 2015. COP20 comes at the end of a year which has seen intense focus on climate change. Record levels of greenhouse gas emissions, and the unprecedented concentration of atmospheric CO2, which reached 400ppm in 2013, amount to planetary alarm bells. Record-breaking temperatures signal that by the end of 2014, this year may prove to be the hottest on record globally, rubbishing any claims that a ""global warming pause"" might buy us time. The findings of the Fifth Assessment Report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are yet another clarion call to action which shows that past failure to cut emissions and to prepare for climate impacts is already undermining people's efforts to achieve sustainable development around the globe. But the IPCC's findings, approved by nearly all governments, also tell us that avoiding the very worst impacts of climate change is still possible and beneficial. But tackling climate change requires a real and urgent step change in ambition from governments, businesses and societies to address the problem and to find solutions. In essence, it requires a rapid shift away from emissions-intensive development models which cause climate change, particularly in developed countries, which have triggered current levels of warming. This year's UN climate talks (COP20) must be a turning point. Governments have to demonstrate that they are willing to take serious action on climate change and they must succeed in laying the foundations of a progressive climate deal in Paris at COP21 in 2015. Such a deal must begin to correct the fact that some nations have much greater historical responsibility for contributing to the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions, but have taken little climate action so far. The deal must also tackle the issue of climate justice and, most importantly, the fact that those least responsible for climate change suffer its greatest impacts. If COP20 fails to address these critical issues the prospects of achieving an ambitious and effective outcome at COP21 will be dire. In order to get on the path to action, CARE demands that governments at COP20:  development in developing countries by ensuring developed countries pledge USD15 billion to the Green Climate Fund and provide clarity as to how they plan to ramp up public finance up to 2020. 5. Strengthen adaptation and disaster risk reduction by increasing support for national adaptation planning in developing countries and promoting and financing best practice in community-based and gender-equitable adaptation. 6. Progress the international mechanism on loss and damage from climate impacts and help it to become an effective institution to address climate­related loss and damage experienced by those who are most vulnerable to it. Also hold accountable those who have contributed most to global emissions by agreeing an ambitious 2-year work plan, by adopting modalities (including the setting-up of a financial and a technical facility) and by agreeing the composition of the mechanism's governance body. 7. Promote action that strengthens the food and nutrition security and right to food of poor and vulnerable people, and ensures compliance with social and environmental safeguards in activities related to agriculture, land use and forest conservation.  1. Urgently ramp up action to shift away from emissions-intensive development models, by urging all countries to (a) step up their pre-2020 mitigation efforts (particularly developed countries, who also need to support developing countries to do so), (b) ensure global emissions peak before 2020, (c) focus on promoting sustainable renewable energies, (d) promote divestment from fossil fuels and start phasing out coal.  2. Go all out to achieve a strong draft text which forms the basis of a rights-based, fair, ambitious and binding climate deal to be agreed by 2015, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C, phase out emissions and ramp up action on climate change impacts and emergencies (see table 1).  3. Promote gender equality in climate action in decisions taken at this year's COP, and across the UNFCCC, including in the draft 2015 agreement text, climate funds, and national adaptation planning guidelines.  4. Urgently make financial and technical resources available to promote low-emission and climate-resilient    Table 1: CARE's key demands for the 2015 climate change agreement Key demands for the 2015 agreement on a Protocol with legally binding obligations Overarching elements To include: A global vision for a low-carbon and climate-resilient world, where all societies attain sustainable development and prosperity and overcome poverty within planetary boundaries; A clear recognition of countries' common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, including historic and current; A clear call for all parts of society to contribute to a low-carbon and climate resilient world according to their capabilities and responsibilities. Commit to a rights-based, gender-equitable and participatory approach when designing and implementing action on climate change. Clearly recognise that mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage are inextricably linked, and that more mitigation will mean less need for adaptation and less loss and damage. Reducing risks through limiting warming: mitigation and low-emission development Commit to collectively delivering sufficient mitigation in line with a carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C, based on the principles of the Convention, on historic and evolving responsibilities and capabilities, and equity of effort, risk and opportunity sharing. Aim to phase out fossil fuel emissions and achieve a 100% sustainable renewable energy future and access to sustainable energy for all before 2050. Each Party to commit to increase, over time, its climate ambition, without back-tracking, and to deliver minimum commitments at least every 5 years (with longer-term indicative targets) in line with each country's fair carbon budget share. Incentivise and enable leadership and ambition by Parties which are forerunners, such as those with emission phase-out or 100% sustainable renewable energy targets. Reducing risks by preparing for climate change impacts: adaptation Establish an ambitious global adaptation goal based on individual and collective responsibility that (among others) links the level of warming expected from Parties' collective mitigation contributions to the level of support provided to poor countries and communities. Encourage all countries to integrate climate risks into development planning and to prepare national adaptation plans or similar instruments. Regularly communicate national contributions to adaptation. Establish citizen-focussed national monitoring systems. Establish mechanisms to assess progress towards the global goal which take account of the implications of collective mitigation action on national adaptation plans and involve the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and other relevant institutions. Build on the current institutional adaptation architecture and work to increase its impact, particularly when it comes to significantly scaling-up the exchange of knowledge between global, regional, national and sub-national levels and building capacity. Addressing unavoidable impacts: loss and damage Recognise that loss and damage beyond that which can be reduced by mitigation and adaptation needs to be anchored in the 2015 Paris agreement separately from adaptation. Emphasise that past greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of climate change and associated loss and damage. Agree to build on the current Loss and Damage Mechanism, based on responsibilities for past and current emissions, and work to increase its impact, including by providing finance for those suffering loss and damage. Climate finance and other means of implementation Establish global public finance goals (in particular for adaptation and loss and damage) based on historic and evolving responsibilities and capabilities, as an obligation for developed and other capable countries to provide uninterrupted finance for action in vulnerable developing countries, complemented by revenues from other sources such as international transport. Commit to shift (finance and policy) away from fossil fuels and emissions-intensive approaches towards universal and fair access to clean sustainable energy (renewable energy and energy efficiency). Agree to build on the current institutional climate financial architecture and work to increase its impact.

INTRODUCTION Nancy Montero Campos (47) from Unas village near Huancayo, Junín Province, Peru explains how storing and planting native potatoes is helping families to deal with erratic water conditions and boost their income. © Zak Bennett / CARE  In 2015, governments will seek to agree three major international policy frameworks with long-term implications reaching at least to 2030. These include a post-2015 sustainable development framework1, a UN climate change agreement, and a post-2015 framework for disaster risk reduction. The collective ambition of governments agreeing these frameworks will show the world whether they are prepared to take the steps required to prevent further climate disruption which is already undermining efforts to overcome poverty and inequality, or whether the public will have to exert much more pressure on them to do so. COP20 is an important milestone in the negotiations towards a new climate change deal to be agreed next year in Paris. A year ago, CARE's summary of the outcomes of COP19, the UN climate talks held in Warsaw, No surrender to climate chaos, concluded with an outlook for 2014, which we called the ""year of climate ambition"". COP20 comes at the end of a year that has seen intense focus on climate change. Record levels of greenhouse gas emissions, and the unprecedented concentration of atmospheric CO2, which reached 400ppm in 2013, amount to planetary alarm bells. Record-breaking temperatures signal that by the end of 2014, this year may prove to be the hottest on record globally, rubbishing any claims that a ""global warming pause"" might buy us time. The  Fifth Assessment Report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is yet another clarion call to action which shows that past failure to cut emissions and to prepare for climate impacts is already undermining people's efforts to achieve sustainable development around the globe. But the IPCC's findings, approved by nearly all governments, also tell us that avoiding the very worst impacts of climate change is still possible and beneficial. But tackling climate change requires a real and urgent step change in ambition from governments, businesses and societies to address the problem and to find solutions. In essence, it requires a rapid shift away from emissions-intensive development models which cause climate change, particularly in developed countries, which have triggered current levels of warming. It's now clearer than ever that humanity is left with a choice of radical options. On the one hand, not changing course will leave us and future generations with a planet fundamentally damaged by climate change impacts. On the other hand, radically changing production and consumption of energy, and challenging conventional fossil fuel business models, increasingly looks like the only viable option to ensure sustainable development and is actually a far less radical choice than continuing with a business-as-usual approach.    Box 1: Key findings from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Synthesis Report2 · Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climatic changes have had widespread impacts such as retreat of mountain glaciers, ocean acidification, and temperature extremes. · Continued emissions will further increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems, and some risks from climate damage are already unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation. · Climate change is projected to undermine food security; global marine species' redistribution and reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the provision of fisheries productivity. For wheat, rice, and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation is projected to negatively impact production where local temperature increases reach 2 degrees C or more. · Climate change impacts are already making poverty reduction more difficult, and creating new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots of hunger. · Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability and supply, and on food security, including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world. · Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development. · Aggregate economic losses accelerate, and the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits rises, with increasing temperature; there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available. · Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will make it much more difficult to limit warming to below 2 degrees C and will require much higher rates of reduction from 2030 to 2050. · Mankind has already used up most of the carbon in its carbon budget, essentially the amount of carbon that can be released while keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees C; at current rates the remainder of the budget will be used up in less than 30 years. · It is still possible to limit warming to about 1.5 degrees C or maybe even less. To achieve this, greenhouse gas emissions will probably need to be reduced by somewhere between 70% and 95% by 2050. · Adaptation and mitigation are complementary strategies for reducing and managing the risks of climate change. Substantial and immediate emissions reductions can reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation, and contribute to climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development.  1. Cutting emissions: COP20's role in boosting action before 2020 All governments have repeatedly noted in previous COP decisions that there is a clear gap between the emissions reductions actions required to keep average global warming to below 2 degrees C, and ideally to 1.5 degrees C, and the collective level of ambition governments have so far demonstrated to achieve this. This is known as the `emissions gap'. In particular, developed countries now lag far behind the 25-40% emissions reductions required by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) which have been identified as fair and adequate. A recent report from the Overseas Development Institute also reveals the extreme  level of subsidies that many G20 governments are providing to fossil fuel companies for exploration, which is totally inconsistent with required climate action.3 This lack of ambition continues to be a major roadblock to achieving an ambitious global climate change agreement. But the options are now clearly on the table. These include promoting sustainable renewable energy and energy efficiency, forest protection, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and accelerating the shift away from polluting coal-fired power generation by shutting down the least efficient plants first, for example. Also, the IPCC's latest report also highlights that without mitigation, adaptation will increasingly fail (see box 1). This is a key reason why CARE, working with many vulnerable people around the world to build communities' climate resilience, is so concerned about the lack of global ambition to reduce emissions. In progressing along the road to Paris, the UN climate process in 2014 originally hoped to contribute to closing the emissions gap through two key events. Unfortunately, the extraordinary high-level ministerial meetings during the UNFCCC session in Bonn in June 2014 made little substantial progress. The UN climate summit held in September 2014 created significant momentum and resulted in the announcement of several multi-stakeholder action initiatives. However, the UN climate summit fell short of delivering tangible new government commitments for additional action. The Climate Action Tracker concluded that ""the impact of all announcements on global temperature increase is not yet clear, but do not yet present a step change. With current policies we are on track towards 3.7 degrees C.""4 COP20 could make a difference if Parties send the clearest signal possible that the paradigm shift must not begin tomorrow, or in 2020, but right now. The UNFCCC draft decision text on pre-2020 ambition released on 11 November contains some crucial elements in principle. It acknowledges the emissions gap, urges developed countries to increase their 2020 targets and urges developing countries to step up their efforts. It also addresses the obvious need for financial and technical support from developed countries (see section 3). But the decision text needs to go further and should: · State clearly that the objective is for global emissions to peak well before 2020 and decline thereafter, with developed countries taking a leading role. · Explicitly promote sustainable renewable energies and energy efficiency. · Urge countries to make progress on pricing carbon emissions and phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels in a poverty-sensitive manner, and to promote divestment from fossil fuels and start phasing out coal. Governments should also agree to assess the progress they have made towards closing the emissions gap next year. 2. The new 2015 climate treaty: COP20 must move key elements forward In 2011, governments started the negotiation process towards a new global climate change agreement with  new and binding commitments for all countries. This is due to be concluded at COP21, and should come into force no later than 2020. In CARE's view, the new agreement should build on the UNFCCC, including its principles and commitments. It also needs to be fair, legally binding and ambitious enough to allow the world to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Equity must also be a defining parameter. Developed countries have an historic responsibility to take urgent action as they have contributed the most to causing climate change they need to do the most to tackle it. However, a simple twofold approach ­ with developed countries in one camp, and developing countries in the other, does not address the complex reality of the issues. While developed countries are responsible for the majority of historic emissions, the share of global emissions caused by a number of emerging economies has increased significantly in recent years, so limiting global warming sufficiently will require action globally. The good news is that many clean energy and other solutions are now available to deliver internationally and nationally equitable actions to reduce emissions. The second dimension of equity must consider nationally equitable responses that do not undermine the rights of people living in poverty, but rather seek to improve their livelihoods. Overall, CARE is calling for ""language in the 2015 climate agreement that provides that Parties shall, in all climate change related actions, respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights for all"", as stated in an Open Letter from Special Procedures mandate-holders of the Human Rights Council to the Parties of the UNFCCC in October 2014.5 This letter also suggests launching a work programme at COP20 to ensure that human rights are integrated into all aspects of climate action. Governments must leave Lima with a consolidated negotiating text to be used as the basis of the 2015 agreement. It must contain sufficient detail on all of the key elements and it must be ready for countries to consider at least six months before COP21. Work on this text has been the major focus of negotiation sessions this year. CARE's main demands for the 2015 agreement are set out in table 1. Our assessment of the extent to which the current negotiation non-paper released on 11 November 20146 has the potential to deliver on these objectives are represented as colours.    Table 1: CARE's key demands for the 2015 climate change agreement Key demands for the 2015 agreement on a Protocol with legally binding obligations Overarching elements To include: A global vision for a low-carbon and climate-resilient world, where all societies attain sustainable development and prosperity and overcome poverty within planetary boundaries; A clear recognition of countries' common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, including historic and current; A clear call for all parts of society to contribute to a low-carbon and climate resilient world according to their capabilities and responsibilities. Commit to a rights-based, gender-equitable and participatory approach when designing and implementing action on climate change. Clearly recognise that mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage are inextricably linked, and that more mitigation will mean less need for adaptation and less loss and damage. Reducing risks through limiting warming: mitigation and low-emission development Commit to collectively delivering sufficient mitigation in line with a carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C, based on the principles of the Convention, on historic and evolving responsibilities and capabilities, and equity of effort, risk and opportunity sharing. Aim to phase out fossil fuel emissions and achieve a 100% sustainable renewable energy future and access to sustainable energy for all before 2050. Each Party to commit to increase, over time, its climate ambition, without back-tracking, and to deliver minimum commitments at least every 5 years (with longer-term indicative targets) in line with each country's fair carbon budget share. Incentivise and enable leadership and ambition by Parties which are forerunners, such as those with emission phase-out or 100% sustainable renewable energy targets. Reducing risks by preparing for climate change impacts: adaptation Establish an ambitious global adaptation goal based on individual and collective responsibility that (among others) links the level of warming expected from Parties' collective mitigation contributions to the level of support provided to poor countries and communities. Encourage all countries to integrate climate risks into development planning and to prepare national adaptation plans or similar instruments. Regularly communicate national contributions to adaptation. Establish citizen-focussed national monitoring systems. Establish mechanisms to assess progress towards the global goal which take account of the implications of collective mitigation action on national adaptation plans and involve the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and other relevant institutions. Build on the current institutional adaptation architecture and work to increase its impact, particularly when it comes to significantly scaling-up the exchange of knowledge between global, regional, national and sub-national levels and building capacity. Addressing unavoidable impacts: loss and damage Recognise that loss and damage beyond that which can be reduced by mitigation and adaptation needs to be anchored in the 2015 Paris agreement separately from adaptation. Emphasise that past greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of climate change and associated loss and damage. Agree to build on the current Loss and Damage Mechanism, based on responsibilities for past and current emissions, and work to increase its impact, including by providing finance for those suffering loss and damage. Climate finance and other means of implementation Establish global public finance goals (in particular for adaptation and loss and damage) based on historic and evolving responsibilities and capabilities, as an obligation for developed and other capable countries to provide uninterrupted finance for action in vulnerable developing countries, complemented by revenues from other sources such as international transport. Commit to shift (finance and policy) away from fossil fuels and emissions-intensive approaches towards universal and fair access to clean sustainable energy (renewable energy and energy efficiency). Agree to build on the current institutional climate financial architecture and work to increase its impact.  CARE assessment  This assessment is based on the Advanced Durban Platform's (ADP) non-paper issued on 11 November 2014, recognising that nothing in the text is yet agreed by governments. Key to colours used: Red: language is currently missing or very weak. Yellow: addressed in principle but a) at extreme risk because only listed as one option among others or b) should be strengthened. Green: adequately addressed in general terms.    INTENDED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (INDCs) Another key element linked to the negotiations on the post-2020 treaty will be reaching agreement on the key information to be included in intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). INDCs will set out countries' post2020 commitments to limit or reduce emissions (e.g. national absolute reduction targets, or sectoral reduction targets). The European Union's (EU) decisions at the end of October make it the first to move on post-2020 mitigation action. Unfortunately, the agreed 40% reduction target for 2030 (along with insufficient targets for renewable energies and improving energy efficiency) falls short of what the EU needs to do to ensure it takes a fair and adequate share of the burden. Nevertheless, in light of the Paris process, the EU has signalled its openness to scale up. The fact that the USA and China jointly announced indicative post-2020 mitigation targets on 11 November adds momentum to and puts pressure on other major economies to follow suit. However, initial analysis also suggests that the ambition of these announcements lags behind what is possible, what is fair and what is required of both countries to keep the world on a 1.5 degree C pathway.7 So, while as of now there is little reason to be overly optimistic about the courage of most governments, we must still take advantage of domestic pressure and COP20 to raise the bar. That is why agreement in Lima on the key parameters is crucial. All developed countries and other major emitters must deliver truly ambitious post-2020 mitigation action plans by March 2015, clearly spelling out why they think their plans are ambitious, fair and equitable. This must be followed by an in-depth review by independent analysts with a view to identifying the remaining emissions gap in pursuit of a 1.5 degrees C pathway and the actions required to close it. It is increasingly clear that the next global climate agreement can only be successful if developed countries make clear their financial commitments to help developing countries take action. In recent negotiations, developed countries have rejected the inclusion of financial targets in their INDCs, but have not yet provided a clear answer as to how they want to address financial commitments (despite their obligations enshrined in the Convention). This lack of clarity on financial targets currently stands in the way of an agreement on the INDCs in Lima. With regard to adaptation, some developing countries have increasingly pointed to the need to include adaptation in INDCs. Including adaptation in INDCs could definitely strengthen the political standing of  adaptation. However, there is no need to apply the parameters for mitigation contributions, in terms of timing, ambition, comparability and obligation, to contributions for adaptation. Also, preparing adaptation contributions for the INDCs should not delay the delivery of agreement on mitigation contributions in the first quarter of 2015. The current UNFCCC draft text related to INDCs released on 11 November leaves everything open and at the same time lacks clarity.8 To accommodate some of the difficulties that have emerged, Parties could explicitly refer to a longer time frame for agreeing on adaptation contributions (e.g. into 2016 or 2017). A longer time frame could also allow countries to develop these contributions as part of ongoing efforts to develop national adaptation plans (including taking into account the level of warming expected from emissions reductions). Further, the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee could be instructed to provide technical support to help identify adequate national adaptation contributions, and to differentiate between actions which vulnerable countries can undertake independently, and those which require support. COP20 must deliver: · Significant progress on a draft negotiating text towards an ambitious, fair and legally binding 2015 agreement that includes the elements mentioned above. · A decision on the main parameters for INDCs (and the information which governments should submit) which allows a comprehensive equity review of post2020 mitigation pledges in the first half of 2015 with the aim of increasing ambition by COP21, and which encourages the presentation of national adaptation contributions. This must also trigger clarity on the approach to providing financial support for climate action (in particular for adaptation) to developing countries after 2020. 3. Gender equality: time for concerted action ahead of Paris Gender inequality is one of the most widespread and persistent barriers to securing a world of hope, tolerance and social justice. As one of the greatest injustices of our time, climate change amplifies the risks faced by people who are already poor and marginalised, with widespread and negative consequences primarily for women and girls, and for society as a whole. In CARE's view, tackling climate change and reducing gender inequality are not    optional extras. They lie at the core of building a fair and sustainable world and the enjoyment of human rights for all. Commendably, all 2015 climate policy frameworks have entry points for gender equality and empowering women and are now seeking to move action on gender forward. The proposal for the sustainable development goals contains a particularly noteworthy goal on gender equality and women's empowerment.9 Following COP18's landmark `Gender Decision'10, COP19 further strengthened the profile of gender in the context of the UNFCCC, although COP19 did not deliver a clear gender action plan as demanded, for example, by the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA), of which CARE is a member. However, the COP19 conclusions on gender and climate change, and the integration of gender aspects into several COP decisions, builds a basis for moving forward.11 For example, the Least Developed Countries Expert Group is currently finalising a publication on strengthening gender considerations in adaptation planning and implementation in Least Developed Countries.12 With regard to the new 2015 climate agreement, the revised ADP non-paper issued on 11 November contains stronger references than previously to gender (including in the preamble and the sections on adaptation, finance and capacity-building). This is welcome and provides a basis on which to build but will need strengthening.13 Thus, at a minimum, the following entry points should be used to strengthen gender equity further through COP20 decisions: · Including gender equality as a guiding principle for all climate action in the draft negotiation text for the 2015 agreement. · Strengthening gender equality in relevant guidelines for national planning, such as the guidelines for national adaptation plans. · Strengthening gender equality in guidance to institutions such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Adaptation Committee (AC) and the Warsaw Loss and Damage Mechanism, related to the integration of gender equality into their work14, and for the adoption of a comprehensive gender policy and action plan in 2015 in the GCF; · Advancing the monitoring of gender balance, gender budgeting and gender-sensitive climate policies and actions by Parties.  4. Climate finance: achieving USD100 billion by 2020 for climate action A report released recently by the Overseas Development Institute shows that more and more poor countries are investing significant domestic resources in adapting to climate change and preparing for climate-related disasters, despite urgent needs in other areas of poverty reduction and development.15 Investing in adaptation and disaster risk reduction is, of course, indispensable to safeguard development. But it is an extreme injustice that countries which have not caused the climate problem, but are particularly vulnerable to it, need to use their own scarce resources because developed countries provide low levels of climate finance. Developed countries mostly categorise climate finance as official development assistance (ODA). At the same time, many still fail to deliver on their promise of providing 0.7% of gross national income for ODA. This is only one indication of the failure of developed countries to adequately compensate for the impacts caused by past emissions. CARE's key priority is to ensure that funds for adaptation reach those who are most vulnerable in an equitable manner, and that climate finance overall does not exacerbate existing inequalities or undermine the livelihoods of people living in poverty. The pledge from developed countries to mobilise USD100 billion by 2020 for climate action in developing countries has unfortunately not led to a sufficiently strong shift towards more predictable and reliable public finance (as part of overall greater investment in climate action).16 The lack of ambition in climate finance remains a serious problem, creating mistrust and frustration among those fighting for more ambitious policies in developing countries. At COP20, the high-level ministerial meeting on long-term climate finance will be the critical forum for making political progress on defining clear pathways to securing USD100 billion. COP20 will also be important for making progress on other key areas, such as shifting investments away from fossil fuels to sustainable renewable energies and exchanging information on financial instruments to protect those most vulnerable to climate risks. In advance of COP20, there is a real opportunity for developed countries to regain lost trust, in particular by making pledges to the Green Climate Fund. In deciding to allocate 50% of its resources to adaptation, the GCF has taken a major, and positive, step away from current practice. What is needed now is enhanced focus on delivering adaptation resources to help meet the adaptation needs of the most vulnerable communities. UN officials set the benchmark for a successful start at USD10 billion in pledges. Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and developing countries asked for USD15 billion from developed countries as a first step. As of mid-November 2014, USD 7.5 billion has been pledged by a few countries, and a pledging conference to be held on 20 November will heap pressure on countries such as Norway, UK, Australia and Canada, who have not yet pledged anything, to make ambitious announcements. CARE also welcomes contributions to the GCF from countries around the world with growing economic capacity, such as South Korea and Mexico, which have already made pledges in a display of solidarity with countries acutely affected by climate change impacts, and poor communities. Pledging further resources to the UN Adaptation Fund (AF), which in contrast to the GCF is already fully operational, is also important. Achieving the AF's fundraising goal of USD80 million this year would have a strong strategic value, since it would give developing countries confidence that they can continue to use this fund which is already operational. In addition, governments will discuss technical issues on the finance agenda, for example, reports from the Standing Committee on Finance, and the review of financial institutions such as the Green Climate Fund, the Adaptation Fund and the Global Environment Facility.  Thus, CARE's main priorities at COP20 are for more financial and technical resources to be made available to promote low-emission and climate-resilient development in developing countries. In particular: · Developed countries must provide clarity on their plans to scale-up climate finance to USD100 billion (with most of the 100 bn coming from public finance). · Pledges must be made to the Green Climate Fund. They must add up to USD15 billion and contributions to the Adaptation Fund should reach at least USD80 million. · Commitments must be made to shift investments away from fossil fuels towards sustainable renewable energies. 5. Adaptation and Disaster Risk Reduction: strengthening support for vulnerable developing countries The scale of unfolding climate change impacts, and the disproportionate vulnerability of the populations who are least responsible for causing climate change, make a massive adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) response both necessary and urgent. In CARE's view, as an organisation working with many vulnerable communities in adaptation practice, promoting community-based adaptation is of particular importance. It should incorporate interrelated strategies that include the promotion of climate-resilient livelihoods, DRR efforts to reduce the impact of hazards on vulnerable households, capacity development for local civil society and government institutions, and advocacy and social mobilisation to address the underlying causes of vulnerability.17 CARE has been actively engaged in UNFCCC work related to adaptation, the central forum on international cooperation on adaptation and for supporting vulnerable developing countries in their efforts to safeguard development in the face of climate change. Under the UNFCCC, national adaptation plans (NAPs) are an increasingly important tool to help developing countries prepare for expected climate impacts in the longer term. An increasing number of countries have now started to develop such plans, partially supported by the Global Environment Facility.18 From CARE's perspective it is crucial that the NAPs live up to the agreed principles, which include gender-sensitivity, and fully transparent and participatory approaches which take vulnerable communities into account. CARE is also part of a civil society consortium which aims to develop a more operational definition of key principles relevant to NAPs.19 The COP20 agenda includes a discussion on whether the guidelines for preparing NAPs approved in 2011 should be revised. Both submissions by Parties20, and the exchanges among many countries and stakeholders at the NAP Expo held in August 2014 indicate that there is too little experience to justify a full revision of the guidelines. However, a blind spot in the guidelines is the issue of assessing the level of financial support needed to carry out the actions contained in the plans, a notable gap. The costs of adaptation are expected to be huge. NAPs are expected to become the main instrument for providing information about national adaptation activities under the UNFCCC. It would therefore make sense to put a stronger focus on assessing financial needs for NAP implementation and related support. In light of the discussion on INDCs, it would also be useful to discuss how these guidelines can help countries identify potential national adaptation contributions. The Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability (NWP) is an important instrument for furthering understanding among Parties and non-governmental stakeholders of expected impacts, adaptation options and the implications of vulnerability. The Bonn negotiation session in June agreed on the main activities for the next 2-year phase of the work programme. Activities include focusing on good practice and lessons learned in relation to  adaptation planning (including in relation to ecosystems, human settlements, water resources and health), and on processes and structures for linking national and local adaptation planning.21 With the agreement made in June, there is little left for the negotiation agenda in Lima. COP20 will also discuss the Adaptation Committee's report, the main institution involved in promoting a coherent approach to adaptation under the UNFCCC. The report includes recommendations related to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of adaptation, collaboration among UNFCCC institutions and work on NAPs. Of particular importance to CARE are the recommendations of the Adaptation Committee that build on an expert meeting held jointly with the NWP on best practices and needs of local and indigenous communities which took place in April.22 One of the recommendations speaks to institutions funding adaptation ­ such as the Adaptation Fund, the Global Environment Fund and the Green Climate Fund ­ encouraging the integration of local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices into adaptation planning and practices, and M&E. In CARE's experience this is a key approach for delivering adaptation to those most in need, and the COP should push these bodies to take vulnerable communities into account.23 The Adaptation Committee also plans to undertake more work next year to promote effective finance for adaptation.24 An issue emerging from the negotiations on the 2015 agreement, but with potential relevance to both the Nairobi Work Programme and the Adaptation Committee, is the desire by some developing country Parties to advance the assessment and use of standardised metrics for assessing loss and damage, and also to make progress on benefits for adaptation actions.25 Progressing these issues could help to build a better basis for identifying the most effective approaches, which, however, always need to take local circumstances into account. So overall, and in addition to increasing climate finance, COP20 must strengthen adaptation and disaster risk reduction by: · Immediately increasing support for national adaptation planning in developing countries and strengthening NAP guidelines. · Promoting best practice in community-based and gender-equitable adaptation, building on local, indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices. · Considering how to advance the assessment and use of standardised metrics for adaptation.    6. Loss and Damage: COP20 must kick-start the international mechanism Typhoon Haiyan left a strong mark on delegates meeting at COP19 in Warsaw one year ago. Thousands of people died and millions more suffered, despite the Philippines investing considerable funds in disaster preparedness and adaptation. Rarely before has climate-related loss and damage been illustrated so clearly. In CARE's view, loss and damage is the residual impact of climate change resulting both from insufficient mitigation efforts and very real limits to adaptation. Fully addressing loss and damage is crucial from a human rights perspective. Much can be done to reduce loss and damage through adaptation and disaster risk reduction. But the limits to adaptation have also been recognised in the most recent IPCC report (see box 1). Limits to adaptation are generally breached when the expected increase in frequency or severity of catastrophic extreme events overwhelms the ability of countries to cope with damage, undermines their adaptive capacity and resilience and contributes to humanitarian disasters. Limits to adaptation are also breached with slow-onset impacts ­ sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinisation, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification ­ which, slowly or quickly, continue to develop and to which adaptation is in most cases impossible.26 For example, a recent study estimates that the impacts of unmitigated ocean acidification could represent a loss to the world economy of more than USD1 trillion annually by 2100.27 Vulnerable communities in the COP20 host country Peru are already experiencing loss and damage from glacial melting in the Andes (see box 2). With the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) on Loss and Damage, COP19 achieved a landmark in addressing increasing loss and damage from climate impacts, despite the fact that it delivered little more than the bare minimum deemed acceptable by developing countries. Unfortunately, it also lacked reference to countries' historical responsibilities for causing climate change and a meaningful commitment to provide additional financial resources, including the resources to provide rehabilitation and compensation to those who experience loss and damage. Despite this, many developing countries have recently highlighted the importance of the loss and damage mechanism in the context of the negotiations on the 2015 agreement. The Least Developed Countries Group for example has called for specific international cooperation on insurance  and risk transfer systems, assistance and coordination related to climate change displacement, and they have proposed to set up a compensation regime in support of vulnerable developing countries.29 The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) underlined the need to address loss and damage separately from adaptation and to anchor the mechanism in the 2015 agreement.30 Box 2 GLACIAL MELTING, ADAPTATION AND LOSS AND DAMAGE IN CENTRAL PERU Glacial melting is one of the most obvious consequences of climate change in Peru. Given the prospect of reduced water availability due to the rapid retreat of the Huayatapallana glacier, CARE is implementing a community-based adaptation project to expand cultivation of native potato and cereal (quinoa) varieties that require less water than the white potatoes and artichokes currently cultivated. The project also addresses the problem of malnutrition in the region as quinoa has much higher nutritional value than potato. However, as the glacier provides 500,000 people in the region with a significant proportion of their fresh water supply, and because the glacier is expected to completely disappear by 2030, the limits of adaptation and unavoidable loss and damage are foreseeable. The challenge posed by melting glaciers is multiplied across the Andes. Source: CARE International, 201428 At COP20, Parties will discuss the Loss and Damage Mechanism work plan for 2015-2016 based on the work of the Executive Committee in 2014.31 CARE has followed this work closely. Figure 2 presents CARE's understanding of the work plan's key elements in order to address loss and damage in vulnerable segments of the populations and particularly in vulnerable developing countries. The current draft of this plan in principle covers all of the main areas outlined in COP decisions (such as non-economic losses, migration and displacement, comprehensive risk management related to disasters etc., as illustrated in the blue boxes in figure 1). Work on financial instruments, knowledge generation and understanding, and addressing coordination needs can be regarded as cross cutting areas. In figure 1, the link between mitigation and loss and damage has been added in yellow since it is largely absent from the WIM work plan.   The weakest part of the plan is the section on finance, which focuses on ""diffusion of information"" related to financial instruments, and mostly noting examples of instruments which address disasters. However, the work plan should also assess and help developing financial instruments to address slow-onset changes in addition to disasters, which also should take into account financial approaches related to rehabilitation and compensation. Exactly when the Loss and Damage Mechanism will be in a position to clearly address the financial implications of loss and damage is still not clear. At COP20, Parties could however address some of the weaknesses in the Loss and Damage Mechanism work plan by providing additional guidance to the Executive Committee when it starts work. The guidance should include requesting the Executive Committee to take into account the different levels of  loss and damage that will result from varying levels of mitigation ambition and to address loss and damage from slow-onset events when considering financial instruments, as well as the underlying responsibilities for the emissions that are causing climate damage. It should also apply a rights-based approach and analysis across its activities. Finally, in addition to discussing the Loss and Damage Mechanism work plan, COP20 is expected to decide the composition of the Executive Committee, that is, the number of representatives, the country groups or bodies they represent and their mandate. Whatever is decided, those nominated should have a broad range of relevant expertise and include adequate representation from particularly vulnerable developing countries. The need for gender equality    in the composition of the committee should also be clearly stated. As initial meetings of the mechanism have indicated, the need to engage stakeholders should also be clear in the mandate. The proposal from several developing countries to establish a technical facility and a financial facility would be in line with previous decisions. Establishing such facilities would provide a basis for ensuring, over time, that the Loss and Damage Mechanism has the strength to deliver effectively, and have the ability to develop instruments to finance rehabilitation and compensation. Overall, COP20 must make progress on loss and damage by: · Adopting the Warsaw International Mechanism's 2-year work plan (with further guidance to strengthen finance, the link to the levels of expected warming and a rights-based approach), its modalities (including the set-up of a financial and a technical facility) and the composition of the mechanism's governance body. · Anchoring loss and damage in the 2015 agreement draft text. 7. Agriculture and forests: promoting equitable approaches for vulnerable populations The links between agriculture, food and nutrition security and climate change are gaining increased recognition, including in the IPCC's recent report (Box 1). At the same time, agriculture and land-use are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In CARE's view, there is a strong need to safeguard livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and the rights of small and marginalised farmers in the context of a changing climate. While agriculture should in general also contribute to reducing emissions, pressuring small and marginalised farmers to mitigate emissions is not acceptable, since the bulk of the emissions occur elsewhere. In recent years, the UNFCCC negotiations on agriculture have been controversial, mainly because of divergent views on the extent to which developing countries should be expected to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The term `climate-smart agriculture' has been the subject of much discussion and varying interpretations. The June negotiations in  Bonn eventually delivered an agreement among Parties, resulting de facto in a 2-year work programme under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) which will focus on building climate resilience (see table 2). The work programme should also ensure an integrated approach that considers the impacts of climate change on livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and rights in national adaptation plans (NAPs) or as part of countries' nationally determined contributions (INDCs, see above). Table 2: Activities planned under the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) agriculture work programme  Agricultural issues  Activities  Development of early warning systems and contingency plans in relation to extreme weather events and their effects, such as desertification, drought, floods, landslides, storm surges, soil erosion and saline water intrusion.

Source: Based on UNFCCC  Thus, it is unlikely that agriculture will receive much negotiation time in Lima, but will continue to play a role in future negotiations. Regarding forest conservation, COP19 concluded with a set of decisions which outlined the main parameters for promoting Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). A key to the successful implementation of REDD+ is the system for providing information on how biodiversity, social and governance safeguards are addressed and respected. The UNFCCC decisions on REDD+ refer to the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, and take into account relevant international obligations, and the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders. However, there is currently minimal guidance on implementing the system, particularly with regard to reporting safeguards. Without guidance on the timing, frequency and content of reports, there is a real risk that the system for information safeguards (SIS) will fail to ensure that safeguards are addressed and respected. Safeguarding information could become a periodic paper-based exercise masking  significant negative social and environmental impacts and jeopardising the conservation of forests. A number of developing country governments have outlined their initial experience in their submissions and provide suggestions about how to build up an SIS.34 This should serve as a basis for Parties to discuss further guidance on strengthening safeguards at COP20. In turn, this could help to reduce the risk of adverse impacts, including on local communities, and strengthen sustainable development co-benefits, including adaptation outcomes. However, a key challenge continues to be addressing the underlying drivers of deforestation, which cannot be captured through specific projects alone. More integrated action is required to address the drivers of deforestation at national and international levels. Therefore, the main priorities for COP20 are that Parties recognise the need to safeguard livelihoods, food and nutrition security, and the rights of small and marginalised farmers when taking action on climate change in the agricultural sector, and strengthen guidance on the application of safeguards and the associated information systems in REDD+.

It is an issue of justice and inequality for the millions of people and communities around the world who already are experiencing climate harms. It is also an issue for future generations who will suffer increasingly severe loss and damage. The international community's historic and present failures to take urgent action to mitigate climate change is further threatening these rights, especially for vulnerable peoples and communities who are already experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change. However, if the international community acts urgently with ambition and scaled-up resources, it can reduce the very worst climate impacts. As recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Human Rights Council (Council) and numerous scientific bodies and governments, the impacts of climate change - as well as the responses taken to address climate change - are already affecting the enjoyment of fundamental, internationally recognized human rights. In light of these threats, urgent action is required at all levels to minimize and halt the impacts of climate change and to ensure that all solutions enshrine human rights. Thus far, the UNFCCC has been slow to address the human rights dimensions of climate change. With negotiations for the 2015 climate agreement underway, steps are required to deliver: Urgent and ambitious action that effectively limits the average global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius and provides scaled-up support for actions that prioritize the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, including: · Adopt urgent and ambitious mitigation action and provide scaled-up support and resources as a means to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change · Provide compensation for climate-related harms that could not be avoided  Recognition that human rights obligations apply in the context of climate change and must be integrated into the development and implementation of climate policies and solutions, and: · Include reference to the Parties' obligations to protect human rights in all climate actions as a means to ensure consistency and coherence among human rights and climate regimes · Establish safeguards and accountability processes to ensure that climate policies are designed, implemented and monitored in a manner that protects the rights of affected people and communities · Establish a work programme on human rights and climate change to monitor and assess the progress in integrating human rights into all aspects of climate action · Request input from the UN Human Rights Council/ Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights on how to operationalize human rights protections in climate policy Access to information, full and effective participation and access to justice in decision-making processes at all levels, including: · Ensure effective means of participation in decisionmaking at all levels, as critical to effective and sustainable outcomes · Establish a grievance mechanism in the UNFCCC This briefing paper provides an overview of the human rights implications of climate change and the human rights obligations of States relating to climate change. It explores ways in which human rights can be addressed further in the UNFCCC process. The paper also sets out specific recommendations for integrating human rights into the UNFCCC climate regime.   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME Climate change impacts and human rights  Direct climate impacts, such as extreme weather events and rising seas, threaten millions of people in coastal and low-lying areas, while melting snow and ice threaten the security of the indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Loss of freshwater resources and glacial melt put communities at risk in the Andes and the Himalayas. At the same time, intruding seas contaminate groundwater in coastal communities. Ocean acidification and changes in weather patterns alter ecosystems and their capacity to provide goods and services to human communities. Increasing weather extremes constrain food security and access to nutritious forms of food while changing the prices of global commodities, making food more expensive and harder to access  for the world's poorest people. Continuing delays in mitigating climate change mean the costs of adapting to it are increasing, as is the risk of experiencing severe and irreversible loss and damage. A recent UNEP report estimates that adaptation costs in developing countries are two to three times higher than projected in previous studies.i Climate change has exacerbated poverty for vulnerable people around the world - and will continue to do so - even though they are the least responsible for causing it. Figure 1 maps various climate impacts on some of the human rights that are threatened or undermined as a result of these harms.  CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME Actions taken to mitigate or adapt to these climate impacts may also have adverse effects on the lives and livelihoods of people around the world and, in particular, on some of the poorest and most vulnerable communities. For example, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) activities potentially  negatively affect the rights of local communities and indigenous peoples who live in and manage forests; large-scale energy projects can result in communities being forced to leave their homes and ancestral lands without adequate consultation or consent.  Human faces of climate change: impacts of climate change on human rights and food security The Human Rights Council has found that ""climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has adverse implications for the full enjoyment of human rights."" The following stories illustrate the human faces of climate change and serve as a clarion call to governments that the international community must act urgently to protect their rights from severe and irreversible climate harms. · In the Ancash region of Peru, farmers report dramatic changes to their environment. ""The climate has changed a lot. Before there weren't so many insects and it wasn't so hot,"" says Nemezia Villón Ramirez, a local farmer. ""Now we're seeing new pests like white mosquitoes and new illnesses which are destroying our plants. Every year it's getting worse and farmers like me are the hardest hit.""ii · In India, a mother of four children reports that ""now, rainfall is a big problem for our family and for our village, compared to before. So we are now facing lower crop yields and water problems also. We are using most of the crop (paddy) for food consumption. If we have surplus food, then we sell it.""iii · In the Sahel, Harouna Diallo Hamadou Mamoudou (81) reflects on his life experiences. ""I think that irrigation agriculture in the dry season, animal fattening and trade could liberate the region from its precarious state of food insecurity, but unfortunately most of us do not have the means to take up these activities and become less dependent on rain. The future for our next generation is dark and full of uncertainties with the shrinking of pastures, erratic and declining rainfall, malnutrition and multiple human and animal diseases.""iv   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME Human rights obligations in the face of climate change  Under human rights law, States have obligations to protect those whose rights are affected by climate change, with priority given to groups that are particularly vulnerable.v By extension, the UNFCCC, the Council and others have recognized that States must ensure that their responses to climate change do not themselves violate human rights.vi For this reason, climate policies should be designed, implemented and monitored in a manner that protects the full and effective enjoyment of human rights. For example, States must develop national climate policies - such as intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) - through transparent processes that promote the effective participation of all affected communities, including indigenous peoples and other vulnerable populations. It is also important to note that developed countries have responsibilities to assist poorer developing countries in their efforts to respect human rights, which complement developed country obligations under the UNFCCC. In addition to preventing or minimizing harm, a `human rights-based approach' to climate change will contribute to effective outcomes in addressing it. As stated by the Human Rights Council in resolution , ""Human rights obligations and commitments have the potential to inform and strengthen international and national policymaking in the area of climate change, promoting policy coherence, legitimacy and sustainable outcomes."" This approach is critical to achieving such outcomes both in the negotiating process and in the development and implementation of policies and projects on the ground. Through a focus on empowerment, participation and transparency, a human rights-based approach to climate change can help mobilize society and press for sustainable outcomes. Basic human rights--such as the rights to access to information and full and effective participation in decision-making--increase support for, and public ownership of, climate policies. A rights-based approach also helps to clarify who is responsible for the delivery of key changes and, thus, who can be held accountable where this does not happen or when people are harmed by the actions of those in power. As recognized by the Council, the ""effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by those segments of the population who are already in vulnerable situations owing to factors such as  geography, poverty, gender, age, indigenous or minority status and disability."" A rights-based approach will focus on those populations who suffer the disproportionate impacts of climate change and help to bring attention to systemic issues, like inequality, discrimination and exclusion. Current status of human rights in the UNFCCC The link between human rights and climate change is well recognized by UN human rights bodies, but has received very limited recognition in the UNFCCC negotiations. The UN Human Rights Council has shown significant leadership on this issue. For example, in 2008, it adopted the first of three resolutions on human rights and climate change, stating that climate change ""poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights."" Building on this important recognition, in the 2010 Cancun Agreements, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC took an initial step towards integrating human rights in the climate framework. For the first time, the UNFCCC recognized that rights obligations apply in the context of climate change, stating that, ""Parties should, in all climate-related actions, fully respect human rights.""vii Notably, the same decision also established the rights-based safeguards to be applied when financing and undertaking REDD+ activities.viii However, since 2010, the UNFCCC has made minimal progress in operationalizing rights protections. There have been incremental developments in REDD+ to integrate further rights protections. These include the COP deciding that information on social, environmental and governance safeguard policies should be included in national communicationsix and that payments for results cannot occur without information showing that such safeguards are being addressed and respected.x However, for the most part, the Parties have not taken the necessary steps to ensure that human rights principles guide the development and implementation of the climate policies, institutions, mechanisms and solutions established under the UNFCCC.xi Much more work is needed to put human rights on both the political and   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME negotiating agendas, as evidenced at the most recent COP held in December 2014. In the final days of negotiations, some Parties called for references to human rights, the rights of indigenous peoples and gender equality to be included in the 2015 climate agreement. Despite these interventions and various submissions by UN Special Procedures and civil society organizations calling for human rights to be integrated fully in the climate framework, the draft negotiating text includes only one reference to rights in the preamble paragraphs.xii Moving beyond the UNFCCC, however, there have been important advances in integrating rights in climate funds and institutions. Some REDD+ initiatives have developed policies and guidance to operationalize rights and achieve consistency with the UNFCCC REDD+ safeguards. For example, the UN-REDD Programme has adopted guidance for implementing the right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) and the UNREDD Programme and the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility have adopted joint guidelines on stakeholder engagement.xiii In addition, at least two climate funds address human rights (to varying degrees) in their operational policies. The Adaptation Fund's (AF) Environmental and Social Policy provides that, ""AF supported programmes, projects and other activities shall respect and, where applicable, promote international human rights.""xiv The Green Climate Fund's (GCF's) interim environmental and social safeguards - the Performance Standards of the International Finance Corporation - while controversial, contain some references to human rights, including FPIC in certain circumstances.xv Policy recommendations for integrating human rights in the climate regime While the UNFCCC has recognized the need to respect human rights in all climate-related actions, it has yet to implement this approach in practice. Much more work is needed to integrate human rights fully into the post2020 climate regime. The International Bar Association (IBA) recently released a report that provides a comprehensive survey of existing legal frameworks relevant to climate change and identifies opportunities for the legal, regulatory and institutional reforms needed to address climate change effectively.xvi Further, in December 2014, 76 independent experts (known as Special Procedures) of the Human Rights Council issued a statement, calling on the Parties to the UNFCCC to integrate human rights standards and principles in the climate change negotiations.xvii  The following recommendations incorporate proposals made by the IBA and the Special Procedures, among others: Objective 1: Urgent and ambitious mitigation action that effectively limits the average global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to prevent severe and irreversible harm and provides scaled-up support for actions that prioritize the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable Recommendation 1: Adopt urgent and ambitious mitigation action and provide scaled-up support and resources as means of preventing the most catastrophic impacts of climate change Based on an overwhelming body of scientific evidence, it is evident that the Parties to the UNFCCC must take urgent action to avoid severe human harms caused by climate change. In doing so, the Parties must consider human rights as a minimum threshold in determining and delivering the level of ambition needed. This includes: (1) a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels based on procedures for equitable commitments by all Parties; (2) an increase in pre-2020 mitigation efforts; and (3) significantly scaled-up support for both mitigation and adaptation actions, especially for those vulnerable populations in developing countries. Recommendation 2: Provide compensation for climate-related harms that could not be avoided Severe damage and irreversible losses from climate impacts can be avoided no longer. Such loss and damage to lives, livelihoods, property and culture threaten the human rights of the individuals and communities most vulnerable to, but least responsible for, climate change. As agreed in Doha in 2012, the Parties have established a mechanism to address loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change in highly vulnerable countries. Recognizing their obligations to compensate those who have already been affected by climate change, the Parties should develop a means to provide compensation for those who already are experiencing loss and damage.   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME 8 Objective 2: Recognition that human rights obligations apply in the context of climate change and must be integrated fully into the development and implementation of climate policies and solutions Recommendation 3: Include a reference to the Parties' obligations to protect human rights in all climate actions as a means to ensure consistency and coherence among human rights and climate regimes Building on the language already agreed by Parties to the UNFCCC in the Cancun Agreements, the general principles of the 2015 climate agreement should include: ""Parties shall, in all climate change related action, respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights for all"" This language, which is supported by the UN Special Procedures, is critical to ensure that the international community's responses to climate change do not cause further environmental and human harm. However, it is important to note that this language reflects the Parties' existing obligations to protect human rights. Additional language is needed in the operational elements of the agreement to apply a human rights-based approach in the development and implementation of climate policies, mechanisms and institutions established under the UNFCCC (see below). Recommendation 4: Establish safeguards and accountability processes to ensure that climate policies are designed, implemented and monitored in a manner that protects the rights of affected people and communities As a means to operationalize their existing rights obligations, the Parties must take necessary precautions to ensure that actions to address climate change do not come at the expense of people and communities. To do so, the UNFCCC must consider how to integrate rights considerations in the development and implementation of climate policies, in part through the design of institutional safeguard systems that apply to all policies, mechanisms and institutions established under the UNFCCC. Such examples include the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and other market-based mechanisms, REDD+ initiatives, technology transfer and the loss and damage mechanism. The key elements of an institutional safeguard system include four components 1. Social and environmental safeguard policies 2. Monitoring systems to ensure that safeguards are being respected 3. Grievance mechanisms to ensure that affected peoples and communities can raise their concerns and have them addressed in a timely manner 4. Opportunities for meaningful and effective participation in all stages of relevant decision-making processes Within the context of REDD+, some initiatives have adopted a rights-based approach. In particular, the UN Development Programme has recently adopted a comprehensive set of policies - including social and environmental policies and a project-level screening procedure - that could serve as a useful model in developing a safeguards system within the UNFCCC.   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME 9 With respect to monitoring and reporting at the national level, the Parties must report on the human rights implications of climate change and climate policies as well as the steps they have taken to address these impacts. Such reports should be made in national communications and biennial reports/biennial update reports or any other reporting processes established under the new agreement. Relevant information should include national laws and policies effectively implementing relevant safeguards or rights protections, as well as the status of their implementation. Developing countries, particularly those with less capacity, should be supported in the efforts required to generate such reports. Countries should draw on existing reporting processes to avoid duplication. Recommendation 5: Establish a work programme on human rights and climate change to monitor and assess the progress in integrating human rights into all aspects of climate action As proposed by the UN Special Procedures, the Parties should establish a work programme on human rights and climate change to put this issue squarely on the COP agenda. A work programme, reporting to the COP, would provide a much-needed opportunity for delegates to have a focused dialogue on what efforts have been made thus far and what more needs to be done to protect the rights of those most vulnerable, but least responsible for climate change. In December 2015, the Parties should adopt a decision establishing the mandate as well as the objectives and activities to be undertaken by the work programme (similar to the approach taken with the work programme on REDD finance). The primary purpose of this work programme would be to monitor and assess what actions are needed to integrate human rights fully into climate policymaking. It would also provide a means for exchanging best practices and furthering understanding of what actions can be taken to address the human rights impacts of climate change faced by all countries. Recommendation 6: Request input from the UN Human Rights Council/Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights on how to operationalize human rights protections in climate policy In determining what actions are needed to protect human rights fully in the climate framework, it would be useful for the UNFCCC - in consultation with human rights experts as well as civil society - to conduct a study where it considers what it means to apply a human rights-based approach to climate change. Once established, the work programme could initiate a consultative study and in-session workshops as mechanisms for sharing ideas and best practices on ways to operationalize human rights in the climate regime. In particular, the work programme could request input or guidance from those with long-standing expertise in this area, notably the UN Human Rights Council and the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR), among other human rights experts. Alternatively, the Parties to the UNFCCC could request that the OHCHR conduct such a study. Either approach would help to ensure consistency and coherence between the two regimes and would provide legitimacy to the work being undertaken by the UNFCCC.   CLIMATE CHANGE: TACKLING THE GREATEST HUMAN RIGHTS CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME 10 Objective 3: Access to information, full and effective participation, and access to justice in decision-making processes at all levels Recommendation 7: Ensure effective means of participation in decision-making at all levels, as critical to effective and sustainable outcomes In the 2015 agreement, the Parties to the UNFCCC must promote and strengthen the means for equitable participation at all stages of the decision-making process (development, implementation and monitoring/ reporting) and at all levels (local, regional, national and international). It should explicitly affirm the rights of access to information, full and effective participation and access to justice in reference to all climate action. For example, at the international level, the public should be involved in the development of the intended, nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to be submitted in 2015. The UNFCCC must also recognize the need for the full and effective participation of stakeholders in the development and implementation of institutions and processes under the UNFCCC and related instruments/ bodies (e.g. GCF, Adaptation Board, CDM and institutional arrangements to address loss and damage). In the negotiations under the GCF, observers face serious obstacles with respect to access and participation - including lack of adequate notification of meeting dates and draft documents. It is clear that much work is needed to ensure that rights are protected in the GCF. With respect to monitoring and reporting, the UNFCCC must ensure effective means of participation within processes for measurement, reporting and verification and in the ex-ante review (assessment of INDCs). This includes the ability of observers to provide information for consideration in national communications and biennial reports, and to participate in the review processes. Recommendation 8: Establish a grievance mechanism in the UNFCCC The Parties to the UNFCCC should establish a grievance mechanism to ensure that those negatively affected by mitigation and adaptation activities can raise their concerns and have them addressed in a timely manner. Grievance mechanisms - such as the International Finance Corporation's Compliance Advisor Ombudsman or the UNDP's Compliance Review and Grievance Processes - are tested tools in helping institutions minimize harm to communities and ecosystems by protecting existing rights, obligations and standards. By facilitating transparency and stakeholder participation, grievance mechanisms also help to ensure that policies and projects are legitimate and effective, and promote sustainable development. In the coming years, the UNFCCC must establish a grievance mechanism to which individuals, peoples, or communities (or their representatives) whose rights may be affected by the implementation of climate actions can submit relevant information. The mechanism should assess the impacts of the climate actions on the affected peoples or communities, including on their enjoyment of human rights. Such mechanisms should recommend measures for preventing or minimizing harmful effects and for ensuring that the response measures do not interfere with their enjoyment of their rights. In addition, the mechanism should be available to assist policymakers in safeguarding human rights and in implementing the recommended measures.    "

WHAT WE NEED FROM GOVERNMENTS AT COP21:  1.5°C  EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS Limit global warming to below 1.5°C. Phase out the use of fossil fuels. Increase the use of renewable energy.  SCALING-UP ADAPTATION  $  Massively increase financial and other support to catalyse adaptation action at a scale needed to substantially reduce future  losses and damages.  ADDRESS LOSS AND DAMAGE: Anchor Loss and Damage, its mechanism and financial and technical support in the Paris agreement, and promote immediate action.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  With the current global average temperature now at around 1°C above pre-industrial levels, poor people in developing countries are already suffering devastation from climate change impacts. It is therefore critical and urgent for vulnerable countries and communities to adapt to climate change impacts. Being prepared for changes in climate and severe weather events can reduce the impacts on people's lives, their livelihoods and food security. For too long, however, action in cutting emissions and scaling-up adaptation has been utterly inadequate. As a result, more and more of these impacts are exceeding people's ability to adapt. Loss and damage is therefore now part of the reality of climate change, and must be tackled. Loss is often understood as irreversible (e.g. loss of lives, species or habitats), while damages can be repaired (such as roads, embankments etc.). If the planet undergoes 2°-3°C of warming, which is a possibility with current national climate pledges ­ known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) - on the table, the scale of loss and damage will be catastrophic. As past greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change and associated loss and damage, historic responsibilities for these emissions must be taken into account when it comes to providing financial and technical means to those countries and communities most affected, and least responsible for global warming. This is a matter of justice and human rights.  alone issue in a separate article, including establishing a link to mitigation and adaptation efforts, which impact on the level of loss and damage; · Reflecting the need for additional financial and technical support to be provided primarily by the countries most responsible for causing the problem, but taking into account evolving responsibilities over time; · Ensuring that institutional arrangements under the Paris Agreement have a mandate to further strengthen work on addressing loss and damage as the problem evolves (building on, but not limited to, the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)). 3. Strengthen the Warsaw International Mechanism by: · Deciding that its work will continue beyond the planned 2016 review. · Exploring and establishing financial instruments. (The first step must be to establish a financial panel with a mandate to make recommendations to ensure finance flows to support vulnerable communities facing the worst impacts).  In the UN climate regime, governments have taken their first steps to address loss and damage, resulting in the establishment of the so-called Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM) which has started to work on a range of issues. These include understanding non-economic losses to the impacts of slow-onset events such as sea-level rise, to addressing climate-induced human mobility, and developing financial instruments for dealing with loss and damage. The knowledge and experience gathered through the WIM can form the basis of action to address loss and damage in the new global climate agreement. World leaders, as well as businesses and communities, must rapidly increase their efforts to cut emissions and help people deal with their changing climate. The negotiations for a long-term durable and dynamic treaty, the Paris Agreement, must ensure that the international community's response to climate change in the 21st century can adequately address loss and damage. Therefore, the Paris Agreement must: 1. Reduce the incidence of loss and damage by: · Enshrining the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and establishing key underpinning mechanisms such as a emissions phase-out goal by 2050 at the latest, and 5 year successive commitment cycles;  · Promoting additional concrete actions to assist the poorest and most vulnerable in facing loss and damage (e.g. the development of redress schemes, adequate regional insurance approaches, building resilience of social safety nets, generation of finance from highly responsible companies, etc.) · Coordinating and developing legal and policy frameworks for particular types of loss and damage, for example climate displacement and migration. Exploring the role of a coordination facility, as well as addressing non-economic losses, could contribute towards this. · Providing for full and effective public participation in the work of the mechanism, particularly by the communities most affected by loss and damage and their representatives. Overall, governments must adopt a bold way forward on loss and damage in the Paris Agreement, to ensure that the issue has permanence and durability under the new framework.  · Scaling-up adaptation actions including through massively increasing financial and other support; and  2.

CLIMATE CHANGE INDUCED LOSS AND DAMAGE: WHY IT MATTERS  Bineta Fall was one of the last farmers on the island of Baout in Senegal, until rising sea levels made soils too salty for growing rice   Bineta Fall used to grow rice on the island of Baout, in Senegal. But rising sea levels have flooded her island's rice fields so much that Bineta and every other farmer on the island have been forced to abandon farming altogether.  loss of lives, species or habitats), while damages can be repaired (such as roads, embankments etc.). There will be both economic and non-economic losses1, and these losses will require both economic and non-economic measures to address them.  ""There is no more agriculture here. It is too salty,"" Bineta says regretfully. A determined and dedicated farmer, she was the last person on the island to give up growing rice. Now the community is entirely dependent on the sea for their food and livelihoods. Bineta sells fish. But without agriculture to provide for part of their needs, they admit they have little choice but to overfish their local marine ecosystems, and catches are getting smaller. Almost all the men on the island now fish for a living. But they need to stay longer and go further out to sea to find the catches necessary for their livelihoods. As a result, more lives are being lost at sea. With water levels flooding the village and rising faster every year, the islanders are not even sure what will become of their homes or island in years to come. On a neighbouring island, Diamniadio, village elder Seny Sarr shares the same worries. ""Each year the sea water comes higher. This year it will probably come into the village itself. Where will we be in 50 years if these sea levels continue to rise? Only God knows.""  The year 2015 has seen severe humanitarian consequences as a result of increasingly erratic weather patterns. The extreme heat waves in India and Pakistan in May and June led to the deaths of approximately 3,600 people.2 The Amazon ecosystem suffered its worst drought in 80 years. And more than 1 million people were affected by flooding in Myanmar, with over 1 million acres of farmland inundated and more than 15,000 houses destroyed3. While not all of these events can be blamed on climate change alone, there is increasing certainty that man-made climate change is worsening the frequency and severity of these events, and that the damage is already being done. A recent study investigating 29 extreme weather events occurring in 2014 confirmed that many were significantly influenced by climate change. Researchers concluded that ""as the science of event attribution continues to advance, so too will our ability to detect and distinguish the effects of long-term climate change and natural variability on individual extreme events."" Bineta Fall's fate is only one illustration of what thousands of vulnerable communities in developing countries already face. Loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change is a reality today. Loss is often understood as irreversible (e.g. Loss and Damage: Climate Reality in the 21st Century · pg VANUATU: PROTECTING LIVES AMIDST UNPRECEDENTED DAMAGES Cyclone Pam, a Category Five cyclone, was one of the worst storms ever to hit the Pacific region when it struck in March 2015. It destroyed or damaged an estimated 80 ­ 90 % of structures and buildings and resulted in direct costs of around US$350 million throughout the Pacific islands.5 The disaster also wiped out crops, leading to on-going food shortages.6 However, due to effective early warning systems, Cyclone Pam caused relatively few deaths. ""We told everyone that a cyclone was coming, and that everyone should prepare. People tied down their roofing, cut the top off their manioc and banana plants to protect them, and prepared food and water for their families. [...]Even though Cyclone Pam was much stronger than previous cyclones, this time there were no deaths and no serious injuries [in this community]. Personally I think that if we hadn't had the training from CARE, we would have lost several families."" (Philip Thomas, Community Disaster Committee coordinator)7 ""When the wind finally went down, the Community Disaster Committee went and checked on all the safehouses. Some had been badly damaged. The church was broken, one strong home had lost its iron sheet roof, and the school building had been torn apart. Those who had been taking shelter in the school building had had to move to a nearby teacher's house during the night, but no one was hurt. In the whole community there were no serious injuries or deaths."" (Mini Natango, community member)8 Loss and Damage: Climate Reality in the 21st Century · pg  ADAPTATION CAN REDUCE LOSSES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS Adapting to climate change is critical for countries and communities. Being prepared for changes in climate and severe weather events can reduce the impacts on people's lives, their livelihoods and food security (see also Box 1). However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recognised that there are physical and economic limits to adaptation, especially where climate change impacts are  significant.9 Sometimes the impact will be so severe that countries and communities will simply be unable to adapt, either because the world has failed to sufficiently reduce emissions, or because they have not had the support needed to adequately prepare.10 In 2013, the Philippines was already investing significant resources into disaster risk reduction (DRR). However, when Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Typhoon Yolanda) struck, its impacts were so extreme that it caused massive destruction and loss of life. (See case study). An increased number of cases where climate change impacts exceed the ability of a community to adapt can be expected in the future.  TYPHOON HAIYAN   Super Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines on the 8th November 2013. Winds of up to 380 kph made Haiyan the strongest typhoon ever to make landfall. Coupled with heavy rains and storm surges, Haiyan razed entire villages to the ground,11 destroyed buildings, roads, infrastructure and crops, and killed thousands of people. Over 6,200 people were confirmed dead; 28,600 people were injured in the event, and more than 4.1 million displaced. Over 1.1 million homes were damaged, and at least 550,000 totally destroyed. Some 5.9 million workers in nine different regions were affected, with sources of livelihood and income destroyed, lost or disrupted.  Now, after two years of relief, rebuilding and reconstruction, communities are starting to see hope for the future again. Many have regained access to basic services and markets. Children are back in school, industries have resumed operations, and plantations are rehabilitated.  The typhoon also shook UNFCCC climate negotiations in Warsaw when the chief negotiator for the Philippines made the following poignant remarks to the conference:  ""What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness. The climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness. [...] We cannot sit and stay helpless staring at this international climate stalemate. It is now time to take action. We need an emergency climate pathway."" (Yeb Sano, Philippines, 11 Nov 2013) WHEN LIMITS TO ADAPTATION ARE EXCEEDED, LOSS AND DAMAGE AFFECTS THE POOR There is no internationally agreed definition of loss and damage from climate change, but there is an emerging understanding that it relates to those impacts that cannot be avoided through mitigation and adaptation efforts.13 Limits to adaptation can be breached when catastrophic extreme events resulting from climate change become increasingly severe or frequent, such as severe cyclones, storms or droughts. It can also prove impossible to adapt to slow-onset impacts that continue to develop, and which leave territories uninhabitable and unproductive. Rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinisation, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity, and desertification are all major challenges to adaptation efforts. Adaptation will become impossible on low-lying islands, in settlements close to sea level, and in the most arid regions, as communities will suffer permanent loss of lands, livelihoods and cultural resources if global warming is not sufficiently contained. Permanent loss and damage from slow-onset disasters goes far beyond economic loss. In addition to losing their livelihoods and homes, communities suffer important non-economic losses if they must lose their culture, community and social structures.14 15 Some examples illustrating the difference between adaptation and loss and damage include: · When mountain glaciers melt, the community may adapt by building or strengthening dykes to contain the glacial lake, and by increasing the ability of surrounding  landscapes to hold the water recharge, such as through reforestation. However when glacial lakes burst (for example through a sudden breaking-up of large glacial pieces), even with an effective early warning system the resulting floods can cause loss and damage by destroying homes, harvests, or loss of life. · When sea-levels rise, dykes can, in some cases, protect the land and help communities to adapt. However, in many cases, land will be permanently lost underwater, or inundated with salt, leaving soils too salty for agriculture, and salinating freshwater reservoirs. · When a heavy storm strikes, stronger houses, community shelters, and storage for water and food may be able to withstand the impacts. However, these may still be overwhelmed by extreme storm events resulting in loss of life, livelihoods, harvests, etc. Climate change may also cause storms in areas which have not experienced them before, and which are therefore unprepared to cope. · Rising temperatures, drought and erratic rainfall will lead to major crop losses, proving disastrous for developing countries and communities whose economies are largely dependent on agriculture. Some farmers and farming systems may find innovative ways to adapt, for example through improving their soils' water carrying capacity, increasing their locally-adapted crop diversity, using early warning systems to time planting and harvests, or through building dykes to protect from floods and rising sea levels. However, above certain temperatures, crops will fail to pollinate or set seed, rain will fail to arrive, and lands may even turn to desert, resulting in permanent loss of livelihoods. GLACIER MELTING IN NEPAL The Himalayan Glaciers form an important source of fresh water for millions of people living downstream, providing water for hydropower, agriculture, irrigation and domestic purposes. The glaciers are the main source of water for the river systems in the region. But in the last 30-year period from 1963-1993, the glaciers in Nepal have retreated in volume by nearly 8%16. The IPCC 5th Assessment Report has also confirmed a further decline in the first decade of the 21st century for high mountain areas in Asia.17 Glacial retreat is a key indicator of climate change. Accelerating glacial retreat signals that rapid climate change is taking place, leading to the formation of new glacial lakes and supra-glacial lakes. Over time, and due to the rapid melting of glaciers, these glacial lakes increase in size and retain higher volumes of water around natural moraine dams. These dams can suddenly and catastrophically release with massive volumes of water forming glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Such events threaten people living downstream, causing economic and social losses and damages. They may wipe out entire settlements from the map, forcing people to migrate from the place they call home. Nepal has experienced 24 GLOF events since 1964,18 which has resulted in both economic losses and casualties. The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has identified 20 potentially vulnerable glacial lakes in the Himalayan region of Nepal. The only means to reduce the threat to communities from GLOFs is to manage the volumes of water in these glacial lakes. However, there are major challenges in implementing these measures, such as limited accessibility (sites are only accessible in certain seasons), inhabitability for people to stay there due to high elevation (4500 metres or more above sea level), lack of resources to survive, and the high costs of long -term risk reduction measures. Nepal is, according to UN definitions, a Least Developed Country (LDC), and has barely contributed to global warming. Nor does it have the massive financial resources needed to cope with the impacts of climate change. The country must rely on the support of the international community; but this often only arrives in the wake of a disaster. (The April 2015 earthquake, which devastated many regions of Nepal, illustrates the complexity in ensuring resilience and development in a country that is vulnerable to both climate and nonclimate hazards.) Loss and damage, which goes beyond adaptation, is therefore a critical issue for the Himalayas. The fragile Himalayan ecosystem of Nepal has more than 30 million people living downstream of glaciers. There have already been significant investments in the country's economy, and more will be made in the future. Major climate hazards such as GLOFs pose a serious risk to these substantial investments, to the country's social capital, and to those communities who live near the glaciers. Loss and Damage: Climate Reality in the 21st Century · pg  2. LOSS AND DAMAGE: WHAT SCIENCE TELLS US ABOUT THE FUTURE  At an average global temperature rise over 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels, the aggregate risks associated with climate change increase significantly (figure 1). More than 1governments and many in civil society are therefore calling for global action to ensure that warming is limited to no more than 1.5°C. It is therefore extremely worrying that the world is currently on a path towards a much warmer world. A global average temperature rise of well over 4°C from pre-industrial levels by the end of this century is a real risk if business-as-usual emission trends continue.21 The possibility of 5°C or even 6°C of warming by 2100 cannot be ruled out.22 Average global temperature increases can disguise far higher extremes in reality, as some large land masses will heat more than others. An increase of 4°C or 5°C in average global warming would in fact mean much higher temperature increases over land masses such as Africa.23 Recent government pledges for national climate action, known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), have started to narrow the gap between business as usual and the level of action needed to avoid dangerous global warming. But current  INDCs still leave the world on a pathway for approximately 2.7 ­ 3.4°C. Far greater mitigation efforts are required in the next few years to avoid locking in a level of low ambition that is likely to produce significant amounts of loss and damage.24 The IPCC has identified a number of severe risks from climate change that will harm human and ecological well-being, including: · For low-lying coastal zones and SIDs storm surges, coastal flooding and sea level rise greatly increase the risk of death, injury, ill-health, disrupted livelihoods, and loss of territory and ecosystems.  Loss and Damage: Climate Reality in the 21st Century · pg  · High risks for rural livelihoods, food security and agricultural productivity linked to drought, flooding and extreme heat. · Systemic risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and emergency services.25 · Extensive biodiversity loss with associated loss of ecosystem goods and services. · The above risks grow disproportionately as the average temperature rise increases from 1°C to 2°C. These events become ""high risk"" at above 3°C warming, due to the potential for a large and irreversible sea level rise from ice sheet loss.  This risk increase also translates into higher economic costs for adaptation and loss and damage (also known as ""residual damage""), according to projections covering a range of impacts. For a temperature increase scenario of 4°C by the end of the century, the adaptation costs in developing countries in the next decades are expected to be significantly higher than at a scenario of 2°C (see figure 2). Loss and damage costs increase as a consequence of inadequate adaptation. The UNEP Adaptation Gap Report suggests costs for the Least Developed Countries alone might be in the range of USD 50 billion per year by .  These risks emerge in a world where there is already a huge gap in adaptation action and economic capacity to take such action, particularly in developing countries, due to widespread poverty, social and economic inequalities including gender inequality, lack of institutional capacity, and insufficient support from developed countries to help poor countries adapt to climate impacts.28 However, there is no lack of proposals for adaptation action. Two climate funds under the UNFCCC ­ the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Adaptation Fund ­ have a long list of  projects, collectively worth around US$300 million, which could be implemented immediately, but which are on hold as no money is available. At the same time, evidence shows that adaptation projects can have significant development benefits, as they often seek to bring climate resilience to key areas of development such food and nutrition security or water supplies. Thus climate change brings a triple burden: higher adaptation costs with higher temperatures, higher losses, and foregone development benefits due to inadequate and delayed adaptation.  3. LOSS AND DAMAGE UNDER THE UNFCCC: FIRST STEPS IN A LONG JOURNEY   In principle, the responses required to reduce loss and damage are clear: 1. Cut global greenhouse gas emissions urgently and sufficiently to limit global warming to 1.5°C, in order to reduce the long-term risks; and 2. Scale-up adaptation, disaster risk reduction and climate-resilient sustainable development to better prepare vulnerable communities and countries for climate change impacts and thereby reduce loss and damage. 29 However, for too long action in both of these areas has been utterly inadequate. As a result, loss and damage is now part of the reality of climate change, and must be tackled. As climate change impacts felt today are a result of cumulative greenhouse gas  emissions released over the last century or more, responsibility to address the problem ­ or to support vulnerable countries to address loss and damage, including for rehabilitation ­ should be informed by historic emissions. Up until now the driving forces of climate change, and the resulting loss and damage, have been overwhelmingly caused by a minority of wealthier countries on this planet which means they have a particular responsibility to provide financial and technical means to poorer countries. As this picture of historical responsibility will further evolve in the future as different countries industrialise, this formula must adjust dynamically. 30 This need is reflected in various developing country proposals to address loss and damage. Highly vulnerable developing countries have increasingly called for approaches to help them deal with present and future loss and damage. They point out that the issue goes beyond issues of mitigation and adaptation (see box).    A BRIEF HISTORY OF LOSS AND DAMAGE UNDER THE UNFCCC 31 From the AOSIS proposal to the establishment of the Warsaw International Mechanism 1991. Vanuatu tables a proposal that asks for insurance of island states to compensate for sea-level rise. A further rationale for this proposal was the hope that assigning costs to climate impacts would increase mitigation ambition. 2007. The Bali Action plan agreed at COP13 mandates Parties to explore ""means to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable"", which was the first explicit reference to L&D. 2008. The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) tables a proposal for a multi-window mechanism for international loss and damage at the climate summit in Poznan (COP14), the first proposal for an international mechanism on loss and damage.  2010. The Cancun climate negotiations (COP16) establish a ""work programme in order to consider approaches to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries"", which through intense technical work resulted in a better understanding of the matter of loss and damage. 2012. The first distinct loss and damage decision agreed at COP18 in Doha defines the role of the Convention in addressing loss and damage and decides to establish institutional arrangements at COP19. 2013. COP19 establishes the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage. . At COP20 in Lima governments agree a two-year work plan for the Warsaw Mechanism (WIM), and a review of its arrangements in 2016; the WIM starts its work in September 2015.This marks the start of the work of the loss and damage mechanism.   FIRST STEPS UNDER THE WARSAW INTERNATIONAL MECHANISM ON LOSS AND DAMAGE At the 2013 UN climate conference in Warsaw (COP 19), the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM) was established to address some of the issues raised by developing countries. At the 2014 climate conference in Lima, its initial work plan was agreed, showing that addressing loss and damage requires a broad approach. Initial work will range from generating knowledge and understanding, to providing technical support for poor countries in using various financial instruments (see figure 3). After some delay, the first meeting of the WIM finally took place in September 2015. Its initial priority will be to implement the 2-year work plan, and this should also lay the basis for a 5-year rolling work plan (2017-2021) to be agreed at COP22 in 2016. A central element in the initial work plan of the WIM will be to draw on expertise and support from various organisations and stakeholders. For example, according to the work plan, the WIM will call on relevant organisations to generate knowledge on projected climate change-related displacement and migration. It will further engage with humanitarian and other organisations to develop country-specific analyses of climate change impacts and associated loss and damage. It will assess the capacity of humanitarian and disaster risk management systems, and engage in methodological work on scenario analysis and stress testing in the face of climate change. The WIM will also seek to enhance and promote comprehensive risk management approaches, including social protection instruments. Understanding the role of various national ministries and actors will be important for strengthening collaboration. All of this will be key to reducing loss and damage, and to developing and strengthening approaches for assessing and adequately responding, in accordance with projected climate risks. LOSS AND DAMAGE IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT Whether the Warsaw International Mechanism will be enough to meet the needs of vulnerable countries in managing the challenge of loss and damage will be judged over time. The WIM is not (yet) meant to be an instrument for delivering much-needed additional finance to poor countries and communities. However, it can lay the basis for a meaningful response from the international community. It is clear that the issue of loss and damage will be a substantial part of the climate reality of the 21st century. The international community must continuously address the associated problem by deepening their understanding, determining and implementing actions, and agreeing means of support. This would resemble the way that discussions continue on adaptation and mitigation, as awareness grows, and solutions are enacted.  Including loss and damage in the Paris Agreement is key to ensuring that the issue is addressed in the long-term and does not drop off the agenda. Inclusion in the Paris Agreement would also send a strong message of political commitment to the issue, and ensure a legal obligation to seek solutions for loss and damage. Developing countries have jointly made strong calls to include loss and damage in the Paris Agreement, separately from adaptation.33 Their most recent proposals have already backed away from some of the most politically contentious issues. These proposals do not focus solely on the historical responsibility of developed countries. As such, they constitute a moderate way of ensuring that work on loss and damage can evolve over time under the new agreement, and reflect immediate political needs such as approaches to help coordinate climate change displacement. In spite of these proactive efforts to compromise, their demands have not yet been met with similar constructive proposals on the side of developed countries. Some developed countries including the USA and Switzerland still argue that loss and damage should be only addressed through COP decisions on the WIM, rather than in the Paris Agreement. Others, such as the EU, have not yet positioned themselves clearly. But a Paris Agreement with no reference to loss and damage will be opposed by many developing countries, and would risk de-stabilizing the Paris negotiations. More importantly, ignoring loss and damage would also ignore today's climate reality for many poor countries and communities around the world.   4. CONCLUSIONS AND COP21 RECOMMENDATIONS   Loss and damage from climate change is now a reality. Addressing this effectively is a matter of climate justice and rights, and will require a range of tools that go beyond funding. At COP21 in Paris, the international community must send a strong signal that it is serious about loss and damage. This will require the following:  2. Furthermore, Parties should ensure that the WIM is  strengthened and: · Decide its work will continue beyond the planned 2016 review.  1. Reduce the incidence of loss and damage by: · Emissions reductions: enshrine the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and establish underpinning mechanisms such as a 2050 decarbonisation, emissions phase-out goal and 5 year successive commitment cycles; · Scaling-up adaptation: massively increase financial and other support to catalyse adaptation action at a scale needed to substantially reduce future losses and damages.  · Explore and establish financial instruments. (The first step must be to establish a financial panel with a mandate to make recommendations to ensure finance flows to support vulnerable communities facing the worst impacts). · Promote additional concrete actions to assist the poorest and most vulnerable in facing loss and damage (e.g. the development of redress schemes, adequate regional insurance approaches, building resilience of social safety nets, generation of finance from highly responsible companies, etc.)  2. The core Paris Agreement must: · Anchor loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in the Paris Agreement as a stand-alone issue in a separate article, including establishing a link to mitigation and adaptation efforts, which impact on the level of loss and damage; · Reflect the need for additional financial and technical support to be provided primarily by the countries most responsible for causing the problem, but taking into account evolving responsibilities over time; · Ensure that institutional arrangements under the Paris Agreement have a mandate to further strengthen work on addressing loss and damage as the problem evolves (building on, but not limited to, the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM)).  · Coordinate and develop legal and policy frameworks for particular types of loss and damage, for example climate displacement and migration. Exploring the role of a coordination facility, as well as addressing non-economic losses, could contribute towards this. · Provide for full and effective public participation in the work of the mechanism, particularly by the communities most affected by loss and damage and their representatives. Overall, governments must adopt a bold way forward on loss and damage in the Paris Agreement, to ensure that the issue has permanence and durability under the new framework.  "
CIDSE-1.txt,"Paris, for the  People and  the Planet  The Encyclical Laudato Si’ –  what it means for the COP21  negotiations and beyond  Executive summary  and key asks  This publication by CIDSE – an international alliance of 17 Catholic development agencies –  sets what we want to see from the Paris agreement as the first step to strong global action.  This is based on the evidence from our partners and poor communities of how a changing  climate is impacting on them. It is based on an ethical approach, inspired by Laudato Si’,  Pope Francis’ Encyclical Letter on Care for Our Common Home.1 This calls on governments  to consider the moral dimension of political decision, placing the poorest communities who  are suffering the most from climate change impacts at the centre of the debate. This report  outlines CIDSE’s vision for what the Encyclical means for the Paris agreement.  Governments agreed in Copenhagen in 2009 that “the increase in global temperature should  be below 2°C [compared to pre-industrial levels].”2 However, a recent expert report3 found  that, in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high risks are projected even for warming  above 1.5°C.4 This means the world needs to raise its ambition to tackle the climate crisis.  Richer countries – which have industrialised first and caused the current climate crisis  – should be the first to act, as they have the primary historical responsibility to prevent  dangerous climate change. They should assist poorer countries to adapt to its impacts and  pursue alternative, less polluting development models. Therefore, developed countries need  to implement deep cuts in domestic greenhouse gas emissions as a way to pay the “ecological  debt” owed to poorer countries, and ensure they deliver adequate, predictable and timely  climate finance to poor countries.  There are also a number of other issues which should form part of the Paris Agreement  discussions, such as the link with hunger and food security, the need to provide electricity to  billions who don’t have it, and the need to challenge the current economic model of growth  and the exclusive focus on market-based solutions.  The ecological crisis also reveals the systemic failures of a political and economic order driven  by vested interests and the exclusive focus on market-based solutions, which has failed to  put the common good at the heart of the economy. The current growth and development  paradigm is based on unequal economic, social and political systems, unequal distribution  and access to resources like water and land, leading to human rights violations, environmental  and social degradation and conflicts. Looking beyond the specific debate around the Paris  agreement, this needs to be challenged.  Finally, the ecological crisis is also a moral one. Inspired by Catholic Social Teaching, CIDSE  has always considered issues such as climate change from the viewpoint of entire humanity, to  provide a moral compass that motivates people everywhere to think about how their choices  are impacting on the poorest and most vulnerable.  4 Paris, for the People and the Planet  Therefore, CIDSE’s key asks to the international community for Paris and beyond are:  } Phase out all fossil fuel emissions and move towards a 100% renewable energy future with  sustainable energy access for all as early as possible (no later than 2050);  } Ensure that the 1.5°C threshold is enshrined in a legally binding global agreement;  } Set a goal for complete decarbonisation by 2050;  } Establish five-year reviews of pledges and ambition;  } Ensure a rights-based approach consistent with all relevant international conventions  (especially the right to food, land and water) to prevent any threat on human rights.  On climate finance:  } Developed countries should provide a plan and timeline on how they will ramp up  support to developing countries to meet the US$100 billion goal. They should include  increased public finance (particularly for adaptation needs up to 2020 and beyond) and  include five-year reviews of climate finance to prevent double-counting with existing ODA  commitments. There should be an improvement of the balance between the allocation of  finance to mitigation and adaptation and separate targets for each;  } Polluting fossil fuel projects should not be funded. Robust and transparent accounting  rules should be in place, to ensure climate investments “do-no-harm” and are socially  inclusive and gender sensitive.  On climate and agriculture:  } An explicit reference in the operative section of the core Paris agreement to the impact  of climate change on food security and the need to ensure climate action does not have  negative impacts on it;  } Mitigation of emissions in the land sector must not result in less ambition in other sectors;  } Support and promote agroecology (including through adequate public funding) and  sustainable and resilient food systems. Introduce a policy framework which supports small  food producers;  } Strengthen customary rights to land and natural resources to protect indigenous people;  } No endorsement of Climate Smart Agriculture as a solution for climate change.  On energy access:  } The commitment to phase-out of fossil fuels and shifting to 100% renewable energy  sources no later than 2050 should also include “sustainable energy access for all”, including  consistent policy and financing support by developed countries;  } Rapid implementation of the new Sustainable Development Goal N. 7 from 2016 onwards  to ensure access to affordable, reliable, safe and sustainable energy services for everyone.  On people and universal rights:  } Explicitly recognise that climate change impacts can jeopardise human rights;  } Establish a safeguard system to prevent social and environmental harm for all climate  actions, including a grievance mechanism and monitoring system for communities and  individuals negatively impacted. Language on human rights protection and fulfilment must  be legally binding;  } Ensure gender equality and full and effective and gender-responsive participation; food  security and the resilience of natural ecosystems, and a just transition that creates decent  work and quality jobs;  } Work towards enabling a radical change in people’s lifestyles towards living simply by  reducing overall energy consumption and making environmentally friendly choices.  Introduction  “The climate is a common good, belonging to all and meant for all. At the global level,  it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions for human life. A  very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing  warming of the climatic system [...] Humanity is called to recognise the need for changes  of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least  the human causes which produce or aggravate it.”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (23)  This publication by CIDSE – an international alliance of 17 Catholic development agencies  – sets out a vision for the UN conference in Paris,i and beyond, and is directly inspired by  Laudato Si’, Pope Francis’ Encyclical Letter on Care for Our Common Home. Six years after  the Copenhagen summit – widely seen as a failure – this marks another historic moment for  world’s leaders to seize the opportunity to agree on concrete, ambitious and fair solutions to  address these challenges. CIDSE actively follows the negotiations with the wider civil society  network and has identified key issues, crucial for Paris. These relate to: long-term goal, climate  finance, agriculture, human rights and energy transition.  The Papal Encyclical calls on governments to integrate all political decisions within a moral  and ethical dimension putting at the centre the poorest communities who are suffering the  most from climate change impacts. CIDSE is calling to move towards a just, equitable and  sustainable use and distribution of global resources by citizens of the world. Addressing the  global over-exploitation of finite natural resources requires limits to overall consumption.  Economic paradigms need reshaping in order to uphold human creativity, social inclusion,  gender equality and democratic political culture. New models of development would ensure  access to clean and safe energy, food, water, healthcare and education.  As Pope Francis says: we are one human family, sharing all of Creation, globally interdependent  and “faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather  with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental. Strategies for a solution  demand an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and  at the same time protecting nature.” (139)  We need to combine our calls towards policy makers with a change coming from individuals.  This call for a paradigm shift is reflected in the CIDSE campaign, Change for the Planet – Care  for the People, whose aim is to spark and enable a radical change in people’s lifestyles towards  living simply by reducing overall energy consumption and making environmentally friendly  food choices. People-led initiatives are blossoming world-wide and demonstrate that people  are willing to make the changes that politicians are still afraid to call for.ii  i From 30 November to 11 December 2015, the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will take place in Paris, France; this will be the  culmination of a one year round of negotiations in which countries were asked to reach a common agreement  on different aspects related to climate change.  ii CIDSE is also supporting the People’s Test on Climate, which sets collective expectations for Paris, being:  an urgent and drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; provide adequate support for transformation;  deliver justice for impacted people; focus on transformational action.  6 Paris, for the People and the Planet  Climate change and the mounting “ecological crisis,” together with poverty and inequality,  are central challenges of our times. There is a clear interconnection between social and  environmental justice. The ecological crisis reveals the systemic failures of a political and  economic order driven by vested interests and the exclusive focus on market-based solutions  and profit, which has failed to put the human being and the common good at the heart of  the economy. We need to put an end to the current growth and development paradigm of  unequal economic, social and political systems, unequal distribution and access to resources  like water and land, leading to human rights violations, environmental and social degradation  and conflicts.  Based on the vision of the Papal Encyclical, we hope the UN conference in Paris will help kick  start a process to:  } Bring transformative and systemic change to tackle the root causes of today’s social and  ecological crisis. This means moving away from fossil fuels and extractivist models of  development and transitioning into a world that ensures the planet and humanity’s survival  by keeping temperatures rise below 1.5°C. We need to move towards development models  that foster participation, equity, equality and justice for the most affected people;  } Spark and enable in others, as in ourselves, a radical change in lifestyles and values, an  ecological conversion that allows us to reduce overall energy consumption; privilege the  use of renewable energy resources and make environmentally conscious food choices that  minimise environmental impacts and allow producers to gain fair livelihoods;  } Support existing solutions that work: from small producers practicing agroecology to  guarantee food sovereignty, to communities developing decentralised management of  renewable sources of energy to ensure fair access to clean energy; and community-driven  projects that promote a culture of care and global solidarity;  } Agree on a fair, ambitious, binding and transformative agreement, one that thoroughly  addresses the ecological debt owed to present and future generations; one that enhances the  decarbonisation of our societies to secure a safe, fair and clean future; one that addresses  how societies will mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and one that places  the respect of human rights above particular interests. We need strong commitments that will  ensure social and environmental justice for all, putting people and planet first.  We cannot overlook the deep historical inequalities, but must confront the lack of equity  between North and South. The onus cannot only be on those who have never had.  There is no time to wait anymore. It’s not about “more”, it’s about better, just and fairer for all.  It’s about justice!  1. Shared vision and  the temperature goal  “The myopia of power politics delays the inclusion of a far-sighted environmental  agenda within the overall agenda of governments. Thus we forget that ‘time is greater  than space’, that we are always more effective when we generate processes rather than  holding on to positions of power. True statecraft is manifest when, in difficult times, we  uphold high principles and think of the long-term common good.”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (178)  A changing climate is already impacting lives,  livelihoods, health, ecosystems, economies,  food security, amplifying existing risks  and creating new ones. The poorest and  most vulnerable communities are being  hit hardest, as they have limited capacity  to adapt. Climate change risks pushing  people and communities back into poverty,  undoing decades of development gains.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC): “People who are  socially, economically, culturally, politically,  institutionally, or otherwise marginalised are  especially vulnerable to climate change.”The Copenhagen Accord says that “the  increase in global temperature should be  below 2°C [compared to pre-industrial  levels]”6 and this is now the temperature  threshold for the international United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC) negotiations. However,  a recent expert report found that, in some  regions and vulnerable ecosystems, high  risks are projected for warming above  1.5°C.7 Limiting global warming to 2°C is not  sufficient to protect the poorest and most  vulnerable people. Anything above 1.5°C  could result in extreme losses that countries  and communities are unable to adapt to. For  the Least Developed Countries (LDCs)8 and  the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS)where impacts are already felt most severely,  a 1.5°C target is a matter of survival.10 Over  100 countries worldwide are calling for it to  be included in the Paris agreement for the  sake of present and future generations.  The 2°C target is essentially a “political” targetthat would allow for social and economic  inequalities that exist independently of  the climate crisis to get worse. For CIDSE  the target also needs to act as a catalyst  for transformative change moving beyond  “business as usual”, towards a just, equitable  and sustainable use and distribution of global  resources by citizens of the world. This is also  a clear message from the Papal Encyclical “we  have to realise that a true ecological approach  always becomes a social approach; it must  integrate questions of justice in debates on the  environment, so as to hear both the cry of the  earth and the cry of the poor.”12 (49)  This means those who are historically most  responsible and have a higher capacity to  act than others due to their high income and  wealth, level of development and access to  technologies should shoulder majority of  the burden. Failure to stay within a 1.5°C  limit would also require greater commitment  in terms of finance, technological and  knowledge support from developed countries  to assist those countries most at risk to climate  change. The Potsdam Institute for Climate  Impact Research (PIK) found that “actions  for returning global warming to below 1.5°C  by 2100 are in many ways similar to those  limiting warming to below 2°C” but that “the  more ambitious 1.5°C goal leaves no space  to further delay global mitigation action and  emission reductions need to scale up swiftly  in the next decades.”The IPCC concluded that to have at least a  50% chance of staying below 1.5°C, cuts in  global CO2 emissions in the order of 70-95%  below 2010 levels by 2050 are needed.14 This  requires eliminating fossil fuels as soon as  possible, and no later than 2050.  8 Paris, for the People and the Planet  According to Pope Francis: “We know  that technology based on the use of highly  polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also  oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be  progressively replaced without delay.”Yet fossil fuel extraction and production  currently still receive trillions of dollars in  subsidies from governments every year.  According to the International Monetary  Fund’s (IMF) latest findings16, these subsidies  amount to US$1,000 a year for every citizen  living in the G20 group of the world’s leading  economies, despite the G20’s pledge in 2009to phase out support for coal, oil and gas.  CIDSE is calling for:  } Phasing out all fossil fuel emissions and  moving towards a 100% renewable energy  future with sustainable energy access for all  as early as possible (no later than 2050);  } Ensuring that the 1.5°C threshold is enshrined  in a legally binding global agreement,  with ambitious mitigation commitments  and actions from all countries, depending  on their common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities  (CBDRRC);  } Complete decarbonisation by 2050;  } Five-year reviews of pledges and ambition  to confirm emission pathways are in line  with the principle of equity, the latest  science and the long term temperature  and decarbonisation goal. The periodic  review should also identify gaps and ensure  additional action, where country pledges  do not fulfil the principle of common  and individual responsibilities under the  Paris Climate agreement and the UNFCCC.  Countries must equally be held to account  where their commitments are inconsistent  with their national action plans.  Deep cuts in domestic greenhouse gas  emissions in developed countries are  needed to pay the “ecological debt” owed to  poorer countries, as part of a just approach  to tackling the global climate crisis based  on intergenerational equity. This includes  the delivery of adequate, predictable and  timely international climate finance to help  developing countries. This requires that  developed countries meet their commitment  to provide US$100 billion dollars per year by  2020, agreed in Copenhagen in 2009. This is  the foundation of a just climate settlement  and will build the trust necessary to secure  a strong outcome in Paris that facilitates  ambitious climate action on the ground.  We consider this a form of reparation for the  damage caused historically by industrialised  countries, mainly through the burning of fossil  fuels, which still receive trillions of dollars  of subsidies from governments each year. A  “finance package” should cover both the pre-  2020 and the post-2020 periods. In Laudato  Si’ the Pope writes “developed countries ought  to help pay this debt by significantly limiting  their consumption of non-renewable energy  and by assisting poorer countries to support  policies and programmes of sustainable  development…...We must continue to be  aware that, regarding climate change, there  are differentiated responsibilities.” (52)  2. Ecological debt and  climate finance  “A true “ecological debt” exists, particularly between the global north and south,  connected to commercial imbalances with effects on the environment, and the  disproportionate use of natural resources by certain countries over long periods of  time.”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (51)  Delivery of climate finance needs to adhere  to the “do no harm” principle (see below) and  not provide support for polluting fossil fuel  projects or false solutions such as “climate  smart agriculture”18 (see section 3). Climate  finance should ensure that investments do  not make the poorest and most vulnerable  worse off and aim to maximise social and  environmental co-benefits.19 This could  involve investing in access to sustainable  energy services for the poorest, forest  protection and building institutional and  human capacity in developing countries  to ensure that climate change planning is  socially inclusive and pro-poor.  Local communities on the frontlines of  climate change must participate in decision-making  over the financing of adaptation and  mitigation initiatives in the global South.  Transparent monitoring and reporting of  climate finance flows will ensure public  accountability. It will also uphold the Cancun  agreement that “Parties should, in all climate  change-related actions, fully respect human  rights.” Since climate change impacts, as well  as adaptation and mitigation projects aimed  at addressing them, can have differentiated  impacts on men and women (as underlined  by the IPCC 5th Assessment), climate finance  provision must be gender-sensitive.  Climate finance should support countries’  right to development by funding low-carbon  and climate-resilient development strategies  which are in line with recipient countries’ and  its citizens development priorities in order to  maximise effectiveness.  Finally, current levels of public finance are  far below what is needed20, and adaptation in  particular remains under-funded.21 Developed  countries may deploy a range of instruments,channels and actors to meet the US$100  billion goal. Funding from public budgets will  have to increase significantly and any private  sector finance must be complementary to  rather than a substitute for public sector  finance, especially for funding adaptation.  Predictable public finance for adaptation is  essential for developing countries to deal with  the unavoidable impacts of climate change.  All climate finance, whether public or private,  should be held to the same accounting  and transparency rules and have strong  environmental and human rights standards  and safeguards, accountability mechanisms  and evaluation of results.  CIDSE is calling for:  } Developed countries to provide a plan  and timeline on how they intend to ramp  up support to developing countries in line  with meeting the US$100 billion goal. This  should include qualitative and quantitative  information on actors, channels, sources  and instruments to deliver predictable and  scaled-up funds between now and 2020,  demonstrating how the balance between  adaptation and mitigation finance will  address the adaptation gap;  } Developed countries pledges to include  increased public finance, particularly for  adaptation needs, up to 2020 and beyond;  } Not limiting the focus of countries’ climate  finance pledges to creating ‘enabling  environments’ in developing countries to  attract new investments and leveraging  private sector finance;  } Including five-year reviews of climate  finance to prevent double-counting with  existing Official Development Assistance  (ODA) commitments. Separate targets  should be set for adaptation and for  mitigation finance, informed by the needs  of recipient countries;  } Including (through a COP decision) a  commitment to improve the balance  between the allocation of climate finance to  mitigation and adaptation, aiming to reach  50:50 by 2020. The Paris climate agreement  must include a 50% public climate finance  floor for adaptation so that all countries  make the same commitment;  } Closing the loophole for climate finance  to fund polluting fossil fuel projects.  Institutions at national, regional and global  level – Multilateral Development Banks,  national development agencies, export  credit agencies and the new Green Climate  Fund – should shift all forms of support  away from fossil fuels to renewable energy  and energy efficiency that can support low  carbon development;  10 Paris, for the People and the Planet  } Ensuring robust and transparent accounting  for climate finance: common reporting  frameworks for emission reduction  commitments, development assistance  and climate finance are needed to ensure  commitments can be compared, and to  track progress. Only finance with climate  action as a principal objective should be  counted as climate finance  } Ensuring climate investments “do-no-harm”  and are socially inclusive and gender  sensitive by mandating public participation in  decision-making over projects funded, as well  as monitoring and evaluation frameworks.  Investment criteria should ensure finance  does not damage local eco-systems, local  communities, violate human rights or lead  to negative impacts such as the further  impoverishment of vulnerable and poor  groups. All climate finance should be gender-sensitive  and promote gender equality.  iii Corresponding to the OECD DAC Rio Marker 2.  3. Climate and  agriculture nexus  “ [...] there is a great variety of small-scale food production systems which feed the greater  part of the world’s peoples, using a modest amount of land and producing less waste, be  it in small agricultural parcels, in orchards and gardens, hunting and wild harvesting  or local fishing. Economies of scale, especially in the agricultural sector, end up forcing  smallholders to sell their land or to abandon their traditional crops […]”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (129)  Climate change, agriculture and food security  are inextricably linked, and addressing  existing global hunger while preparing to  feed an increasing population in the context  of a changing climate is a defining challenge  of our times. Agriculture is a key sector, both  in terms of the emissions the sector itself  generates and the detrimental impacts on  rural communities as a result of increased  weather variability and loss of resources.  Therefore the Paris agreement must facilitate  an enabling policy framework that supports  rather than undermine “agroecological”  approaches, ensuring secure access to natural  resources and avoiding ‘false solutions’.  Agricultural activities, including the  indirect consequences of land use change,  deforestation and transport, account for  one third of total greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions.23 The contribution of agricultural  production to GHG emissions is significant  but a distinction between industrial and small-scale  food production needs to be made.  Whilst food production is widely blamed  for generating the lion’s share (80-86%)24 of  GHG emissions related to the food system,  emissions which result from activities beyond  the farm gate account for approximately half  of food chain emissions.25 In addition, middle-income  countries will likely follow this trend  in the future26 primarily due to an increase in  industrialisation and standardisation of food  systems.  At the same time the agricultural sector is  particularly affected by climate change and  measures to help vulnerable communities to  adapt will be needed in order to face climate-related  challenges such as desertification,  land degradation, drought, floods and  water scarcity. A range of adverse effects  of climate change, most notably on small  scale farming have raised income inequality,  reduced household wealth, undermined  food security and have affected women  disproportionately.27 In developing countries,  these risks are greatly exacerbated by low  levels of investment in small scale farmers,  low access to technology, reliance on rain-fed  agriculture, and high levels of pre-existing  food insecurity and poverty. It is estimated  that by 2080, 600 million people will suffer  from hunger and malnutrition due to climate  change.Nevertheless, smallholder farmers can be very  efficient in terms of production per hectare  and have a huge potential for ensuring food  security and realising the right to food while  improving the resilience of food systems. They  manage over 80% of the world’s estimated  500 million small farms and provide over 80%  of the food consumed in a large part of the  developing world, contributing significantly to  poverty reduction and food security.29 Thus it  is important that the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities should be respected: the burden  of mitigating emissions should not be solely  placed on developing countries or on the  shoulders of small-scale food producers. The  new climate agreement must protect the right  to food and promote more sustainable ways  of producing, distributing, transforming and  consuming food.  To be able to keep global temperature rise  below 1.5°C, we urgently need to begin a  transition toward a sustainable, low-carbon  society. This will require radical changes in our  methods of production and our consumption  habits, particularly in the agriculture sector.  CIDSE promotes agroecology – which  enhances agricultural systems by using and  recycling natural resources and shifting  away from the use of fossil fuels – as the  only holistic approach to agriculture, based  on practices and principles that are truly  productive in the face of climate change.  Agroecological practices also greatly improve  organic matter (carbon) in the soil and largely  eliminate the need for long distant transport,  freezing and processing and serve to prevent  deforestation.v  However, other multi-stakeholders initiatives  such as the Global Alliance for Climate  Smart Agriculture31 are gaining ground. Far  from being a new, ‘revolutionary’ concept  addressing both agriculture and climate change  issues, climate smart agriculture appears to  be another form of “green-washing”. The  Alliance, dominated by private interests, lacks  in monitoring and accountability tools, in  social and environmental safeguards and in  the representation of developing countries.In order to truly tackle the structural causes  of climate change, a clear choice needs to be  made between different sets of technologies,  models and practices33 in order to avoid  promoting false solutions dangerous for  people and the planet.  CIDSE is calling for:  } Making explicit reference to the impact  of climate change on food security in  the operative section of the core Paris  agreement  } Ensuring that climate action does not have  negative impacts on food security  } Mitigation of emissions in the land sector  must not result in less ambition in other  sectors to avoid compensation or a zero net  emissions goal approach;  } Designing the new climate agreement  in a way that supports and promotes  agroecology and sustainable and resilient  food systems while ensuring that vulnerable  people have access to natural resources and  are empowered in their ability to adapt to  climate change;  iv Also known as CBDRRC.  v Soil carbon sequestration can be brought about by good agricultural management (e.g. restoring soils  and tackling fossil fuel dependency through agroecological methods). However, sequestration should  be considered an additional benefit, and land use activities should not be considered a primary goal of  adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies. Nor should it be considered as a way to further develop  carbon market mechanisms just like it has been done in the forest sector.  vi Paragraph 15 under section C.  vii CIDSE joins the call by several civil society groups to include in the Paris text the following language:  “Parties shall, when pursuing actions in the land sector in addition to actions in other sectors and consistent  with all relevant international obligations, prioritise the protection, maintenance and restoration of natural  ecosystems; undertake emissions reductions and removals in an equitable manner; and the governing body  shall develop principles and guidelines for ensuring social protections, food security, ecological integrity,  transparency and comparability in relation to such actions”.  12 Paris, for the People and the Planet  } Not endorsing Climate Smart Agriculture  as a solution for climate change. The “Lima  Paris Action Agenda of Solutions”viii for  COP21, aiming to highlight non-State action  to reach an ambitious agreement in 2015,  should not include projects labelled Climate  Smart Agriculture;  } Allocating adequate funds for truly  sustainable agricultural programmes  in developing countries through public  investments, including the US$ 100 billion  commitment to the Green Climate Fund (GCF);  } Introducing a policy framework which  supports – instead of weakens – the practices  of small food producers such as open-pollinated  seed varieties, crop diversity and  low-input agricultural practices”;ix  } Strengthening customary rights to land and  natural resources to protect indigenous  people, and applying Free Prior and Informed  Consent (FPIC) principles to them.x    4. Energy transition and  ending poverty  “There is an urgent need to develop policies so that, in the next few years, the emission of  carbon dioxide and other highly polluting gases can be drastically reduced, for example,  substituting for fossil fuels and developing sources of renewable energy. Worldwide there  is minimal access to clean and renewable energy.”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (26)  Our current energy system is not meeting the  needs of billions of people around the world  who lack access to modern energy services:  1.1 billion have no access to electricity while  2.8 billion cook with polluting fuels.34 95% of  the energy poor people live in developing Asia  and Sub-Saharan Africa, mostly in rural areas  that are not connected to the grid. The most  cost-effective and reliable way of providing  them with access is often decentralised  (off-grid, largely renewable) energy. This is  particularly true of electricity. In sub-Saharan  Africa, in particular, grid electrification is not  keeping up with population growth.  Globally, there has also been very little  progress on clean cooking access. Investing  in clean and efficient cooking solutions is also  critical to prevent the negative health impacts  of indoor air pollution from using traditional  fuels − particularly on women and girls.  Investing in sustainable energy and energy  efficiency globally is crucial to protect the  climate and also the poorest who are most  vulnerable to climate change impacts. With  sufficient and appropriate support, poorer  countries could ‘leapfrog’ to a cleaner,  more affordable and more inclusive energy  pathways for development.  Pope Francis’ Encyclical Laudato Si’ calls for  an urgent transition away from polluting fossil  fuels to renewable energy. This should be  available to everyone, including the poorest.  Richer countries should take responsibility  by supporting poorer countries to make the  energy shift through financing, technology  transfer and technical assistance. Maximising  energy efficiency is a key building block of  the energy shift, it adds.  CIDSE is calling for:  } The commitment to phase-out of fossil fuels  and shifting to 100% renewables no later  than 2050 should also include “sustainable  energy access for all”, including through  consistent policy and financing support by  developed countries;  } Rapid implementation of the new Sustainable  Development Goal N. 7 from 2016 onwards  to ensure access to affordable, reliable,  safe and sustainable energy services for  everyone and action to decarbonise energy  systems sufficiently by 2030 to keep the  world below 1.5°C of warming.xi  xi This requires indicators that are fit for purpose i.e. “measure what matters”, and sufficient and appropriate  support for implementation, including financing, technical assistance, appropriate technology transfer and  capacity building.  5. Equity and human rights  “We have to realise that a true ecological approach always becomes a social approach; it  must integrate questions of justice in debates on the environment, so as to hear both the  cry of the earth and the cry of the poor”  Pope Francis, Laudato Si’, On Care for Our Common Home (49)  Climate change and the mounting ‘ecological  crisis’, together with poverty and inequality,  are the central challenges of our times. But,  as Pope Francis says, these are not separate  problems: they represent one complex crisis,  both social and environmental. This requires  “an integrated approach to combating  poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and  at the same time protecting nature”. (139)  Climate change has the biggest impact on  poor communities in poor countries, which  see their lives disrupted by mega-storms,  droughts or flooding. When these catastrophes  happen in poor regions of the world, it puts  them in an even more difficult situation, as  there are currently no concrete adaptation  plans. For example, almost one billion people  do not have access to sufficient food to live  well and climate change is expected to further  threaten food production and food security.  As a result of this instability, numerous human  rights are threatened; the right to food, life,  health and development. Climate change also  threatens to reverse progress made in recent  years on healthcare, education, transport and  decent employment. The poorest people,  particularly women, children, and disabled  people in rural areas are the most affected  by climate change − they are also the groups  who have contributed least to causing the  problem. Despite this – and despite the huge  resources poured into global discussions  about climate change − the world’s poorest  people have no say or representation in  public decision-making.  The ecological crisis reveals the systemic  failures of a political and economic order  driven by vested interests and the exclusive  focus on market-based solutions, which has  failed to put the common good at the heart  of the economy. We need to challenge the  current growth and development paradigm.  This is based on unequal economic, social  and political systems, unequal distribution  and access to resources like water and  land, leading to human rights violations,  environmental and social degradation and  conflicts.  14 Paris, for the People and the Planet  At its root then, the ecological crisis is not  just an economic and an environmental issue  but a moral one. Inspired by Catholic Social  Teaching, CIDSE has always considered issues  such as climate change from the viewpoint of  entire humanity, to provide a moral compass  that motivates people everywhere to do the  right thing and think about how their choices  are impacting on the poorest and most  vulnerable.  For CIDSE, this is about people, and our  capacity as humanity to secure safe and  dignified lives for all. It is a demand that  comes from communities and people at the  frontlines. Keeping temperatures down below  the 1.5°C threshold also means ensuring  communities are given adequate support as  indigenous and other unique human systems  will face increasingly higher risks of losing  their land, their cultural and natural heritage,  community cohesion, sense of place, and  identity.  Pope Francis’ concept of “ecological debt”,  mentioned in section 2, means that these deep  historical inequalities cannot be overlooked  within the climate negotiations. The lack  of equity between the North and the South  must be addressed. “Inequity affects not only  individuals but entire countries; it compels  us to consider an ethics of international  relations.” (51)  Equity for CIDSE is not only about how to  share the effort35 (emissions reductions and  support) amongst countries in a fair way. It is  also about building a transformative agenda  for social justice and human rights. On this  collective journey we need to understand how  to challenge the ever rising inequality and  to insist on a pro-people agenda of decent  wages, universal services, social protection,  and on narrowing the gap between rich and  poor. And most of all ensure we leave a safer,  fairer and cleaner world to future generations.  “Intergenerational solidarity is not optional,  but rather a basic question of justice, since  the world we have received also belongs to  those who will follow us.” (159)  The UN Human Rights Council and the Office  of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  have repeatedly and emphatically highlighted  the adverse effects of climate change on  human rights. Echoing the Council resolution,  Parties to the UNFCCC emphasised the  importance of respecting human rights in all  climate related actions as part of the Cancun  Agreement in 2010, stating that “Parties  should, in all climate change-related actions,  fully respect human rights.”xii  Experience with climate finance projects –  especially the Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) – has shown a policy gap in protecting  human rights in climate policy. While  mostly well intentioned, some projects have  harmed the environment and people – even  infringing on rights to life, health, food, water  and sanitation, housing, and culture, among  others.36 A closer look at the instruments  established under the UNFCCC to address  climate change reveals that so far, the Cancun  mandate has been weakly operationalised  and enforced.xiii  In Laudato Si’, Pope Francis points to the  interconnected social and environmental  crises affecting our ‘common home’ and the  intimate relationship between the poor and  the fragility of the planet.  xii 1/CP.16, paragraph 8: The Human Rights Council stated in 2009 that “climate change-related impacts have a  range of implications, both direct and indirect, for the effective enjoyment of human rights.”  xiii The recognition of existing human rights obligations is critical if safeguards and accountability measures are  to be established for all climate actions, democratisation of the decision-making process as well as full and  effective participation in design and implementation of measures to address climate change.  CIDSE is calling for:  } Specifying how existing human rights  obligations apply in the context of climate  change and explicitly recognising that  climate change impacts can jeopardise  human rights;  } Language on human rights protection and  fulfilment must be legally binding; xiv  } Establishing a safeguard system to prevent  social and environmental harm, applicable  to all climate actions. This would include  a grievance mechanism and monitoring  system for communities and individuals  negatively impacted by climate actions;  } In all climate change related actions human  rights should be respected, protected,  promoted and fulfilled for all, including the  most marginalised and vulnerable. Gender  equality and full and effective and gender-responsive  participation should be ensured;  food security and the resilience of natural  ecosystems should be protected; the need  for a just transition that creates decent work  and quality jobs should be included;  } The 1.5°C threshold is vital and adequate  climate action will remain unachievable  without taking principles of equity  (intragenerational and intergenerational),  common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities (CBDRRC),  historical responsibilities, and the right to  sustainable development fully into account.  xiv and most appropriately fits in the operative section of the core of the agreement. We join the call by  several civil society groups to include the following language: “All Parties shall, in all climate change related  actions, respect, protect, promote, and fulfil human rights for all, including the rights of indigenous peoples;  be guided by gender equality and ensure full and effective and gender-responsive participation; promote  food security and the protection and resilience of natural ecosystems; and consider a just transition of the  workforce that creates decent work and quality jobs.”  6. Change for the Planet –  Care for the People  Reflecting on the work CIDSE carries out  with its member organisations towards  social justice, the campaign Change for the  Planet – Care for the People aims to promote  sustainable ways of living. The global overexploitation  of natural resources puts people  and planet at risk and it starts with vulnerable  people living in poverty.  Inspired by Pope Francis’ Encyclical Letter  Laudato Si’, which states: “Every effort  to protect and improve our world entails  profound changes in lifestyles, models of  production and consumption, and the  established structures of power which today  govern societies” (5), we are convinced that  “a change in lifestyle could bring healthy  pressure to bear on those who wield political,  economic and social power.” (206)  The campaign calls for a radical change in  people’s lifestyles towards living simply by  reducing overall energy consumption and  making environmentally friendly food choices.  This can be done by limiting consumption to  sustainably-produced local foods that minimise  environmental impact, allow producers to gain  fair livelihoods, do not violate human rights,  and are also affordable.  On food consumption and production, the  campaign encourages people to become  “food citizens,” engaging in behaviours that  support the development of a democratic,  socially and economically just and  environmentally sustainable food system. The  campaign encourages people to re-gain food  preparation preservation and conservation  skills, as well as gaining knowledge on food  production (e.g. knowing your farmer, being  aware of seasonality).  16 Paris, for the People and the Planet  The lifestyle challenges include:  } Participating in food production to the  extent that you can (e.g. if you have a  space, grow your own food / make a little  compost). Only by growing some food for  yourself can you become acquainted with  the beautiful energy cycle that revolves  from soil to seed to flower to fruit to food  to offal to decay, and around again;  } Preparing your own meals. This should also  enable you to eat more cheaply and it will  give you a measure of “quality control”: you  will have some reliable knowledge of what  has been added to the food you eat;  } Buying local food. The locally produced  seasonal food supply is the most secure and  fresh option and it uses the least energy in  production, while being easiest for local  consumers to understand and influence.  On energy consumption and production,  the campaign encourages individuals to  become aware of their energy consumption  and supply. We encourage individuals to reconsider  the amount of energy really needed,  to prioritise community actions aiming to  share energy costs and to invest in renewable  sources for energy production.  The lifestyle challenges include:  } Cut down the amount of energy you use.  Avoid leaving appliances on stand-by, install  energy-saving bulbs, choose appliances  with the highest rating (AAA) on the energy  label and insulate your home or install  double-glazing;  } Phase out fossil fuel use. In order to limit  global warming and its dangerous social  impacts, we should limit natural gas, oil and  coal usage and favour renewable energy  sources such as wind or solar power.  Our commitment – together with several  successful models of sustainable living that  already exist – demonstrates that society is  ready and asking for far-reaching change in  policy and practice. In this way, Change for  the Planet – Care for the People wants to join  the thousands of people that will mobilise  around the COP21 in Paris and all around the  world calling for system change in order to  prevent further climate change. A difference  can be made if acting together.  Conclusion  At many times in history, the international community has proven it can overcome divisions in  a common effort to respond to significant threats and pursue a world of peace, environmental,  climate, economic and social justice, and gender equality. Now is one of those moments.xv  For example, over the past four years we have seen unprecedented levels of discussion,  consultation and mobilisation in the preparation of the new global Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs). These rightly propose a universal agenda, aiming to tackle both poverty and  climate change.  Yet there are gaps and inconsistencies linking these discussions within the Paris agreement:  for example continued competition for limited natural resources which can lead to further  rises in greenhouse gas emissions without tackling inequality and poverty is contradictory.  The current SDG agreement does not cover issues such as the unjust global rules of finance,  taxation, trade and investment, all essential to realise the structural transformation needed to  address the root causes of poverty and inequality. The Paris Agreement also risks suffering  from a number of shortcomings and contradictions on climate finance, human rights, and the  right to food.  As the world moves forward with the implementation of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement,  the major contradictions inherent in these processes will have to be tackled. CIDSE’s proposals  − based on Pope Francis’ ground-breaking Encyclical Letter − can hopefully provide useful a  roadmap on how to bring systemic and transformational change within the Paris Agreement  negotiations and beyond.  18 Paris, for the People and the Planet"
ClimateInstitute-1.txt,"Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  Rick Barnett  June 2016  1The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  The Challenge  The climate agreement signed at COP21 in December 2015 set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets, while the proposed Clean Power Plan requires electric utilities to play a key role in executing these goals. At present, the legal and political opposition to the Plan has made the results very difficult to predict, while the Paris accords remain hugely controversial in Washington and on the campaign circuit. Furthermore, market-based emission reduction strategies such as a carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme appear unlikely to gain political momentum. While public sector solutions to climate change deserve serious effort, these programs, proposals, and agreements are by no means guaranteed to be successful. Thus, national and international governance needs to also consider business solutions for creating a low-carbon future.  Buildings consume about 40% of the energy generated in the United States.1 For homes, about 43% of the primary energy consumption and 54% of site energy consumption is for interior space heating and cooling.2 This proposal offers a new option for reducing unnecessary consumption for maintaining interior space at a comfortable temperature.  Existing U.S. efficiency programs have done little to curb space conditioning energy or to improve the thermal performance of our country’s 130 million homes, 44% of which were built before 1970.3  “Major Opportunities to Reach Higher Electricity Savings by 2030”, a recent American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy publication, states that “finding ways of increasing participation in whole-building retrofits is key to driving increased savings in this sector”. While this acknowledges the high volume of energy used for space conditioning, the report goes on to predict that whole building retrofits will capture only 1% of near-term energy efficiency investments.4 This projection indicates that space conditioning will remain the largest piece of homeowner energy expense.  U.S efficiency programs are credited for installing conventional efficiency products such as windows, lighting, fiberglass insulation, appliances and thermostats. Because a home only has one meter, reduced consumption from efficiency products is estimated, and can’t be verified with actual measurement. It’s unlikely that these estimates account for all the variables in real life.  2The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  Current efficiency programs address space conditioning with weatherization, which only improves accessible portions of the thermal shell. Weatherization leaves an unconditioned attic just inches above the living space, and does little to prevent heat loss through walls, the largest percentage of a home’s thermal shell. A key feature of this proposal is the use of new construction thermal systems to upgrade existing residential buildings.  Thermal Optimization  A home’s thermal performance can be optimized by thoroughly installing an effective and continuous thermal seal. This reduces a home’s propensity to use space conditioning energy. The improved thermal performance can be measured with established scoring systems, such as the “Home Energy Score” from USDOE.5 Thermal shell improvement is the only efficiency upgrade that allows post-construction measurement. From this measurement, reduced consumption and emissions can be determined and monetized over the life of the home. Greater resilience is a separate benefit of improved thermal performance.  Optimization can be produced with existing technology and labor, and commercially-available materials. Siding, spray insulation and rigid insulation contractors already have the skills to achieve this level of performance. If a program is implemented on a neighborhood scale, cost would quickly be driven down, similar to the cost difference between a custom and a production home. No conventional efficiency measure can match the dramatic footprint reduction resulting from optimizing a home’s thermal performance.  3The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  The Optimized Home    For the sample home, reduced kWh was evaluated with the Energy Trust of Oregon’s “Energy Performance Score” (EPS). As with most scoring systems, EPS has an energy score to convey a home’s kWh space conditioning energy requirement. The system also has a carbon score which converts kWh into pounds of carbon emissions.  Using EPS, I estimated that the average existing U.S. house has an energy score of 90, consuming 9000 kWh annually for space conditioning. After an optimization retrofit, the score would drop to 45 (4500 kWh annually). The sample home’s energy score is decreased by 50%, eliminating 4500 kWh in space conditioning energy annually.  The pre-retrofit energy score of 90 converts to 16,000 pounds of carbon, while the post-retrofit score of 45 represents only 6,000 pounds of carbon. The value of this measured demand reduction will invariably increase over the life of the home.  High performance products, such as rigid insulation from Dow and spray insulation from BASF, are just starting to move into the energy retrofit market. Deep energy retrofits are encouraged through projects like Affordable Comfort Inc. (ACI)’s “1000 Home Challenge”, but homeowners do not allocate many of their retrofit dollars to the thermal shell. Even with incentives, only 28 homes have met ACI’s high performance standards.6 Invisible efficiency cannot compete in a homeowner’s budget with flashy appliances, floors and countertops.  4The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  Utility Financing  Responding to historically low homeowner investment in thermal efficiency, this proposal shifts the retrofit investment to the home’s energy supplier. A utility’s interest to supply the home’s energy is much longer in duration than the typical owner’s duration of ownership. With a 15-20 year loan, a utility could generate a reasonable return, produce significant demand reduction, and secure the home as an energy customer through on-bill financing.  Given that most houses are similarly constructed, the cost estimate assumes the use of established, repetitive procedures for every optimized home.  AVERAGE PER HOUSE COST ESTIMATE: $11,000  RETROFIT COST RANGE: $8,000 to $16,000 per house, with variables such as physical access to the thermal shell, sq. ft. of walls, and sq. ft. of roof.  The Rocky Mountain Institute estimates a $150 billion residential energy upgrades market opportunity.7 Utilities are capital intensive and accustomed to long-term investments. Faced with growing complexity and emission constraints, utilities can now look to thermal optimization as a viable demand-side investment.  A popular tool for energy efficiency projects is Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing which allows local governments to administer efficiency loans using private capital dispensed through the jurisdiction’s property tax system. Homeowner loans support clean energy projects, including efficiency. Residential PACE has been limited due to the complexity of being secured by a home’s mortgage. Utility financing eliminates the mortgage connection, as the investment is secured by the home’s need for electricity.  5The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  Utilities nation-wide offer their customers on-bill financed efficiency. For example, The United Illuminating Company (a Connecticut private utility) has an energy retrofit program which does not include transactions between homeowners and public agencies. It simply connects building contractors to the utility’s energy customers and uses in-house, on-bill financing. With their ability to tie efficiency loans to the meter, rather than to the house or owner, utilities have the key to unlocking the energy asset in our homes.  Converging Trends  Several trends combine to create conditions that would allow utilities to deliver high performance energy retrofits for both metropolitan and small town homeowners:   Utilities are responding to emission constraints and state utility commissions with growing demand-side investment;   Existing efficiency programs are not taking steps to reduce space conditioning energy, the largest portion of residential demand;   Several home performance scoring systems have been developed;   The insulation industry has created high performance thermal systems.   Utilities are pursuing new opportunities to retain and better serve customers;   RESNET has connected performance scoring to the energy code, and introduced real estate and appraisal professionals to the value of high performance;   Utilities are facing disruptive challenges, including peak overload, power plant closure, constrained load pockets, customer retention and the popularity of renewables.   Utility per-home investment in emission-reducing upgrades has jumped to a new level, with pilot projects in Arizona that install PV on customer homes, and a pilot in New York that will go further, with PV + storage in the customer upgrade.  6The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  These trends improve the feasibility of a utility-scale program to optimize the thermal performance of residential customer homes. Occupants of an optimized home would enjoy greater comfort without new expense, and use the least amount of space conditioning energy.  The value of predictable demand reduction would allow utilities to offer optimized retrofits at no new cost to the current or future homeowner. And after on-bill accounting for the retrofit cost, the homeowner’s energy bill would drop.  A utility-scale Thermal Optimization Program would change several elements commonly found in US energy efficiency programs:   shift energy retrofit investment from homeowner to home’s energy supplier;   elevate energy performance standard;   target the largest piece of residential energy demand, rather than smaller pieces;   measure demand reduction, rather than using a calculation;   improve technology from weatherization, which upgrades accessible portions of the thermal shell, to optimization, which thoroughly seals the entire thermal shell;   require no tax dollars or government agencies  With a focus on the largest part of residential energy use, the private sector could take a big step toward a low-carbon future. As a private sector program, the utility, construction, and insulation industries could collaborate to reduce the residential footprint.  As an expanded utility service to residential customers, thermal optimization would give local economies a much-needed jolt. The task may seem large, but the value of greater resilience and fewer emissions would increase over the life of an optimized home and provide immense returns on the initial investment. The future utility will invariably have to optimize the use of electricity for every customer.  7The Climate Institute|Thermal Optimization: A Private Sector Program for Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings  Rick Barnett produced this proposal as a guest writer for the Climate Institute.

ClimateInstitute-2.txt,"  Climate Analytics  Supporting science based policy to prevent dangerous  climate change enabling sustainable development  Summary  The Paris Agreement contains a long-term temperature goal (LTTG) of holding the  increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit  this to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. The 1.5°C limit in the Paris Agreement goes  significantly further than the previous 2°C goal adopted under the UNFCCC. The Paris  Agreement also contains long-term global emissions goals to peak global emissions as  soon as possible and then reduce as rapidly as possible, according to the best available  science, to reach zero emissions globally in the second half of the 21st century.  The legally binding architecture of the agreement requires that countries must update and  increase the ambition of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) on a common  five-year cycle following a five-yearly global stock take. The Paris Agreement obliges  countries to progressively increase their level of ambition and action, as reflected in their  NDCs, so as to meet the long term temperature goal of the agreement (Mace, 2016).  This report provides an overview of three important issues arising from the Paris  agreement:  • Benefits of the 1.5°C limit in the Paris Agreement in terms of avoided global and  national climate impacts and risks;  • The global emission pathways needed to meet the Paris agreement’s long-term  temperature goal, including the required timing of peak global emissions and of  zero global emissions;  • The remaining carbon budget consistent with the 1.5°C limit in the Paris Agreement.  The global emission pathway issues and carbon budget are particularly important, as in  order to fulfil its climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, Australia’s present and  future actions on emission reductions will need to fit within these limits. Australia's initial  nationally determined contribution (INDC) is inadequate even for the former 2°C goal1. At  present the overall globally aggregated effect of INDCs and current policies put the world  on a 3°C or close to 4oC pathways respectively2, much above the previous 2°C limit. The  first review, or stock take, of the aggregate effect of all INDC commitments that countries  have put forward in relation to the 1.5°C limit in the Paris Agreement and the long term  global emission goals will occur in 2018 as part of facilitative dialogue agreed in Paris. The  2018 facilitative dialogue process will be informed by a specifically requested IPCC Special  Report on 1.5°C impacts and on how to close the gap between current policies, NDCs and  emission pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement in 2025 and 2030. Based on this,  by 2020 at the latest governments need to submit updated NDCs for 2025 and 2030 that  effectively close this gap. There is therefore an expectation that Australia improves its  emission reductions pledge to be consistent with the Paris Agreement and its enabling  decisions3. The government's 2017 review of climate policies and its promised  consideration of long term targets provides an important opportunity for strengthening  such commitments. The 2018 stocktake will be another crucial opportunity.  Limiting warming to 1.5°C provides key benefits compared to a 2°C limit  At present global warming is about 1°C above preindustrial levels. The world is already  experiencing substantial impacts and damages, including for agriculture, human  livelihoods and natural systems such as the Great Barrier Reef. Concerns that sustained  global warming of 2°C above pre-industrial would lead to very large impacts, damages and  risks led many vulnerable countries to express concern that the former 2°C limit was too  unsafe. These and other concerns led the world to adopt the Paris Agreement’s long-term  temperature goal, which includes a 1.5°C limit, as opposed to the earlier 2°C goal adopted  by the international community. Why has this come about?  Recent scientific literature shows that there is a significant increase in impacts and risks as  global-mean warming moves from 1.5°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. This seemingly  small difference in global average temperature represents a large addition of energy into  the global climate system and turns out to carry large consequences.  If the world warms by 1.5°C, currently rare climate related extremes (extreme heatwaves,  unusual dry spells, extreme rainfall, massive global coral bleaching events) would become  the new normal. If global mean warming were to reach 2°C, the climate system would  move into uncharted territory. For example, in a world that is 2°C warmer than preindustrial  levels, the typical annual length of warm spells would be up to 60 days longer  than today across northern parts of Australia and around 20 days longer across central  and southern regions. This increase would be reduced by at least 30%, if global warming is  limited to 1.5°C.  The 1.5°C limit would mean smaller increases in temperature of the annual hottest days,  reduced impacts on water availability and a smaller increases in length of dry spells, in  particular across southern, south-western and mid-western parts of Australia.  In light of the 2014-2016 massive global coral bleaching event (Eakin et al., 2016) that has  drastically affected the Great Barrier Reef4, it is especially critical to note that limiting  global warming to 1.5°C offers some chance for a fraction of the world’s coral reefs to  survive, while 2°C would provide very limited chance, if any at all.  Global sea level rise at 1.5°C warming would reach 40 cm above current levels by 2100,  compared to 50 cm at 2°C. However this does not take into account the longer-term post-  2100 commitment to further sea level rise, nor does it include the risk of crossing a  threshold to irreversible melt of parts of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, with  multi-metre sea level rise as a consequence. This risk is estimated to be much lower at  1.5°C than at 2°C.  In summary the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C marks the difference between the  upper end of present day climate variability and a new climatic regime of temperature and  water related extremes. In a country already experiencing temperatures exceeding 40°C in  its urban centres this is a very serious reason for concern for human health (Smith et al.,  2014). Along with a substantial drying trend projected in particular for southern part of  Australia this will negatively affect agricultural productivity (Reisinger et al., 2014) as well  as lead to increased risks of forest fires (Pitman, Narisma, & McAneney, 2007). Risks  under a 1.5°C warming would still be substantial but would alleviate several of the most  profound risks for coral reef degradation, extreme temperatures and drying projected for  2°C.  With early action, global emission reductions needed to meet the 1.5°C limit are  technically and economically feasible  Limiting warming to below 1.5°C requires qualitatively similar transformations in the  production and use of energy to those needed to hold warming below 2°C, however the  decarbonisation of the energy system needs to be faster and more pronounced.  For 1.5°C scenarios, zero CO2 emissions globally are needed by about 2050, and about ten  years later for 2°C scenarios, with global emissions peaking no later than about 2020  before rapidly declining.  For the world to get onto a 1.5°C pathway, the first and most urgent measures include the  rapid scaling up of renewable energy systems, energy efficiency, electrification of  transport systems, and improvements of industrial and building efficiency. Increased  energy efficiency at all levels is needed to reduce the growth in primary energy demand,    and renewables and other low-carbon energy systems are needed to decarbonise the  primary energy supply system rapidly.  Globally, the direct mitigation costs of 1.5°C scenarios are about 1.5-2 times higher over  the whole of the 21st century than the former 2°C goal, but as noted above the benefits  are vast.  Any global temperature limit is associated with a carbon budget - the allowed total of  global cumulative CO2 emissions in order to meet a given global warming goal. Historical  emissions to date and high levels of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at present (above  400 ppm CO2) mean that the remaining greenhouse gas (GHG) and carbon budgets are  very small. Limiting warming to 1.5°C (or 2°C) therefore now requires introducing negative  CO2 emissions at a small scale in the 2030s and scaling up thereafter. In addition,  sequestration of carbon in biological reservoirs, such as forests and soils, will also be  needed. The need for negative emission technologies by itself is not a differentiating  element between the 1.5°C limit and the previous 2°C limit.  This situation means that in the longer term (post 2030) technologies to remove CO2 from  the atmosphere play a key role, even with very rapid GHG reductions in the next 10 to 15  years. The scientific literature on emission pathways points to bioenergy with carbon  capture and storage (BECCS) as the most viable option at present (The Climate Institute,  2014), with the potential for large-scale deployment at limited economic costs. The  literature and models generally include considerations of interrelated land use issues,  such as food production, bioenergy, afforestation and reforestation. While BECCS will not  be without significant challenges (Fuss et al. 2014) with technological, sustainability,  social, political, and legal dimensions, this technology has the unique capability of  removing CO2 from the atmosphere and supplying energy at the same time.  Introduction  One of the outcomes of the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen (COP15) was an  agreement on a goal to hold warming below a 2°C increase above pre-industrial. However,  at Copenhagen more than 100 vulnerable countries were calling for limiting warming to  below 1.5°C. Recognising this, during the subsequent climate summit in Cancun (COP16) in  2010, the UNFCCC established a review process to evaluate whether the long-term global  temperature goal of holding warming below 2°C was adequate to avoid dangerous climate  change, and whether good progress was made towards achieving the long-term goal. The  review process focused in particular on the differences in impacts between 1.5°C and 2°C  warming above pre-industrial levels. This process ended in 2015 with the final report of its  scientific arm (a “Structured Expert Dialogue”) concluding that a warming of 2°C cannot be  considered safe and that 1.5°C is closer to being a safe ‘guardrail’ (UNFCCC, 2015).  This very important finding was reflected in the long-term temperature goal of the Paris  Agreement of holding the increase in the global average temperature well below 2°C and  pursuing efforts to limit this increase to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels. In Paris at COP21  Australia supported the inclusion of the 1.5°C limit in the Paris Agreement long termtemperature  goal.  On April 22nd 2016 in New York, Australia joined more than 170 other nations in signing  the Paris Agreement to deal with the global climate change problem and pledged to ratify  it in 2016. As the Australian government prepares to ratify the Paris Agreement, thus  committing itself to fulfil the obligations it entails, Australia’s emission reductions and  other actions need to be assessed in light of their compatibility with the Paris Agreement  temperature goal and other elements of the Agreement. The analysis in this paper  outlines the global emission envelope within which this assessment needs to take place in  order to meet the obligations of the Paris Agreement.  Comparison of climate impacts between  a 1.5°C and a 2°C world  Already with an observed warming of around 1°C, the impacts of anthropogenic climate  change are felt globally. Temperatures and sea level are on the rise (IPCC, 2013), extreme  weather events are increasing in intensity and frequency (IPCC, 2012), with largely  detrimental effects on global agriculture (Lesk, Rowhani, & Ramankutty, 2016; Porter et  al., 2014) and atmospheric CO2 levels are highest in millions of years, leading to gradually  worsening ocean acidification (IPCC, 2014). Severe impacts on marine life, including  erosion and mass bleaching of tropical coral reefs, are the consequence of already    observed ocean acidification and increasing temperatures (J.- P. Gattuso et al., 2015).  During the 2015-2016 El Niño event, mass bleaching has affected vast parts of the Great  Barrier Reef (Normille, 2016). In addition, there is growing evidence that parts of the West  Antarctic ice sheet, a “tipping element” of the Earth System (Lenton et al., 2008), may  already be in irreversible retreat, implying additional sea level rise of at least one meter  over centuries to come (Feldmann & Levermann, 2015; Joughin, Smith, & Medley, 2014;  Rignot, Mouginot, Morlighem, Seroussi, & Scheuchl, 2014).  Ocean, cryosphere and global sea level rise  As explained below, physical impacts on oceans and the cryosphere (Antarctic and  Greenland ice sheets, small icecaps and mountain glaciers) differ considerably between  1.5°C and 2°C warming in relation to both gradual impacts and to the risk of abrupt shifts  of so-called “tipping elements” (Lenton et al., 2008). Tipping elements in the Earth System  are characterised by internal self-amplifying dynamics that may lead to a complete change  in its state. Such dynamics are triggered above a certain global mean temperature  increase, or the tipping point.  A recent study analysing tipping elements in the Earth System, including ocean circulation  and sea ice patterns in climate models, found that 2°C warming would already cross about  50% of all tipping points identified in these models for any level of warming (Drijfhout et  al., 2015). This number is reduced to about 20% if warming is limited to 1.5°C. Besides  those associated with sea level rise, other tipping elements assessed include large-scale  forest dieback of the Amazon and boreal (high latitude) forests, permafrost collapse,  vegetation shifts in Africa’s Eastern Sahel region, and disappearance of Arctic sea ice.  Most relevant for this section are potential tipping points for large scale ice sheet  disintegration of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. The West Antarctic (Feldmann &  Levermann, 2015) as well as parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (Mengel & Levermann,  2014) are at substantial risk of disintegration due to ocean-ice sheet interactions. This  could result in additional sea level rise of 6-8 meters over time scales of several centuries  to millennia (Deconto & Pollard, 2016). Although oceanic warming around Antarctica is  projected to increase with increasing global warming (Hellmer, Kauker, Timmermann,  Determann, & Rae, 2012), our current understanding of these changes does not allow for  a quantification of the precise levels of global mean temperature increase to which the  potential tipping points can be linked.  The Greenland ice sheet is more directly vulnerable to increases in atmospheric  temperatures and researchers have identified 1.6°C warming as the best estimate for a  critical threshold for a tipping of the Greenland ice sheet (Robinson, Calov, & Ganopolski,  2012). A disintegration of the Greenland ice sheet could lead to up to 7 m sea level rise    over thousands of years. Assessments of past sea level evidence from earth history and  state-of-the-art modelling results indicate an average multi-millennial average sea level  rise of about 2.3 m per °C of warming (Levermann et al., 2013).  Projections for 21st century sea level rise are displayed in Figure 1 (Schleussner et al.,  2016). The best estimate for 21st century sea level rise under a 2°C scenario is about 50  cm, which is 10 cm less under a 1.5°C scenario. Possibly even more important are the  rates of sea level rise in 2100, as they will largely influence a post-2100 commitment to  long-term sea level rise. Only under a 1.5°C scenario are these rates in decline by 2100,  reaching present day levels by that time. Note, however, that these assessments do not  account yet for the effect of potential rapid ice sheet disintegration discussed above, nor  do they identify vulnerabilities related to different rates of rise regionally or increases in  sea level variability that may be influenced by global warming (Widlansky, Timmermann,  & Cai, 2015).  Tropical coral reefs  Tropical coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to climate change. They are threatened by  ocean acidification (Pandolfi et al., 2003) and intense coral bleaching as a result of oceanic  warming (Meissner, Lippmann, & Sen Gupta, 2012). Figure 2 displays the fraction of global  tropical coral reefs projected to be at risk of long-term degradation, understood as an  eventual loss of the reef ecosystem, due to severe bleaching events occurring at least  Figure 1: Probabilistic projections of global sea level rise relative to 1986-2005 levels (lower panels) for  a 1.5°C temperature scenario (left) and a 2°C scenario (right panels). Thick lines indicate median  estimates whereas dark coloured ranges indicate the 66% likelihood range and light coloured ranges  the 90% likelihood range. Median estimates for 2100 sea level rise under 1.5°C is about 10cm less than  the 50cm projected for 2°C. From Schleussner et al. (2016).    every five years for 1.5°C and 2°C. Unless extremely optimistic scenarios of coral reef  adaptation are assumed, virtually all tropical coral reefs will be at severe risk of  degradation under 2°C warming. The warming difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is likely  to be decisive for the future survival of tropical coral reefs and only the 1.5°C scenario  offers some potential for these ecosystems to adapt. The already observed coral bleaching  illustrates the magnitude and scale of this risk for the Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage  site, that has already lost more than 50% of its coral cover since 1985 (Gattuso, Hoegh-  Guldberg, & Pörtner, 2014). This loss will have widespread and detrimental consequences  for livelihoods of communities depending on it. Coral reefs provide coastal protection,  account for more than 10% of fish caught in tropical countries (20% of developing  countries) and the Great Barrier Reef itself generates about A$ 5.4 billion in tourism  revenue annually to the Australian economy (Gattuso et al., 2014).  Figure 2: Probabilistic projections of the share of global ocean grid cells with tropical  coral reefs at risk of long-term degradation under a 1.5°C scenario (top) and a 2°C  scenario (bottom, for the temperature trajectories, see (Schleussner et al., 2016). This  is assessed over all ocean grid cells currently containing coral reefs. The figure  displays the share for assumptions about future evolution of temperature resilience  of coral reefs. Whereas the “Constant”-case assumes observed levels of coral  susceptibility to increased water temperatures, the “Thermal Adaptation” case  assumes unprecedented and rapid adaptation of these ecosystems. As this appears to  be very optimistic given the detrimental effects of ocean acidification to tropical coral  reef calcification rates (thereby weakening these systems considerably), these  projections represent the absolute lower bound of future tropical coral reef risk. From  Schleussner et al. (2016).    Impacts of 1.5°C and 2°C warming on Australia  Australia is exposed to climate change impacts, including sea level rise and coral reef loss,  but also to extreme weather events and drying trends (Reisinger et al., 2014). The analysis  below builds on a recent global study that investigated differences between 1.5°C and 2°C  warming for a range of climate indicators (Schleussner et al., 2016).  Extreme Weather Events  In recent years the world has experienced a profound increase in frequency and intensity  of extreme weather events due to anthropogenic climate change (IPCC, 2012). Described  below are the results for four different extreme weather event indicators: extreme  temperature, warm spells, dry spells (meteorological droughts) and extreme precipitation  (Zhang et al., 2011):  • Intensity of hot extremes (TXx): How much hotter would the hottest day in a year become?  The indicator used here is the annual maximum value of daily maximum temperature. This is a  good indicator for the increase in extreme high temperatures.  • Warm spell duration indicator (WSDI): How much longer would a currently typical series of hot  days become? The indicator here is the annual count of the longest consecutive period in which  the daily maximum temperature for each day exceeds the 90% quantile for this day over the  reference period. The minimum length is six consecutive days. This is a good indicator for heatwaves  occurrence.  • Dry spell length or consecutive dry days (CDD): How much longer would dry periods become?  The indicator here is the maximum number of consecutive days for which the precipitation is  below 1 mm per day in a year. This is a good indicator for meteorological drought.  • Heavy precipitation intensity (RX5day): How much heavier would heavy rainfall periods  become? The indicator here is the annual maximum of rainfall over a consecutive 5-day period.  This is a good indicator for flooding risk.  The analysis has been performed on ensembles of state-of-the-art climate models from  the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5, 11 models for temperature  extremes, 14 models for precipitation extremes; for more information about the  methodology see (Schleussner et al., 2016)). The model median results for each of these  indicators are displayed in Figure 3 for 1.5°C and 2°C warming, as well as the difference  between the two warming levels.  A warming of 2°C would imply a substantial increase in temperature related extremes:  annual extreme temperatures would exceed 3°C above values typically experienced during  the recent past (1986-2005) and the annual mean length of warm spells (also relative to  the 1986-2005 period) would last around 20 days for central and southern part of  Australia and up to 60 days in the northern part of Australia.  Under 1.5°C warming, this increase in intensity and length of extreme temperature events  is less pronounced compared to 2°C. Increase in the intensity of annual hot extremes (TXx)    would be limited to about 2°C above the 1986-2005 reference period and warm spells  would be up to 15 days for the central and southern parts of Australia and up to about  30-40 days for the northern part of Australia.  Note that the extreme increases indicated in the northern part of Australia and coastal  grid-cells arise from the fact that most of the underlying grid cells contain dominantly  ocean and not land. This could be overcome by downscaling global climate model results  for these regions to achieve higher resolution, e.g. in a dynamical downscaling approach  (Australian Bureau of Meteorology and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research  Organisation (CSIRO), 2011). As natural temperature variability over the oceans is much  smaller than over land, the resulting increase in warm spell duration, an extreme event  index developed for land, is particularly pronounced and should be interpreted with  caution.  Figure 3: Projections for changes in extreme weather event indicators relative to the  1986-2005 reference period. Grey marked areas indicate regions, where less than 66% of  the models in the ensemble investigated agree on the sign of change.    Projections for precipitation-related indices indicate substantial uncertainty in future  changes of precipitation-related extremes, for both extreme wet and dry events (grey  areas in Figure 3). However, significant differences exist in particular related to extreme  precipitation events in the northern part of Australia that are projected to intensify by 7-  10% compared to less than 5% under a 1.5°C warming. In spite of such heavier rainfall  events, a robust increase in drying is projected for large parts of Australia under a 2°C  warming. The currently longest annual dry spell would become up to 2 weeks longer  (compare Figure 3, bottom panel). The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C in the length of  dry spells is particularly pronounced in the southern, south-western and mid-western  parts of Australia. An overview of this comparison of changes in extreme events at 1.5°C  and 2°C are given in  Table 1.  Water availability  In addition to changes in extreme weather events, Australia is particularly prone to longterm  drying trends. Here, we analyse changes in annual water availability (total runoff,  Qtot) based on the climate impact model intercomparison project ISI-MIP (Schewe et al.,  2014). The projections presented are based on 5 bias-corrected climate projections with  state-of-the-art climate models and 11 hydrological models comprising, in total, a model  ensemble of 55 models.  Under a 1.5°C scenario, we find a reduction in annual water availability of about 10% for  most parts of Australia, with reduction in annual water availability in western parts of  Australia exceeding 15% (Figure 4). Under 2°C, water availability is projected to continue  to decrease across the southern half of the continent and is most pronounced in the  south-eastern and south-western and Pilbara regions. Reductions exceed 20% for western  parts of Australia. In the northern third of the continent our results indicate a reversal in  the projected trend towards a slight wetting, probably related to monsoon intensification.  It is, however, important to underscore that these projections are uncertain and even  reductions exceeding 40% (30%) are still within the ‘likely’ (66% probability) range of  projections for a 2°C (1.5°C) warming.  Table 1: Changes in temperature and precipitation related extreme event indices projected at 1.5°C and 2°C  warming from Schleussner et al. (2016). The median change experienced by 50% of the land-area is given for  the northern part of Australia (North of 30°S) and the southern part Australia (South of 30°C and including  Tasmania and New Zealand). The likely range over the model ensemble (66% likelihood) is indicated in  square brackets. Changes in WSDI are expressed in days and RX5day, CDD, as well as Qtot in % change. All  changes are assessed relative to the 1986-2005 reference period.      Comparison of global mitigation  pathways between a 1.5°C and a 2°C  world  Integrated Assessment Models of Climate Change (IAMs) provide information on the  complex interrelation between the economy, energy use and the global climate. Some of  the most important insights IAMs offer at a system level relate to the energy system  transformation necessary for achieving a specific climate target – such as limiting global  mean temperature increase to 1.5°C or hold warming below 2°C above preindustrial  levels. Energy system transformation means, in essence, a shift away from the reliance on  fossil fuels, towards renewables on the energy supply side, combined with energy  efficiency improvements on the demand side. IAMs provide estimates of the direct cost of  climate change mitigation, compared to a baseline scenario without climate policy. Much  research shows that these direct mitigation costs are expected to be partially, or fully  balanced by the benefits of mitigation, in particular economic co-benefits of mitigation  (e.g. reduced air pollution effects on human health and agriculture due to reduced use of  fossil fuels) and avoided climate change. IAMs in general do not account for co-benefits  or damages from climate change.  The energy system transformations necessary to limit warming to less than either 1.5°C or  2°C are very similar, but deployment of low, zero and negative carbon energy supply  options needs to happen faster in the 1.5°C limit case so that emission reduction can be  realised earlier (Rogelj, Luderer, et al., 2015; Schaeffer et al., n.d.). This is associated with  1.5-2 times higher costs over the century as a whole, with costs higher in the next few  decades, rather than later in the century (Rogelj, Luderer, et al. 2015).  Baseline, 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios  This section assesses global total CO2 and GHG emissions for three scenarios from the  MESSAGE model5 (base, 1.5°C and 2°C) and compares these for GHGs with historical data  and two projections of the effects of current policies (CAT high and CAT low) from the  Climate Action Tracker (CAT). The CAT high and CAT low scenarios describe the range of  emission pathways that can be expected to result from a continuation of current climate  policies, in a bottom-up global aggregation of country-level assessments. It is important  to note that an assessment of the effects reductions pledges and INDCs (Intended  Nationally Determined Contributions) that countries put forward in 2015 during the Paris  Agreement negotiations result in most cases in lower emissions than current policies.  In the MESSAGE baseline scenario, no global temperature goal is assumed.  To characterise policies consistent with the 2°C goal adopted in the Copenhagen Accords  in 2009 we draw from existing emissions pathways that hold the increase in global  average temperature below 2°C with at least a likely probability (>66%). At present most  emission pathways that come close to the 1.5°C limit, exceed an increase of 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels during the 21st century, before dropping to the 1.5°C limit by 2100. In  this study we have used one of the lowest scenarios available that limit warming to 1.5°C  by 2100 with a probability of more than 50 % (and holds warming below 2oC with about an  85% probability). This should not be seen as an interpretation of the 1.5°C limit in the  Paris Agreement. A new generation of scenarios are being developed which may not  exceed 1.5°C, however these were not yet available for this report.  Probabilities of staying below the given warming threshold are computed using the  reduced complexity global climate-carbon cycle model MAGICC (Meinshausen, Raper, &  Wigley, 2011), in the same methodology as was applied for IPCC’s Fifth Assessment  Report, and accounts for uncertainties in important climate-related parameters – e.g.  climate sensitivity and carbon–cycle characteristics – by returning probabilistic  temperature responses.  The MESSAGE scenarios were taken from an ensemble of scenarios used in peer-reviewed  publications (Rogelj, McCollum, Reisinger, Meinshausen, & Riahi, 2013; Rogelj, Mccollum,  & Riahi, 2013) and selected for their inter-scenario comparability:  • Scenarios share the same assumptions regarding substantial improvements in energy  efficiency – energy demand is comparatively low already in the baseline scenario. In the  short to medium term, GHG emissions are well in line with the current policy CAT low  scenario, which gives the lower estimate of global emissions for a world in which currently  (2015) implemented climate policies where continued. This would lead to about 3.3°C of  global warming until 21006 and in the long term tend to be considerably higher than this.  Global warming resulting from such a baseline can therefore be considered to be well above  3.3°C in 2100.  • Climate policy fully compatible with the respective temperature goals only begins from 2020  in these scenarios. This is in line with the current state of affairs regarding climate policy.  Accelerated policies leading to higher mitigation pre-2020 remain feasible and would result  in slightly lower rates of reduction post 2020 required to still achieve the long-term  temperature goal.  The MESSAGE baseline scenario, which assumes the absence of global climate policy to  limit warming to any certain level, shows a decline in CO2 emissions towards the end of    the century. This is mainly due to assumed constraints in fossil fuel availability at  prices/cost that can compete with projected decreasing prices for renewable energy  supply, however by that time warming has reached around 3.5°C.Table 2 shows relative  changes in global CO2 and GHG emissions levels in 2030 and 2050, relative to 2005 levels,  and per capita emissions levels. This emphasises again the need for global zero CO2  emissions and major reductions in GHG emissions by around 2050 in order to limit  warming to 1.5°C. It also shows the vast discrepancy between the goals laid out in the  Paris Agreement and what countries around the world are currently doing – the latter can  be seen for GHG emissions in the CAT high and low scenarios. Also, the MESSAGE baseline  scenario assumes a more optimistic development compared to the CAT high scenario and  is relatively close to the CAT low scenario.    1) The CAT global assessment () does not specify global population data. Therefore, the  Medium scenario from the United Nations World Population prospects 2015 () was used for global  population numbers in 2030 and 2050. Given the long-term emission pathways of CAT are derived from IPCC Fifth Assessment Report  scenarios, which are also often associated with UN population projections, this is a reasonable approach, but it must be noted that  population projections are highly uncertain and alternative assumptions would give different per-capita emission values.  2)CAT global assessment considers only total GHGs. Therefore, no CO2 could be computed.  Global emission reductions for the Paris Agreement  With climate policy in place, total GHG emissions (the sum of CO2 emissions and global  warming potential (GWP)7 weighted non-CO2 GHG emissions) need to decline rapidly to  reach globally aggregated zero emissions and then become negative in the latter part of  the 21st century. Negative total GHGs emissions result from negative CO2 emissions  outweighing the remaining non-CO2 GHG emissions: CO2 emissions need to become  negative shortly after 2060 in the 2°C scenarios and around 2050 in the 1.5°C scenarios  (Figure 5)8.  Table 3 shows the remaining budgets until the end of the 21st century, for both of the  climate policy scenarios and as an indication of the overall mitigation efforts, also for the  baseline. The so called threshold avoidance budgets (Rogelj et al., 2016) in the last two  columns are the cumulative CO2 or GHG emissions between 2015 and 2100 that limit the  global temperature increase by 2100 to below a certain value with a given probability  (66% for 2°C, 50% for 1.5°C). As mentioned above, key climate-system uncertainties are  included in these probability estimates, such as uncertainties in climate sensitivity and  carbon–cycle characteristics. In addition, the ranges drawn from the literature are  provided to put the scenarios central in this report in context, indicating some of the  uncertainties related to, for example, relative costs of technologies across models, early vs  late reductions, CO2 vs non-CO2 reductions etc.  Carbon budget  Compared to the baseline scenario, cumulative emissions of over 3000 Gt CO2 need to be  avoided to hold warming below 2°C. For the 1.5°C by 2100 scenarios, this number rises to  nearly 3500 GtCO2 to be avoided.  Put another way, the remaining global carbon budget for the 1.5oC over the period 2015-  2100 scenario is less than 250 GtCO2 (245 GtCO2). It is critical to understand that this is  net budget over the century as the 1.5°C by 2100 scenario emits 775 GtCO2 from 2015-  2050 and then with negative emissions technologies and biological carbon sequestration  take 530 GtCO2 out of the atmosphere from 2051-2100.  Both the speed and the overall degree of mitigation are less pronounced for total GHGs.  Whilst it is generally understood that the emission reduction possibilities from non-CO2  GHG emissions are not as great as from CO2 emissions from the energy system, it is also  clear that there remains a substantial degree of uncertainty about the ability to reduce  emissions in these areas. Different IAM models assume very different emission reduction  possibilities (Gernaat et al., 2015), and this issue is reflected by the ranges included in the  table. If reduction possibilities for non-CO2 GHGs are greater than assumed then  corresponding CO2 budgets are higher, and vice versa (Rogelj, Reisinger, et al., 2015).  An advantage of illustrating budgets using a single model framework is the robust likewith-  like comparison between the scenarios, because any change in certain assumed  model parameters like, for instance, technology specific investment cost will always affect  all scenarios and therefore shift the results of all scenarios – this is the so called baselin-eeffect.  Table 3: Year of globally zero emissions (approximate) and emissions budgets, Sources: IPCC AR5, UNEP Emissions Gap  Report (2014), IIASA (Rogelj et al 2015; 2016), own calculations.  1) Year of zero emissions as reported in UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2014 based on re-analysis of IPCC AR5 emissions  scenarios that reach 2020 global GHG emissions levels consistent with INDC analysis.  2) CO2 budgets in IPCC AR5 WGIII are for 2011 onwards, hence adjusted here by subtracting 160 GtCO2 of past emissions  2011-2015 (Rogelj et al 2016) – the IPCC AR5 scenario database includes many scenarios that reach 2020 global GHG  emissions levels considerably below levels consistent with NDCs and hence the CO2 budgets reported for AR5 amount  typically to lower levels of total cumulative emissions in the 2016-2050 period than the scenarios selected for detailed  analysis in this report. IPCC AR5 did not report budgets for total GHGs, nor for the 2051-2100 period.  3) Re-analysis of scenario data from UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2014 based on Rogelj et al (2015). UNEP EGR did not  report budgets for total GHGs  Need for negative CO2 emissions  IAM findings currently point to the need for large-scale carbon uptake activities and  negative emission technologies to achieve these climate goals. Major contributions in  existing scenarios to carbon uptake (sequestering in biological carbon reservoirs) come  from afforestation & reforestation. Negative CO2 emissions in the present generation of  IAM models derive from technologies combining bioenergy with carbon capture and  storage (BECCS) (Gough & Upham, 2011) which uses biomass to fuel thermal power  plants for provision of electricity and then stores the CO2 from the combustion  underground, and at this stage is identified in the scientific literature as the most likely  available negative emissions option with potential to grow to large-scale deployment at  limited economic costs.  Like most other IAMs of the current model generation, the MESSAGE model includes a  coherent representation of the land-use sector and biomass availability, approximately  considering inter-related land use issues, such as food production, bioenergy,  afforestation and reforestation. In parallel to negative emissions through BECCS, the low  emission scenarios from MESSAGE also include sequestration through afforestation and  reforestation, reaching cumulative sequestration of around 220-230 GtCO2 by the end of  the century in the Paris Agreement 1.5°C and Cancun Agreements 2°C scenarios. While  BECCS will not be without its challenges (Fuss et al., 2014) with technological,  sustainability, social, political, legal and legislative dimensions, it has the unique capability  of removing CO2 from the atmosphere while at the same time supplying energy.  BECCS is a combination of already known technologies – thermal power plants fired with  biofuel, capture of CO2 from the combustion gases and then transport and storage in  secure geological formations (Metz, Davidson, de Coninck, Loos, & Meyer, 2005), but has  not yet been deployed on a large scale (Gough & Upham, 2011). BECCS can be  categorised as a negative emissions technology because it extracts CO2 from the air as an  integral part of an energy production system. Plants take up and store carbon during  growth through photosynthesis. When either forest & agricultural residues, or dedicated  bioenergy crops, are harvested and combusted in power plants, and the resulting CO2  emissions are captured and stored underground, this results in a net extraction of CO2  from the atmosphere, while providing energy services.  Another option for negative emissions is direct air capture (DAC) (Broehm, Strefler, &  Bauer, 2015), where CO2 is extracted from ambient or near ambient atmospheric  concentrations and stored in a geological reservoir. The economic costs of this are  estimated to be far greater than BECCS (McLaren, 2011), which is why this option at this  stage does not generally play a role in IAM scenarios. DAC has the advantage that it is  limited only by the amount of energy and storage available, and not also by the amount of  land that is required as with BECCS.  As is the case with direct air capture, other means of taking CO2 from the air and  sequestering in biological carbon reservoirs, including reforestation, afforestation and  increased CO2 uptake by soils, do not supply the additional benefit of energy output. Some  of these may, however, provide other services, such as water basin management, or soil  improvements. Land use objective conflicts can also arise where a priority on carbon  storage in forests may conflict with biodiversity, water management, cultural and land  scape values, as is the case with bioenergy systems. As mentioned above, in most of the  scenarios for limiting warming to below 2°C and 1.5°C significant carbon sequestration in    the terrestrial biosphere is assumed, and negative CO2 emissions from industrial processes  such as BECCS are required in addition to this.  Discussion and Conclusions  Recent scientific developments show that there are considerable benefits to limiting  warming increase to 1.5°C compared to 2°C. The difference in global mean temperature  increase between 1.5°C and 2°C has substantial implications for key climate impacts and  indicators for Australia. Projections of future coral bleaching indicate that the 0.5°C  temperature difference might be decisive for the survival of the coral reefs worldwide and  in particular the Great Barrier Reef (Frieler et al., 2012). Recent in situ and modelling  results of the thermal tolerance of reef-building corals in the Great Barrier Reef has shown  that this protective mechanism is likely to be lost under warming scenarios exceeding  1.5°C, further amplifying the degradation risk of the system (Ainsworth et al., 2016). This  concern is further reinforced by the recent estimation that unabated warming is likely to  render the recent extreme temperature anomalies that prevailed during March 2016 as  new normal temperatures in the Coral Sea region covering the northern sectors of the  Great Barrier Reef by the mid-2030s.  As demonstrated in this report, the difference between 1.5°C and 2°C marks the  difference between the upper end of present day climate variability and a new climatic  regime in relation to temperature and water related extremes. In a country already  experiencing temperatures exceeding 40°C in its urban centres, this is a very serious  reason for concern for human health as well as labour productivity (Smith et al., 2014). In  combination with a substantial drying trend projected in particular for southern Australia  and in particular the South-West Land Division of Western Australia, this will negatively  affect agricultural productivity (Reisinger et al., 2014) as well as lead to increased risks of  grassland and forest fires (Pitman et al., 2007). Risks under a 1.5°C warming would still be  substantial but would alleviate several of the most profound risks for coral reef  degradation, extreme temperatures and drying projected for 2°C.  Limiting warming to below 1.5°C requires similar energy system transformations to those  needed to hold warming below 2°C but the global decarbonisation of the energy system  needs to be faster and more pronounced.  The critical developments in the next 5 to 15 years, if the world is to get onto a 1.5°  pathway (or even a 2°C pathway), is a more rapid deployment of renewable energy and  low, zero and negative emission energy supply technologies. This involves a more rapid  retirement of existing emission-intensive energy system components and a corresponding  rapid upscaling in zero-emission and highly efficient technologies.  In the longer term (post 2030) technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere play a  considerable role in existing emission scenarios for achieving either 1.5°C or 2°C, and the  need for these by itself does not appear to be a differentiating element between the 1.5°C  limit and higher levels of warming. Depending upon the success in deployment of  renewable energy, energy efficiency, electrification of transport systems and reductions in  non-CO2 GHG emissions, low scale deployment of negative emissions technologies would  need to start in the late 2020s early 2030s. The scientific literature at present points to  BECCS as the most likely available option with potential to grow to large-scale deployment  at limited economic costs.  Given the uncertainties surrounding the potential for negative emissions technologies to  be deployed at scale, it would seem prudent that policy aims to minimise the need for  this. Even with rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency, with very  rapid emission reductions between now and 2050 the physical presence of so much CO2 in  the atmosphere due to past human activities means some level of negative emissions is  virtually unavoidable at this stage if the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal is to  be met. As a consequence, it is important that the initial and most urgent focus on Paris  Agreement compatible policy actions is on the rapid deployment of renewable and other  low or zero carbon energy systems, combined with rapid improvements in energy  efficiency of industry, building and housing, and electrification of transport systems."
ClimateInstitute-5.txt,"The  Climate  Institute  COP 22 — Getting to Zero:  Implementation of Paris Agreement  for Net Zero Emissions    November 2016  The Climate Institute is Australia's leading climate policy and advocacy specialist. Backed primarily through philanthropic funding, the Institute has been making solutions to climate change possible through evidence based advocacy and research, since 2005.  We have bold, ambitious goals and a track record of getting difficult things done through our strategic partnerships as well as our research.  In just over a month the government will start a long awaited review of its climate policies, including its post-2030 emissions reduction targets. This is our chance to choose a different future.  Please support our 2017 Impact Appeal.    Our chance to choose a different future, now.  Summary  Momentum  In August 2015, Australia put forward an initial target of a 26-28 per cent reduction in emissions, below 2005 levels, by 2030. If other countries followed this example, it would lead to warming of 3-4°C above pre-industrial levels.  In December 2015 in Paris, Australia and all countries – rich and poor, large and small – agreed to take action to limit long-term warming to 1.5-2°C, achieve net zero emissions of greenhouse gases and increase resilience to the emerging impacts of climate change.  Australia’s initial target will need to be revisited in  2019-2020, at the latest, as part of the process agreed in Paris that increases ambition towards the central objectives of the Agreement. Achieving these warming goals will require countries like Australia to be at net zero emissions before 2050.  Since Paris, momentum to implement the Paris Agreement – and take other global action to reduce emissions – has been unprecedented (See Timeline).  + On 4 November, the Paris Agreement will enter force within a year of being adopted. This is historic speed for an agreement of this scope. It took the Kyoto Protocol around eight years to come into force.  + Outside the central United Nations (UN) climate change process, Paris sparked momentum for countries to come to separate agreements to reduce emissions from international aviation, and phase down the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a super-greenhouse gas.  + National governments and investors are responding to the Paris Agreement. For example, the United Kingdom (UK) has agreed to reduce emissions by 57 per cent by 2030 and the Canadian government is imposing a nation wide carbon price floor. In a “landmark” paper published in September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said investors should incorporate climate change risks into their portfolios.  + Conservative estimates from the International Energy Agency now indicate that world renewable energy capacity now exceeds coal electricity capacity, and renewable output is expected to provide over 60 per cent of total growth in electricity generation to 2021.  Despite this rapid progress, the world is still not on track to achieve the central objectives of the Paris Agreement. Current commitments would led to an estimated 3°C of warming.  Last month’s State of the Climate report from CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology highlighted Australia’s growing, costly, climate impacts with even 1°C of warming since 1910 (see Box 2). Our national interest lies in all countries stepping up, and strengthening, their 2030 and later emissions reductions policies and targets as part of the Paris process (see Key elements of the Paris Agreement).  Defining the rule book  The Paris Agreement set the framework for global action towards achieving net zero emissions. It also outlined what elements of a detailed rulebook for global cooperation were to be defined over the coming few years. These include the transparency of policies to reduce emissions and provide financial support for poor nations, the operation of global carbon markets, and tracking the impact of collective action towards the objectives of the Agreement. By making good progress on these rules, and plans to assist poorer countries facing climate impacts, Marrakech is an important opportunity for governments to ensure that the details of the Paris Agreement can be agreed to by 2018.  Building a net zero emissions future  While the government has declared the Paris Agreement is in our national interest, the long-term implications of the Paris Agreement have yet to sink into Australia’s mainstream political and media discourse, or into domestic policy making.  There are some positive exceptions, Australia has agreed to participate in the international emissions trading mechanism for international aviation and is implementing policies to phase down HFCs in advance of international agreements.  However, overall, policy makers and the media continue to largely focus on the short-term, or at best, just the initial 2030 targets Australia put forward in 2015. This is increasing major transition risks for Australia’s community and economy. For example, recent controversy over renewable energy and energy security has largely failed to recognise Australia’s commitment to the Paris Agreement requires the modernisation and decarbonisation of our electricity system before 2050.  The central commitments governments, including Australia, made in Paris were to limit long-term warming to 1.5-2°C, achieve net zero emissions, and increase resilience to the emerging impacts of climate change.  • In 2015, the Abbott government committed internationally that the 2017 review of climate policies would also consider Australia’s post-2030 target. This review of policies and the post-2030 emissions pathway represents the first chance for a credible national policy conversation in five years, and the first chance for a bipartisan outcomes in almost a decade. It is a critical opportunity to properly integrate climate, energy and economic policy, and fully participate in international climate efforts.  This can be achieved, but will require policymakers to put aside the politics and division of the last few decades and acknowledge we need to face the realities of a net zero emissions world.  Next steps  The immediate next steps for the government should be:  + Ratification of the Paris Agreement in Marrakesh.  + Deliver on its promise to release 2030 emissions projections this year, and do so well before Christmas.  + Ensure the 2017 review, and related COAG energy processes, will consider credible policy to help grow a net zero emissions economy before 2050. This will need to include inclusive social and economic strategies to steadily replace coal fired power stations over the next 15 years.  • Box 1: Australia in the spotlight  On 12 November at Marrakech, Australia will take its turn in what is known as the multilateral assessment process where other countries ask questions of each other. This is an important process to build trust and ambition between countries. Pre-published questions show many other countries – like many Australians – are interested, if not unclear, about Australia’s current climate and energy policy direction. Countries are awaiting key data, like the 2030 emissions projections which it promised in 2016.  • In December last year, the world negotiated and  adopted the historic Paris Agreement on climate  change.1 For the first time, all countries – rich and poor,  large and small – agreed to take universal action to  limit global warming to 1.5-2°C, to achieve net zero  emissions, and to increase resilience to the emerging  impacts of climate change (see Key elements of the  Paris Agreement, page 5).  The first formal meeting of parties to the Paris  Agreement will take place in Marrakech, Morocco from  the 7th to the 14th of November. This brief gives context  to this meeting, outlines key issues that will need to  addressed, and discusses the implications for Australia.  Momentum, momentum, momentum  Momentum to implement the Paris Agreement, and  take other global action to reduce emissions, has been  unprecedented.  In February, over 170 nations, including Australia, signed  the Paris Agreement at a high level ceremony in New  York, an event unprecedented in the history of multilateral  agreements. By October, 87 countries accounting for 6per cent of global emissions had ratified the Agreement.This means the Agreement will enter legal force within  a year of being made. During negotiations it was widely  assumed that it would take until at least 2018 for this to  happen, as historically it can take some time for countries  to ratify international agreements through their domestic  processes.  Box 2: Climate change hits home  in Australia  The most recent State of the Climate report from  CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology2 clearly  demonstrates why climate action is in Australia’s  interests. Some key points in that report include:  + Australia has warmed by around 1°C since 1910.  + The number of days per year over 35°C has  increased in recent decades, except in parts of  northern Australia.  + There has been an increase in extreme fire weather,  and a longer fire season, across large parts of  Australia.  + April–October growing season rainfall has reduced  by around 11 per cent since the mid-1990s in the  continental southeast of Australia.  + The overwhelming contribution to the additional  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is from human  activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels.  + The atmospheric CO2 increases in 2015 were the  highest ever observed.  In August, The Climate Institute released research  on the implications for Australia of the 1.5°C and 2°C  warming goals in the Paris Agreement.3 That research  indicated warming of 1.5°C would see current extreme  heat waves, droughts and mass coral bleaching  events on the Great Barrier Reef becoming the new  normal. At 2°C, our global climate system would move  from the upper end of present day climate variability  into uncharted territory, resulting in extreme, costly  and dangerous impacts for Australia.  Introduction  Outside the central UN climate change process, Paris sparked momentum for countries to come to an agreement on reducing emissions from international aviation, which will commence in 2021. Over 190 countries, including the world’s two largest emitters, the United States (US) and China, have signed up to limit emissions from international airline travel. Over, 65 countries, including Australia, have agreed to participate in the global emissions trading scheme associated with this agreement.A few weeks later, countries agreed a phase down the use of HFCs, a super-greenhouse gas, to levels that would knock off nearly half a degree of possible future global warming.Financial authorities are also taking note of the Paris Agreement. The G20’s Financial Stability Board in December 2015 announced a taskforce to develop a set of standard climate-related disclosures.7 This financial disclosure framework, which will be released in draft form in December, will be an unprecedented demonstration from the world’s biggest financial authorities that climate change has considerable implications for markets and investors which need to be understood and disclosed to minimise risks the global financial system.  From words to action  The impact of the Paris Agreement has been felt outside formal multilateral governmental processes.  Investors are increasingly incorporating carbon and climate change risks into the decisions they make. Norway’s oil fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, has ceased investing in 52 companies that are heavily reliant on thermal coal.In a “landmark” paper published in September, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said investors should incorporate climate change risks into their portfolios.9 BlackRock manages assets with a value around five times the size of the Australian economy.  National governments are also responding. For example, the UK, even after the Brexit referendum, has agreed to reduce emissions by 57 per cent by 203010 and the Canadian government is imposing a nationwide carbon price floor (See Timeline, page 6).Global investments, technology innovation and cost reductions continue in clean energy. In 2015, for the first time, renewable energy overtook coal in terms of cumulative installed capacity around the world.12 Conservative estimates from the International Energy Agency now indicated that world renewable energy output is expected to provide over 60 per cent of total electricity generation growth to 2021.  More work to do  Despite this rapid progress, the world is not on track to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Countries current commitments would see the world warm by around 3°C.13 Although this is better than the 4-6°C degrees of warming projected prior to the Paris talks, the world is still well above the objectives of the agreement to limit long-term warming to 1.5-2°C.  This highlights the importance of countries stepping up their 2030 emissions reductions targets as part of the Paris process in 2019-2020. This is particularly relevant to Australia, whose current 2030 target is consistent with global warming of 3-4°C and would leave us as  one of the highest per capita emitters in the G20 in 2030 (Figure 1).In December 2015, Australia and all countries agreed to take action to to limit long-term warming to 1.5-2°C, achieve net zero emissions and increase resilience to the emerging impacts of climate change. Countries submitted first post-2020 emissions reduction targets (NDCs) to either 2025 or 2030.1ST GLOBAL STOCKTAKEParis established a system whereby every five years countries collectively take stock on the world’s progress towards achieving the objectives of the Agreement.2ND GLOBAL STOCKTAKE3RD GLOBAL STOCKTAKE4TH GLOBAL STOCKTAKEPARIS AGREEMENT ENTERS INTO FORCEOn 4 November, the Paris Agreement will enter force within a year of being adopted.

Key elements of the Paris Agreement    Chinese government outlines sectors which will be covered by its national emissions trading scheme set to start in 2017, sectors such as electricity, steel and other major manufacturers, oil and gas production and aviation.  The Washington DC appeals court rules against delaying the implementation of the US government's  Clean Power Plan.  Californian insurance commissioner calls for insurers to divest from coal.  US Supreme Court grants a stay of implementation for the US Clean Power Plan.  China’s National Energy Administration announces it will restrain the construction of new coal-burning power plants and withdraw some existing approvals and shut down over 1,000 coal mines in 2016.  On the back of industry pressure, Kazakhstan decides to suspend its emissions trading scheme until 2018.  The Canadian state of Ontario releases draft regulations to establish an emission trading scheme.  Russia says it will strengthen its 2030 target.  New Zealand announces it will phase out its 2-for-1 carbon permit subsidy from January 2017.  Canada's Ontario passes legislation establishing its emissions trading scheme.  China brings manufacturer-owned power plants into its planned national ETS.  India announces plans to close coal plants aged 25 years old and over, saying they will be replaced by supercritical coal stations.  The US expands methane-reducing regulations for gas extraction to the oil industry.  Marrakech  climate  negotiations.  China and US announces that both countries will seek to ratify the Paris Agreement this year.  UK announces it will commit to achieving net zero emissions and enshrine the pledge into law.  US and Canada agree to cooperative action for taking steps to implement the Paris Agreement.  China releases its 13th five-year plan and sets a target to cut the carbon intensity of its economy to 18 per cent below current levels by 2020.  Canada agree to introduce nationwide carbon pricing mechanism/s.  Dutch National Bank calls for transition to carbon-neutral economy.  Canada, the US and Mexico jointly commit to achieve 50 per cent clean energy by 2025.  South Africa publishes draft regulations on the country’s proposed carbon tax.  The Norwegian Parliament commits to net zero emissions by 2030.  India and US commit to ratify the Paris Agreement and cooperate on climate change.  India cancels plans for coal stations totalling 16GW of capacity.  South Korea considers closing coal stations over 40 years old, to improve air quality.  SEC seeks comment on whether greenhouse gas emissions should be included in mining sector disclosure requirements.  France announces intention to tax coal-fired power generation.  China announces that a formal ban on new coal-fired power stations will be part of the 13th Five Year Plan’s energy policy.  South Korea announces plans to close 10 coal stations by 2025 and an increase in its renewable energy target to 7 per cent by 2020.  Countries agree to establish a global emissions trading scheme for international aviation.  190+ governments, reach agreement to phase down HFCs  Canada announces it will impose mandatory carbon pricing on provinces that do not adopt a carbon price themselves.  China announces it will stop the construction of coal-fired power plants in 15 regions.  BHP updates climate portfolio analysis after less than  12 months to allow for faster growth in EVs and solar.  Mexico announces it will develop a pilot emissions trading scheme with a view to implementing it nationally in 2018.  Investor groups representing  $13 trillion press  for G20 nations to ratify Paris agreement.  Ontario and Quebec, Canada, strike a deal with Mexico to cooperate on carbon trading.  California commits to cutting emissions to at least 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030.  Germany publishes its plan on how the country will meet its goal of cutting emissions by 80-95 per cent by mid-century.  SEC is reportedly to be probing Exxon's reporting of reserves and climate-risks.  Mark Carney's speech on climate change: Paris ""greatly increases transition risks as well as opportunities"".  BlackRock publishes ""landmark"" paper saying investors should adapt to climate change risks and outlining ways of doing so.  177 countries sign Paris Agreement,  12 countries deposit instruments of ratification and a further 22 countries commit to ratifying the Agreement in 2016.  China suspends coal station approvals across areas with surplus power capacity - 28 of its 31 mainland provinces.  • Sorting out the rulebook  The Paris Agreement set the framework for global action towards achieving net zero emissions but did not decide the detailed rulebook for global cooperation (see Box 3).  In Paris, the expectation was that it would take until around 2018 for this to be completed. The very rapid entry into force of the agreement has created a sense of urgency to define the rules, and also created a number of procedural challenges. This is because the first formal meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement will take place after the treaty becomes international law, and many of the detailed rules for the implementation of the agreement are yet to be agreed as countries have not had time to finalise them. This is the backdrop to Marrakech.  The situation is more complicated by the fact that, formally, only those countries that have ratified the agreement can be involved in decision making. To date, 86 of the 197 parties to the convention will have ratified. The government has stated that ratifying the agreement is in our national interest and will be in a position to do so by the end of the year.  Key issues at Marrakech  As a result, the initial days of Marrakech are likely to focus on two core issues:  1 Establishing a formal process to allow negotiations on the rulebook to continue so they can be agreed upon at a future meeting in, say, 2018. This could be done, for example, by extending for first formal meeting of the Paris Agreement beyond Marrakech and establishing a deadline to conclude negotiations in 2018.  2 Establishing an inclusive process that will allow countries who have not yet ratified the agreement to participate in decision making. Excluding, the 110 countries who have, in many cases for good reasons, not yet finalised their domestic legal processes of ratification would be very damaging to the development of the agreement and future participation by these countries.  In addition to the detailed negotiations of rules, Marrakesh will also host a Ministerial forum which will celebrate entry into force of the agreement. It will also discuss progress on scaling up financial and other support for poor nations, and the progress being made on addressing Loss and Damage.• Box 3: Defining the Paris Agreement rulebook  Marrakech is a crucial opportunity for governments to step up the pace of negotiations to define the elements of the detailed rulebook for global cooperation. Below are examples of the detailed rules that were to be drafted before the first meeting of the Paris Agreement. Assuming the procedural issues outlined above are resolved, these will be some of the key issues that countries will negotiate in Marrakech:  + Clarity on emissions targets: Before Paris, countries broadly outlined what nations should report to the international community when they submit their emissions reductions targets. For example, countries are expected to outline how their target is consistent with the objectives of international agreements (i.e. limiting warming to the less than 2°C). When countries advanced their post-2020 emissions targets many nations did this but others, like Australia, did not. In Paris, it was agreed that more detailed rules would be developed on what countries should and should not report when they advance emissions targets.  + Transparency of national actions, emissions and progress toward achieving targets: The Paris Agreement builds on the current framework which sees countries report on their emissions and actions to meet targets every two years. Paris established a single framework that applies to all nations, and the detailed rules for transparency were to be developed by the first meeting of the agreement.  + Rules for scaling up and ensuring there is transparency around financial and other support to developing countries for adaptation and net zero emissions development: Scaling up financial and other support (e.g. capacity building, technology transfer) to poor nations so they can adapt to emerging climate change impacts, and align with a net zero emissions pathway, are central elements of the Paris Agreement. Rules and procedures for these issues are to be developed.  + Global stocktakes: Paris established a system whereby every five years countries collectively take stock of the world’s progress towards achieving the objectives of the Agreement. By the first meeting of the Paris Agreement, sources of scientific inputs, how to measure the overall effectiveness of national emissions targets and other technical rules and procedures were to be drafted.  + International emissions trading: The use of carbon pricing and markets continues to grow at a national level. In Paris, it was agreed that a mechanism would be developed to allow nations to meet their targets through international emissions trading. For example, if one country is overachieving its target it could trade excess credits to another country to help it meet its target. Again, by the first meeting of the Paris Agreement detailed rules for this new global market mechanism were to have been drafted.  • In some respects, given the nature of the current political debate on climate and energy policy in Australia, one could be forgiven for thinking the Paris Agreement does not exist. The government has stated that the Agreement is in Australia’s national interest,16 but the long-term implications of the Agreement have yet to sink into mainstream political and media discourse, and domestic policy making.  For example, the government has signed and is expected to soon ratify the treaty which aims to accelerate action towards net zero emissions. However, discussions around energy and climate policy have a tendency, at best, to only focus on what is needed to achieve the government’s current, inadequate 2030 target.Implementing the Paris Agreement  Australia is yet to ratify the Agreement. The government is observing the normal process for excepting international treaties through the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. At the outset of that process Ministers Bishop and Frydenberg stated that the Agreement is in Australia’s national interest. Australia should be in position to ratify the Agreement during the Marrakech meeting as our domestic process should have been completed.  In line with the decisions made in Paris, the government must reconsider and resubmit its 2030 target by 2019-2020 at the latest. It is worth noting in this context that the ALP have committed to at least a 45 percent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030. Regardless of whether at this time it puts forward a more credible 2030 target consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, in 2024 it will need to put forward a stronger post-2030 target. And every five years after this Australia will need to advance an even stronger target until we achieve net zero emissions.  Decisions in Paris also ask governments to submit 2050 targets that are in line with the objectives of the agreements by 2020. The Abbott government committed internationally to consider its post-2030 emissions pathway in its 2017 policy review.18 Other countries, including the US, are developing 2050 plans to help guide long-term planning and decision making by investors and the community (Box 4).  Implications for Australia  Box 4: Defining long-term  emissions pathways  In 2015, the Abbott government committed internationally to “consider a potential long-term emissions reduction goal for Australia, beyond 2030”. In addition, under the decisions made in Paris, countries have been invited to define long-term emissions strategies to 2050 that take into account the objectives of the agreement (limiting warming to 1.5-2°C and net zero emissions). Many countries already have long-term targets, and countries like the US, Canada and Mexico have committed to do so by the end of this year.  Long-term targets matter because:  1 Private sector investment signals: A credible international commitment to reduce emissions to a certain level over the long-term provides an important signal for long-term investment decisions. This in turn enhances the ability of companies and investors to develop strategies that deal with the risks and opportunities associated with the transition to net zero emissions. This is particularly the case for infrastructure with long lifespans, which risk becoming stranded if the need to achieve net zero emissions is not considered in investment decisions.  2 Signals to market regulators: A long-term signal would aid the efficient functioning of public sector organisations with governance responsibilities across Australia’s electricity, financial and other markets and systems. It helps ensure that they are taking into account long-term objectives as they exercise any oversight, planning or regulatory responsibilities.  3 International diplomacy: Australia has made an international commitment to examine its post-2030 emissions pathway as part of the 2017 review. Backsliding on this commitment would harm Australia’s interests in areas within the negotiations it is seeking to advance. Australia cannot avoid international pressure to define a 2050 emissions pathway. Other countries will update and define their 2050 targets over the next few years and if Australia joins these countries it will also increase pressure on major emerging economies, such as China and India, to define their long-term  By just focusing on the short-term, policy makers and  the media risk building major community and economic  transition risks into the outcomes of decision making.  For example, the electricity sector is Australia’s largest  source of emissions and is key to reducing emissions  in other sectors (e.g. electric vehicles and buildings  based on clean electricity). It is also undergoing a  major transformation driven by domestic and global  technology trends. Limited action to accelerate and  manage the transformation to a decarbonised electricity  sector over the short-term means the sector would need  to undergo very rapid and disruptive changes later on to  ensure Australia acts in line the objectives of the  Paris Agreement.  Figure 2, illustrates this based on modelling for The  Climate Institute19 and, separately, for the Climate  Change Authority.20 Under all scenarios that are  consistent with limiting global warming to less than 2°C,  Australia’s existing coal fired generators need to be  replaced with clean energy over the next 15-20 years.  The pathway to achieve this matters. Delaying credible  action to manage this transition would mean that nearly  all of the existing generation fleet would need to be  replaced in five years to be consist with the objectives  of the Paris Agreement. This would be devastating to  local communities and risk major shocks to electricity  markets and prices.  FIGURE 2  Coal generation capacity under The Climate Institute (TCI) and Climate Change Authority’s (CCA) commissioned modelling of the  electricity sector under less than 2°C scenarios. The current national target scenario is consistent with the electricity sector reducing  emissions by a similar amount as the national target. TCI – Clean in Coal out and CCA – Emissions intensity mimic the current policy  frameworks proposed by the TCI and CCA respectively. A broader range of other scenarios based on different policy frameworks and  other assumptions is shown for completeness.  2017: A chance for credible climate policies consistent with the Paris Agreement  The government’s promised 2017 review of climate policies and consideration of post-2030 emissions targets, represents the first chance for a credible national policy conversation in five years. It will be an important opportunity to integrate climate, energy and economic policy.  This review could deliver a suite of credible, bipartisan supported, long-term policies at the federal level. These can be fair and inclusive to communities impacted by the inevitable transition to clean energy, and can minimise unnecessary costs to business.  The Climate Institute’s National Agenda for Climate Action provides a comprehensive roadmap for achieving these outcomes across three inter-related policy dimensions:  1 setting a credible emissions pathway to net zero emissions  2 ensuring investor, business and community confidence in clean energy; and  3 integrating climate costs and opportunities into mainstream decision-making.  The Australian Climate Roundtable – which comprises the Australian Aluminium Council, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Energy Council, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Investor Group on Climate Change, The Climate Institute and WWF Australia – has also published climate policy principles which address the goals of climate policy and the characteristics of policies to meet the goals.25 The Australian Climate Roundtable has concluded that the most serious and immediate barrier to Australia’s successful transition is not the technical or economic challenges involved – substantial though they are – it is the absence of broad political agreement on a scalable approach to climate and energy policy.This can be achieved, but will require policymakers to put aside the politics and division of the last few decades and acknowledge we need to face the realities of a net zero emissions world.  Next steps  The immediate next steps for the government should be:  + Ratification of the Paris Agreement in Marrakech.  + Deliver on its promise to release 2030 emissions projections this year, and do so well before Christmas.  + Ensure the 2017 review, and related COAG energy processes, will consider credible policy to help grow a net zero emissions economy before 2050. This will need to include inclusive social and economic strategies to steadily replace coal fired power stations over the next 15 years.  Box 5: Australia in the spotlight  Australia will answer direct questions from countries on its progress to reduce emissions on the 12th of November at Marrakech. This “Multilateral Assessment” process was established to review 2020 emissions reductions targets.This process aims to transparently compare the efforts of developed countries, and track the impact of the actions they are taking. This process is the precursor to what will apply to all countries under the Paris Agreement after 2020. While possibly uncomfortable for nations when put under the spotlight, this process can help ensure that countries meet their commitments and avoid international criticism.  As part of this process other countries including the US, China and Brazil have already raised questions around the transparency of Australia’s reporting on the impact of policy decisions on Australia’s emissions projections, and have asked when Australia’s 2030 projections will be released.22 Additionally, the expert review of the report Australia provided to the international community on progress towards its targets raised similar questions. The review stated that in many instances the government has not been transparent with the international community on the impact of its domestic policies.For over two decades, one of Australia’s priorities for the international framework has been to ensure it promotes transparency and accountability on all countries to do what they say they will. Australia will be better placed to encourage greater transparency from other countries if it is being transparent on its own emissions and projections. For example, the Australian government should deliver on its promise to the international community to release the latest 2030 emissions projections in 2016. This should not be done on Christmas Eve as the government has done in the past for other emissions reports."
EDF-AR-2014.txt,"THE WAY FORWARD 2014 ANNUAL REPORT A   Environmental Defense Fund's mission is to preserve the natural systems on which all life depends. Guided by science and economics, we find practical and lasting solutions to the most serious environmental problems. ©2014 Environmental Defense Fund, New York, NY 100% post-consumer recycled paper Please share this report with others and invite them to join you in supporting our work.   LOOKING BACK...LOOKING FORWARD  At Environmental Defense Fund, we recognize that our work requires perseverance and long-term commitment. The important advances won for the environment in 2014 resulted from the sustained efforts of EDF and others over many years--and we will need to remain vigilant to defend and build upon these gains in the years ahead. Since the 1990s, EDF has relied on a series of five-year strategic plans to map out efforts on the scale needed to protect climate, oceans, ecosystems and health. This is the final year of one such plan and the gateway to the next. Our vision for 2015­2019 is captured in Blueprint 2020, a document you can find at edf.org/ blueprint2020. Taking stock, we are pleased to report that we are on track to attain many of the goals established in our previous plan in 2009, though not always in the way we had expected. It's not so easy to see five years down the road. CLIMATE In our 2009 plan, we aimed to help put the U.S. on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% by 2020 (compared to 2005). Today the country is on this path--but not by means of the legislation EDF had advocated.  That bill passed the House in 2009 but stalled out in the Senate. We then looked for other ways to achieve the same goal. Our 2020 target for U.S. emissions is still within reach, partly due to low natural gas prices but also thanks to advances including vehicle mileage standards, state-level actions and EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan--solutions that EDF and our allies helped move forward. We still need bigger cuts, so EDF has  launched a clean energy program that is dedicated to clearing away the regulatory and market obstacles that slow the transition to renewable energy. On the global climate front, we have faced a persistent lack of progress toward an international agreement, one of our 2009 aims. Dramatic advances in a few large-emitting countries can help break the logjam. Already we are heartened by some bright spots, including China's launch of seven pilot carbon trading programs to address climate pollution and Brazil's success in reducing its Amazon deforestation rate by 70% in the past decade. Building on this progress, Blueprint 2020 lays out a series of actions in several key countries that can reverse the rise of global greenhouse gas emissions within five years--which would be a remarkable reversal of the two-century-long trend of increasing emissions. OCEANS In an effort to reduce the problem of overfishing, our 2009 plan aimed to bring 50% of U.S. federal fisheries into a powerful management program called catch shares by the end of 2014. We have exceeded that goal, having already reached the 65% mark. Many fish populations are rebounding-- Gulf of Mexico red snapper, one of our earliest catch share successes, has tripled in abundance. Far fewer fish are being wasted than under the old rules--80% less in the Pacific groundfish fishery--and fishermen are better off.  No wonder EDF was invited to work with fishermen and nonprofits in eight other countries to help adapt these methods to different cultures, laws and fishery conditions. This puts us well ahead of our 2009 goal to help bring catch shares to three more countries by 2014. Buoyed by this success, we have set a goal in Blueprint 2020 to help bring sustainable fishing to one-third of the world's catch by 2020. ECOSYSTEMS We have achieved many local successes on working lands since 2009. For example, we engaged farmers across the Midwest in cutting excess fertilizer that pollutes air and water, and we pioneered an exchange program where ranchers are paid to protect more wildlife habitat than is lost to development on lands nearby. We were frustrated, however, by the difficulty of scaling up these local approaches to the level needed. So in Blueprint 2020, we will expand our work with corporate partners and economic incentives to accelerate these solutions. For example, companies like Campbell's Soup and General Mills will work with their suppliers to reduce excess use of fertilizer.   The 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster put at risk more than three decades of efforts to restore coastal wetlands in Louisiana. So we worked with our sister organization, EDF Action (see p.7) to help Congress pass a law directing 80% of BP's civil penalties to the Gulf Coast. The first payments of billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties are changing the landscape of restoration as we begin to work at the scale needed to save these wetlands. HEALTH Sulfur dioxide pollution from power plants has been cut 68% from 2005 levels, approaching the goal we set in 2009, while emissions of nitrogen oxides were halved and mercury was reduced substantially, as was air pollution from ships. Although we have not yet reached our goal to reform the obsolete Toxic Substances Control Act, the nation's main chemicals law, we made more progress in Congress and with retail partners than ever before, so this reform remains a goal in Blueprint 2020. Since 2010, EDF has built a major effort focused on securing strong regulations to protect air, water and public health from impacts of oil and gas development and to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the natural  gas supply chain (see p.16). In Blueprint 2020, we are continuing to seek strong rules, enforcement and penalties for noncompliance. The vital progress of the past five years has come about not through the work of EDF alone but through many groups' combined and independent efforts. This Fred Krupp, President  will be even more true in the future. As we say in Blueprint 2020, no single entity can do all that is needed to address today's urgent environmental problems. But by working in partnership with many others, we can make a difference. Thank you for your support, which makes our work possible. Carl Ferenbach, Chairman  ""One thing I've always liked about the Environmental Defense Fund is its hardheaded approach. Founded by scientists, it believes in data, not hysteria. It promotes market incentives to change behavior and isn't afraid to work with industry. Utterly nonpartisan, it is oriented toward practical policy solutions."" Joe Nocera New York Times columnist  Finding the ways that work  A DIFFERENT KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION  What if Ph.D. scientists, economists, MBAs and policy experts could work together to solve environmental problems? It's happening every day at Environmental Defense Fund. The diverse skills that we apply to each environmental challenge create opportunities for alliances that produce lasting change.  ""We are using networked sensors and other emerging technologies to ground the policy debate with strong data."" Dr. Steven Hamburg Chief scientist ""Environments are destroyed when markets fail to protect them. EDF and our allies help design markets that protect rather than destroy."" Dr. Frank Convery Chief economist ""Accepting no funding from our corporate partners frees us to set more aggressive goals and influence entire industries."" Tom Murray VP Corporate Partnerships    REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE  L asting environmental solutions result from having everyone pitch in, regardless of their political views. ""That's why we engage in policy advocacy that pushes both political parties to be better on our issues,"" says Elizabeth Thompson, president of EDF Action, Environmental Defense Fund's political advocacy partner. ""Our strategy is even more essential now that the White House and Congress are controlled by different parties."" EDF Action is free to do things that EDF cannot, including unlimited lobbying of Congress. It does this by raising dollars that are not tax deductible. EDF Action prevailed in 2014 when the House voted 223­ 185 to defeat an appropriations rider that would have banned expansion of catch shares, the management approach that has helped POLITICS  fish stocks recover. Three years ago, a similar rider passed in the House by 100 votes. The turnabout was made possible by a strategy that included cultivating GOP champions and bringing fishermen to Washington to make their case.  Elizabeth Thompson  ""Advancing smart policies requires smart politics. EDF's Strategic Partners help widen support on both sides of the aisle."" Elizabeth Thompson President, EDF Action  This was just one of EDF Action's 2014 victories. For Climate, it helped defeat legislative efforts to undermine EPA's Clean Power Plan (see p.10), and it defended Republicans in Kansas who were protecting state renewable energy standards. For Health, EDF Action helped advance reform of federal chemicals policy. For Ecosystems, it secured funding for wetlands protection. Our Strategic Partners, a network of influential supporters, help deliver EDF's message. Says Thompson: ""Lawmakers listen to their supporters, and many in both parties want action on the environment. We amplify their voices.""  We can cut carbon and chart a clean energy future  ""The work EDF has done in combining moral commitment, science and economics has been critical. Can you imagine what it would look like if preserving the Earth and handing it to our children were the moral project of our time?"" Dr. Jim Yong Kim World Bank President, addressing EDF Board of Trustees, May 2013  TAKING ON THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTERS  Historians may look back to June 2, 2014, as the day the United States finally started getting serious about global climate change. That morning the Environmental Protection Agency, in an action long advocated by EDF, proposed the Clean Power Plan, the first-ever national standards to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants. Fossil fuel plants cause about a third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, more than any other source. ""These rules are absolutely necessary,"" says EDF general counsel Vickie Patton. ""They'll help protect our children from smog, curb respiratory problems and cut the pollution that is threatening our  communities with extreme weather."" As expected, major coal interests and their supporters in Congress have vowed to scuttle the plan. Anticipating the barrage, EDF joined with allies like the American Lung Association to launch a campaign --in the courts, on Capitol Hill and with the public--to ensure the final rules are strong. EDF Action, our political lobbying partner, has already been instrumental in beating back legislation that would have defunded EPA. But future attacks are expected. EPA's authority to act was established in a series of court cases in which EDF played a role, including at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007 that the Clean  Air Act applies to greenhouse gas emissions. Since then, EDF has worked with, and sometimes sued, EPA to secure carbon pollution protections. The Clean Power Plan would cut emissions from the power sector by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030. It gives states flexibility in meeting their targets, whether by deploying renewable energy, ramping up energy efficiency or creating regional carbon markets to achieve reductions at the lowest cost. EPA estimates that for every $1 invested in complying with the plan, Americans will gain $7 in health benefits. continued on page ""We'll need to be in the trenches to make sure the final power plant rule is strong and defended in court."" Vickie Patton EDF general counsel  In 2013, global carbon 2.3% emissions jumped to record levels.  Throughout the process, EDF and allies have been pushing for deep reductions. We are showing how our clean energy work in key states already achieved steep cuts. Colorado, for example, passed bipartisan legislation, backed by EDF, that will improve air quality while ensuring a reliable supply of electricity. Going forward, we'll work with states to help implement the final rules. ""The new plan will drive innovation, allowing America to lead in clean technologies,"" says EDF attorney Megan Ceronsky. ""And it will make our air safer to breathe.""  Moms Clean Air Force has held ""mama summits"" across the nation to build support for the Clean Power Plan. The EDF-backed group, now more than 365,000 strong, has shown that an important constituency feels strongly about children's health--and will hold elected officials accountable.  PARTNERS IN CONTROLLING METHANE Mark Heising and Liz Simons / EDF donors  Stewardship of the planet has always resonated with Mark Heising and Liz Simons, and they found that their views align with EDF's approach of using science and economics and engaging corporations. ""To move the needle on climate today, we need to reduce short-term forcers like methane, in addition to carbon dioxide,"" says Heising, an EDF trustee who co-chairs  our climate committee. ""We learned EDF was looking at the methane problem, and we got in early."" Both were impressed by peer-reviewed studies that EDF launched with dozens of university researchers to analyze methane leaks. As Simons, president of their family foundation and a funder of early childhood initiatives, says: ""We want a safe, habitable planet for our children and all the world's children.""  ""EDF has the breadth and depth to come up with integrated, scalable solutions to complex problems."" Mark Heising  CALIFORNIA: A CLIMATE LAUNCH PAD  W hen California's Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) was signed into law in 2006, naysayers said it would hurt the economy. But the legislation, which EDF and NRDC co-sponsored, has helped California cut greenhouse gas emissions even as the state's economy has grown. AB 32 sets an economy-wide cap on emissions, requiring a reduction to 1990 levels by 2020. Its centerpiece is a carbon market targeting 350 of California's largest polluters. The declining cap creates a market for innovations. California has also set rigorous standards for cleaner cars, renewable energy and low-carbon fuels, spurring changes in the way automakers design cars, utilities generate electricity and refineries make fuel. Among the innovations: EDF partnered with rice growers in the Sacramento Valley to develop a first-of-its-kind project to reward farmers in the carbon market when they reduce methane emissions. A flourishing clean-tech economy w C lean-tech jobs have grown ten times faster than jobs in other sectors w $21 billion in clean-tech venture capital has been invested since 2006, more than in all other states combined  California's economy-wide cap on climate pollution will improve conditions in disadvantaged communities like Wilmington, an industrialized area in Los Angeles.  w 15% of California's electricity comes from renewable energy, compared to 5% nationwide A boom in innovation w 15% of new cars sold must be zero- or near-zero emission vehicles by 2025 w California represents 40% of all U.S. plug-in electric vehicle sales w In 2013, as much rooftop solar was installed as in the previous 30 years  Helping people reduce their footprint w 9% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per person since 2006 w 45% less electricity use per capita than the national average Health benefits for all By 2025: w $8.3 billion cumulative savings in health costs statewide w 900 fewer premature deaths annually  EDF'S DETECTIVES TARGET ENERGY WASTE  EDF Climate Corps pairs MBA and other graduate students--the green business leaders of tomorrow--with businesses, cities and universities, where they hunt for energy savings. In 2014, they found $130 million in potential savings--equal to avoiding the annual  climate pollution of 115,000 cars-- and some were featured on Showtime's award-winning series Years of Living Dangerously. In Chicago, they worked in 25 buildings to help the city address its goal of cutting energy use in large commercial buildings by 20%.  This year, EDF Climate Corps expanded to China, where six fellows found energy savings at companies that included Apple, McDonald's and Cummins.  ""Most people get an MBA to get into banking. I went the other way--I left banking and got an MBA to promote sustainability."" Gina Melekh, 2014 EDF Climate Corps fellow  A VOICE FOR A NEW GENERATION  One key to climate progress is to engage growing constituencies, including young people, who care deeply about climate but often don't vote. In Colorado, we enlisted climate-action supporters, targeting Millennials (roughly 18 to 33 years of age), asking them to pledge to vote on climate issues. We secured over 125,000 pledges. Many previously voted only in presidential elections. ""I haven't been involved in politics before,"" says Bianca Buium, a student at the University of Colorado in Boulder, ""but we can't just ignore this problem or the politicians will, too."" The campaign, called Defend Our Future, deployed a mix of digital and social media strategies, along with traditional grassroots organizing. Our goal is to expand it to a larger, national effort in future election cycles. ""Millennials are among those who must live with the most serious consequences of climate change,"" says Dr. Alicia Kolar Prevost, who is running our nonpartisan initiative. We're also focusing on Latino audiences. National polling data shows that Latino voters overwhelmingly support action to fight climate change.  Hundreds of thousands, including EDF members, joined the People's Climate March in New York.   THE NEW WORLD OF CLEAN ELECTRICITY  Today's smartphones are light years ahead of the computers that took us to the moon in 1969--yet our electric power system is on a par with antiquated rotary phones. A big challenge is the U.S. energy system's built-in disincentives to conserve: utilities profit by selling more electricity and building power plants. A tangle of rules impedes innovation. EDF's clean energy program envisions a low-carbon world where homes generate and sell renewable energy and utilities profit by saving customers energy and money. We're putting incentives in place to make this happen. EDF works in nine states that make up half the U.S. electricity market. In New York, we're helping Governor Andrew Cuomo make the Empire State a model for a resilient energy system. In California, Governor Jerry Brown signed into law an EDF-sponsored bill for demand response, which gives people a financial reward for using less power during times of peak demand. In Texas, we're part of Pecan Street, a living lab for clean energy solutions. As utilities prepare to invest $2 trillion to replace aging infrastructure in the next two decades, EDF is ensuring the money goes to a clean energy future.  EDF co-founded Pecan Street Inc., in Austin, TX. Participating homeowners save money, and their homes use 38% less electricity on average for cooling, per square foot, than conventional houses.  WHY METHANE MATTERS  Production  Processing   Natural gas is mostly methane, a short-lived but powerful pollutant that accounts for one quarter of the global warming we now experience. LOOK INSIDE to see how EDF is working to reduce the methane that is leaked and vented along the natural gas supply chain--and helping to protect communities from unacceptable impacts to air, water and health.  PROGRESS IN COLORADO Few were talking about the climate impact of methane in 2012 when EDF chief scientist Dr. Steven Hamburg and scientist Dr. Ramon Alvarez co-authored a paper on the subject. We then launched our largest-ever science effort to understand how much methane is emitted along the natural gas supply chain. We've learned there is a huge opportunity to reduce emissions of methane--a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 during its first 20 years in the atmosphere--and slow the rate of climate change in our lifetimes. With allies like Conservation Colorado, we set our sights on a state where a drilling boom had stirred conflict between industry and communities. EDF president  Fred Krupp and our team began meeting with Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who asked EDF to join industry and other groups to craft a solution. Today, the state has the nation's strongest air pollution rules for oil and gas operations and the first direct regulation of methane. How did this happen? Three of the state's biggest producers--Anadarko, Encana and Noble--saw that their social license to operate was at risk. They stepped up. The rules slash methane emissions by more than 30% and cut air pollution as much as getting all the cars and trucks off the road in Colorado. We're using the rules as a template for federal action and in other states where EDF is fighting to reduce air pollution.  OUR METHANE REDUCTION ST 1 GET THE FACTS EDF gathered the needed science to fill the data gaps with 16 peer-reviewed field studies involving nearly 100 partners from academia and industry. ""Fred Krupp represents an organization that is fact-based and willing to build alliances."" John Hickenlooper Colorado governor  OUR GOAL: REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS across the entire STRATEGY 2 ADVANCE NEXT-GENERATION TECHNOLOGY EDF has partnered with leading energy and tech companies to develop and apply cutting-edge technologies to detect and monitor methane emissions in real time.  3 WIN STATE RULES TO CONTROL METHANE AND AIR POLLUTION Our strategy is to secure strong regulations in states where oil and gas production is most active.  4 PUSH FOR STRONG FEDERAL REGULATIONS EDF is leading the fight for urgently needed federal standards that would use Colorado's tough, sensible rules as a model.

Karin Tuxen-Bettman Program manager for Google Earth Outreach   CHINA DEPLOYS EMISSIONS TRADING TO TACKLE CARBON  C hina burns roughly half the world's coal. This has helped lift the country out of poverty, but at a steep price in terms of air pollution and climate change. EDF is helping the country address those twin dangers by taking important steps toward cleaner energy. To drive prosperity while reining in emissions, China is harnessing the power of the marketplace. With EDF's involvement, the country has launched emissions trading programs in five cities and two provinces, home to 250 million people. EDF trained more than 1,000 government officials and others on key  elements of emissions trading, including verification. China now hopes to launch national emissions trading by 2016 and is aiming for a 17% reduction in carbon intensity from 2010 levels by 2015. The country is on track to meet that goal. Also in 2014: w China tightened penalties on polluters, a reform that EDF has advocated for more than a decade. The ceiling on penalties will be scrapped, officials will be held more accountable and citizens will have more power to sue. The reforms, which Reuters called ""the most sweeping revisions to the law in  25 years,"" are modeled on an EDF pilot enforcement project in Chongqing. w EDF and Shenzhen launched a research project aimed at reducing carbon pollution from the city's vehicles, which have soared from 200,000 to 2.7 million in ten years. The project will incorporate mobile sources into Shenzhen's existing carbon emissions trading program, which was created with help from EDF. The Shenzhen vehicle project was picked as a U.S.-China EcoPartnership by both governments, one of six such projects selected this year.   CUTTING EMISSIONS AROUND THE WORLD  Global warming affects everyone and demands an international response. EDF, seeking to reduce emissions and help lay the foundation for future carbon markets, helped launch several initiatives at the 2014 UN Climate Summit. Halt deforestation More than 35 national and state governments and 34 corporations pledged to cut deforestation in half by 2020--and end it completely by 2030. With other nonprofits, EDF was a key partner in the coalition that put together this landmark agreement. Deforestation today accounts for 15% of global carbon emissions. Promote carbon pricing We helped assemble a coalition of 73 countries and 1,000 companies and nonprofit groups calling for a price on carbon--an approach that EDF supports to cut climate pollution as efficiently and effectively as possible. Cut methane EDF, along with six major oil and gas companies and several governments-- including France, the UK and the United States--launched an international partnership to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas production.  Reduce pollution and poverty Elsewhere, EDF helped broker an important agreement between India's largest airline and Indian grassroots groups, making it possible for IndiGo passengers to help offset the carbon footprint of their flights. So far, the program has raised more than $2 million for low-carbon rural development projects, such as purchasing biogas cookstoves to replace highly polluting wood stoves.  (Top) With EDF's help, Brazil's Kayapo people orchestrated a government operation to stop logging and mining on their land, a territory the size of Pennsylvania. (Bottom) In India, climate-friendly agriculture is helping to alleviate poverty.  Thriving oceans, healthy fisheries, prosperous communities  ""EDF won my trust and cooperation. They understand that sustainability is not just about conserving fish. It's also about families who have been fishing for generations."" Geoff Bettencourt Fisherman, Half Moon Bay, CA  RESTORING THE OCEANS TO ABUNDANCE  On a blustery August day, 30 miles off Monterey, CA, Capt. Joe Pennisi hauls up a net and dumps 5,000 pounds of chilipepper rockfish onto the deck. As crew members sort the fish, a biologist records unwanted species and notes their weight--a scant 40 pounds, or less than 1% of the catch. ""This is a new day,"" says Pennisi, a fourth-generation fisher man. ""We're totally accountable."" Not long ago, trawl fishermen like Pennisi were blamed for this West Coast fishery's collapse. ""I'll never forget the day when I saw a carpet of dead fish as big as a football field,"" he says. ""The culprit was senseless regulations."" Back then, if a fisherman caught too many of an  overfished species, he was forced to dump the excess in the ocean. ""It made me sick,"" Pennisi says. He lost pride in his job and sold his boat. But then in 2011, regulators switched the fishery to a catch share model. This approach, which EDF helped develop, gives each boat a percentage of the overall catch. Observers are required on all boats, and if a fisherman catches more than his share, he can buy quota from others, still keeping the total catch within the scientifically determined limit. ""Unlike other management tools, catch shares reward fishermen for conservation,"" says Shems Jud, EDF's West  Coast fisheries director. ""As the fishery recovers, the value of each share grows."" Fishermen who once fiercely competed now share information to avoid overfished species. That was enough to get Pennisi back on the water. He partnered with EDF to design a light-trawl net that floats above the sea floor, allowing him to cut fuel costs and avoid sensitive habitat. Other fishermen also switched to more selective gear. The result: Pacific continued on page ""If we protect habitats and offer fishermen a financial stake in the recovery of fisheries, we can bring the oceans back to life and revive coastal communities around the world."" Amanda Leland VP Oceans  65% of fish landed by commercial fishermen in U.S. federal waters are now under catch share management. Capt. Joe Pennisi (center) and his crew. Pennisi is hopeful because he can make a living from the sea while fishing sustainably. ""This is a much better system,"" he says. ""We're fishing smarter, not harder."" groundfish stocks are rebuilding, revenue is up and the amount of discarded fish has dropped about 80%. In August, the Monterey Bay Aquarium upgraded the sustainability rating of 21 of these species of rockfish, sole and other groundfish in its seafood guide. ""Fifteen years ago they wrote the obituary for this fishery,"" says Brad Pettinger, president of the Oregon Trawl Commission. ""We're showing we can be good stewards if given the right incentives.""  STARTING SMALL, THINKING BIG William K. Bowes, Jr. / EDF donor  ""The world's health is important to me,"" says venture capitalist Bill Bowes, Jr., an EDF trustee who supports our oceans work because of EDF's ""rational and results-oriented approach."" A prime example of that approach is catch shares--EDF's science-based solution to overfishing. ""Fishermen can fish all year and get higher prices, and sure enough the fish population starts to  climb,"" says Bowes. ""Everyone is better off."" He praises EDF's strategy of starting small, showing that catch shares work, and then scaling up the idea to the majority of the U.S. catch. ""That's what you want--to set a tidal wave going."" He adds, ""What drew me to EDF was the motto, `Finding the ways that work.' That's a great message, because EDF really does that.""  ""EDF finds practical solutions and gets astonishing results.""   REFORMING RECREATIONAL FISHING In the Gulf of Mexico, the commercial catch share program for red snapper, which EDF helped design, has been a huge success. Since the program began in 2007, the red snapper population has rebounded. But recreational fishing, which accounts for half the catch, is not part of the program and is poorly managed, leading to overfishing and large discards of fish. EDF helped win a legal victory requiring improved management. We also helped launch a two-year pilot catch share program for headboats, or large charter boats, which could be a model for managing recreational fishing. The results are promising, with 20 boats signed up for 2015. Member boats are able to take customers fishing year-round under strict catch limits, while those not in the program were only able to fish nine days in 2014.  ""This has been one of our best years ever. We've stayed within our quota, made more money and have been totally sustainable."" Capt. Randy Boggs Pilot program participant Reel Surprise Charters, Orange Beach, AL  WHY WE ARE WORKING WITH RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN  REVIVING FISHERIES AROUND THE WORLD    Overfishing is a global problem, so international engagement is essential. EDF aims to provide practical, science-based advice to governments and partner with local fishermen to help make sustainable fishing the norm in countries that account for nearly two-thirds of the global catch. LOOK INSIDE to see how we're helping turn the tide.  PRESERVING A WAY OF LIFE IN MEXICO On the first day of Lent, under a full moon, traditional fishermen head out in the Gulf of California to fish for curvina, a salmon-sized fish native to the area. It's a decades-old ritual that sustains local communities. The fishery is as large as the U.S. red snapper fishery, but overfishing has caused a perennial glut in supply, crashing prices and putting the survival of the species at risk. Historically, fishermen would land thousands of tons of these fish in just a few days. EDF teamed up with regional organizations to create a catch share program for curvina. By bringing together fishermen, government officials and buyers, the community developed an agreement in which each skiff was granted a per-tide allocation. The result? Fishermen are earning 23% more per pound of fish, and the catch is distributed across the entire  season. Catch shares have also reduced the total catch by half, ensuring longterm health of the population. EDF has now been asked by the hake industry to protect their fishery as well.  SAVING SHARKS IN CUBA EDF is working with Cuban scientists and fishermen to conduct the first in-depth survey of sharks in Cuba's waters. The research will inform Cuba's national plan of action for sharks, part of EDF's role as a key advisor to Cuban officials on how to safeguard these majestic creatures. BIG PLAYERS, BIG OPPORTUNITIES Europe's fisheries are in the worst condition of any in the developed world--75% are overfished. But the tide is turning. In 2013, we advised key officials of the European Union as they rewrote its fisheries law, committing Europe to end overfishing. And in 2014, the EU passed legislation to fund policies that will lead to more fish in the water and support communities making the transition to sustainable fishing. We're also working with fishermen in Spain, Sweden and the UK to improve the economic and ecological performance of fisheries. ""EDF has a different approach,"" says Scottish fishing representative John Goodlad. ""They seek solutions that chime with fishermen.""  LOCAL ACTION: KEY TO GLOBAL RECOVERY Nearly half the fish people eat are caught in small-scale fisheries, many of which are unmanaged and in serious trouble. EDF is partnering with UC Santa Barbara and Rare, a global leader in community-led conservation, in a collaboration called Fish Forever. Together we are providing fishermen with practical solutions to reverse overfishing, and are engaged in the Philippines and Indonesia as well as Belize, Brazil and Mozambique.  ""The best way to revive oceans is to empower fishermen with rights, responsibilities and rewards."" Dr. Laura Rodriguez Oceans deputy director EDF de México   The case for a new conservation economy  ""There's no doubt in my mind we'll substantially reduce fertilizer as a pollutant in American agriculture and save farmers money. Our partnership with EDF gives us a platform to do that."" Matt Carstens Vice President, United Suppliers  FARMERS AND RETAILERS TAKE ON FERTILIZER POLLUTION  In the summer of 2014, half a million residents of Toledo, OH, woke up to find their tap water unfit to drink. The cause? Poisonous cyanobacteria created by excess farm fertilizer polluting Lake Erie and other waters. With lakes across the country registering a rise of algae blooms driven by fertilizer, the same crisis could easily unfold in other cities. Fertilizer not absorbed by crops also can form nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. EDF has partnered with farmers for years to cut fertilizer loss, advancing techniques to improve the rate and timing of fertilizer application and promoting natural filters such as wetlands to keep fertilizer out of  rivers. As a result, farms on half a million acres have cut fertilizer loss by an average of 25%--all while maintaining yields. Of course that's only a small fraction of U.S. farmland, so we set out to scale up this successful approach. The quickest way to do so is by harnessing the U.S. grain supply chain. EDF helped secure a commitment from Walmart to reduce 20 million metric tons of greenhouse gases from its supply chain by 2015. To help meet that goal, the company is requiring its suppliers to create fertilizer efficiency plans. Food companies including Campbell's Soup, General Mills and Smithfield asked EDF to help them implement such plans, and this year  15 major Walmart suppliers, representing 30% of all North American food and beverage sales, began to launch fertilizer efficiency programs. To help farmers change long-held practices, EDF has partnered with United Suppliers (USI), an agricultural supply company, to create a fertilizer program that the company will implement through its members, who advise farmers managing 45 million acres. ""When I heard there was going to be a meeting with EDF, I said, `This can't be good,'"" recalls USI vice president Matt Carstens. ""Instead, EDF reached out and said, `Let's work together.' It became clear we all wanted the same thing--to keep fertilizer out of lakes and rivers. So we dropped our weapons and went to work."" EDF's focus is on corn, the biggest source of excess fertilizer. The goal is to improve fertilizer efficiency on 50% of corn acres by 2020. ""EDF put it all together,"" says Carstens. ""They worked on every aspect of the project, from developing the tools to education to accountability.""  ""Efficient fertilizer practices make great business sense. Growers are better off. And so is the environment."" Bill Couser, Iowa farmer and EDF partner  A LEGACY OF COOPERATION Dr. Susan Harris / EDF donor  Consultant and author Susan Harris believes people can change the world for the better--and trusts EDF to help lead the way. ""We make progress by engaging all players, not by excluding stakeholders with whom we might disagree,"" she says, citing EDF's work with farmers and agricultural businesses to cut fertilizer runoff. ""EDF is ahead of the curve in enlisting business to help  solve problems."" Harris's commitment to sustainability runs deep; she participated in the first Earth Day in 1970. ""The more I grasped the complexity of systems,"" she says, ""the more I appreciated EDF's holistic approach."" As an Osprey Legacy donor, Harris has made a gift to EDF in her will. ""I'm an optimist--and EDF is about tackling real problems in ways that work now and into the future.""  ""EDF is brilliant at bringing everyone to the table and getting the best outcome for all.""  A RIVER RUNS FREE W ith water in the West chronically over-allocated, EDF is engaging stakeholders to adopt flexible water management. For almost half a century, the Colorado River has rarely run its full course to Mexico's Gulf of California. But in 2014, it did, thanks to a deal EDF helped broker. A ""pulse flow"" of water, designed to mimic spring floods, was released into the dry riverbed. It's now providing scientists with clues on how to revitalize the delta. Smaller releases are planned for the next two years. The water came back because the United States and Mexico came together to share water, benefiting farmers as well as communities and wildlife. Delta inhabitants celebrated the return of the river with brass bands. ""We're relishing this moment. Our partnership with Mexico is a model for binational cooperation on sharing rivers and adapting to climate change."" Michael Connor U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Interior  The Colorado River pulse flow coincided with the spring migration of the Western tanager and other birds.  HELPING RARE WILDLIFE SURVIVE IN OIL AND GAS COUNTRY  Despite decades of effort, existing tools to protect America's rarest animals are not saving habitat fast enough to restore healthy populations. As many as 91 species of birds-- including the whooping crane--are threatened with extinction. The key to recovery for many of these species lies with America's private farm, ranch and forest landowners who manage twothirds of our nation's land. EDF has created powerful incentives for these landowners to embrace conservation  without onerous regulations. With EDF habitat exchanges, landowners are paid to maintain and improve habitat. The payments come from energy companies required to mitigate the damage they cause to lesser-quality habitat. Nowhere  is the urgency to save species greater than in the 16 Western states where two iconic rangeland birds, the greater sage-grouse and lesser prairie-chicken, nest in sagebrush and grasslands. The birds' shrinking habitat is home to the  ""Ranchers now want to raise birds as well as cows. We need to keep our youth on the land."" Terry Fankhauser Vice President, Colorado Cattlemen's Association   region's largest economic engines-- ranching and energy development. In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the prairie-chicken as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Now the agency faces a 2015 deadline to decide if the sage-grouse is to be similarly protected. Federal listing could severely crimp energy production and ranching across many states and trigger prolonged court battles with an uncertain outcome for the bird. EDF is working to recover the prairie-chicken by establishing a habitat exchange in the Great Plains. Similar efforts are under way for the sage-grouse in Colorado and Wyoming. We'll then expand our model to other states. Scientists will measure and verify the conservation actions taken, so we can ensure wildlife receives benefits in excess of impact. A company that degrades habitat will need to buy enough habitat credits to more than compensate for the harm it causes. ""This is the first systemic approach to conservation,"" says EDF scientist Ted Toombs, who's helping write the operations manual for the exchanges. ""We realized piecemeal conservation wasn't saving species."" The approach  Once numbering in the millions, the lesser prairie-chicken, known for its colorful courtship display, has declined more than 90% and survives on mere remnants of its historic range.  builds on EDF's successful program in the Texas Hill Country that aided the endangered golden-cheeked warbler in its Texas breeding grounds. Ranchers were paid by the Fort Hood Army base, and a rare bird became a valuable asset to nurture, like any other crop. ""By far the best feature of a habitat exchange is its collaborative nature,"" says Colorado rancher T. Wright Dickinson. ""We all realize the status quo wasn't working. EDF came along at the right time. They put an end to the conflict industry that had accomplished little actual conservation.""  Working with our partners to get toxic chemicals out of consumer products  ""It is far wiser and less expensive to prevent exposure to unsafe chemicals and air pollution than to have to treat the serious health problems that they can cause."" Dr. Lynn Goldman EDF Trustee; Dean, Milken Institute School of Public Health, The George Washington University  GUIDING WALMART TOWARD SAFER PRODUCTS  W ith the need for chemical safety reform growing increasingly urgent, EDF turned to the world's largest retailer to help place safer products on America's shelves. In 2014, Walmart rolled out a policy developed with EDF the previous year to phase out potentially harmful ingredients from tens of thousands of products-- shampoos, body lotions, cosmetics and more--in its U.S. stores, which serve 140 million customers weekly. Most chemicals have never been tested for possible health impacts, even as research shows that babies in the womb typically carry dozens of toxic chemicals  and pollutants in their bodies. No wonder consumers are demanding change. Walmart used a software program we helped develop to assess chemicals in formulated products. The results were disturbing: nearly 40% of Walmart's assessed products contained chemicals that may pose health risks. Walmart asked EDF to help create a policy for its suppliers to replace these chemicals. With chemists and toxicologists, we prioritized chemicals according to their hazard, prevalence in products and potential for human exposure. Walmart then targeted a short list of chemicals of concern to remove from its products.  Under the policy, Walmart suppliers must show that newly added chemicals are safer than those they replace. Suppliers also must disclose all ingredients in their products by 2015. ""Everybody must be transparent by January 1,"" says Michelle Harvey, EDF's supply chain director. ""If not, they're threatening a very important business relationship."" With Walmart's unparalleled purchasing power, its policy will inevitably drive change throughout the $250 billion global personal care and household products industry. We're already seeing ripple effects: Target and CVS have announced their own chemicals programs this year. ""These actions show that what's good for people and the environment is also good for business,"" says EDF VP of corporate partnerships Tom Murray. Note: EDF accepts no funding from Walmart or any other corporate partners, or from their corporate foundations. We do accept funding from private foundations and from individuals.  A MORAL IMPERATIVE Angela and David Filo / EDF donors  For Angela Filo, a photographer and mother of two young daughters, chemical safety is a moral imperative: ""We don't know what we're exposing our children and families to."" Filo and her husband David, co-founder of Yahoo, support EDF's efforts to remove chemicals of concern from consumer products and replace them with safer substitutes.  ""We look to EDF to be a watchdog for children and families and to grow awareness of this critical but overlooked issue,"" she says. The Filos, who support EDF through their Yellow Chair Foundation, also admire the strategy of working with key corporations to change their chemicals policies. ""We found in EDF a trusted partner who looks after the broader health of the community.""  ""EDF brings to bear the science, integrity and legal expertise that drive progress through corporate channels."" Angela Filo  BECAUSE VOLUNTARY ACTION WILL NOT BE ENOUGH, A PUSH FOR STRONG REGULATION  T he Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) makes it so difficult to prove harm from a chemical that, since TSCA was passed in 1976, companies have only had to test about 3% of the 85,000 chemicals available for commercial use. In 2014, the need to reform this federal law was vividly demonstrated when a chemical spill near Charleston, WV, left 300,000 people without drinking water. Public officials could find virtually no hazard data on the spilled chemical, despite the fact that the coal industry has used it for years. EDF scientist Dr. Richard Denison linked the problem to outdated regulations and questioned the government's assurances of safety given to Charleston residents. In Washington, he advised legislators in making hundreds of improvements to proposed TSCA reform legislation. Meanwhile, EPA issued its first final risk assessments under TSCA in 28 years, finding that two commonplace chemicals pose unacceptably high risks to workers and the public. EDF is pushing the agency to institute safety measures for the chemicals.  Potentially dangerous chemicals that spilled from these storage tanks on the Elk River outside Charleston, WV, affected the drinking water of 300,000 people. Yet due to a lack of regulation, virtually no data were available to health officials who dealt with the tragedy.  EDF FIGHTS EVERY DAY FOR CLEAN AIR AND WATER  E DF was a strong voice for public health when many of the nation's clear air rules were written. Through science, advocacy and the courts, we're defending existing standards and closing the remaining loopholes that expose Americans to harmful pollution.  A legal team on the front lines When industry groups challenge bedrock protections, EDF fights back. In 2014 we won important victories: · In April, the Supreme Court upheld EPA rules which will reduce air pollution that  drifts across state lines and causes unhealthy soot and smog in Eastern states. EDF was a party to this case and was instrumental in advocating and defending the new rules. · Also in April, a federal appeals court rejected a coal lobby challenge to a 2012 rule lowering mercury emissions from power plants. Mercury is highly toxic and linked to brain damage in children. EDF defended the standards, which represent one of the biggest public health advances in a generation. · The Supreme Court denied an industry petition to throw out California's low-carbon fuel standard, which cuts climate pollution from transportation fuels. EDF was a party to the case, and co-sponsored the landmark California greenhouse gas law. Clean transportation Following decades of work by EDF to make cars and trucks cleaner, EPA issued a rule which will significantly cut the sulfur content of gasoline. The proposed rule, Tier 3, will dramatically reduce smog, soot and air toxics, saving thousands of lives every year. Efforts in low-income communities Too often, the right to breathe clean air has been denied to people in low-income communities. In Houston, for example, the port abuts low-income neighborhoods. More than one-third of the port's air pollution comes from heavy, diesel-fueled trucks, so EDF created a program that helps truckers buy cleaner trucks. The effort will lead to a dramatic reduction in trucks' diesel emissions, including fine soot and smog-forming nitrogen oxides. Both pollutants have been linked to asthma and respiratory illnesses, and smog is especially harmful to active children. The program is now a model for other ports around the country.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  Environmental Defense Fund's work entails a lasting commitment to preserve natural systems on which life and livelihoods depend. We must maintain the financial strength needed to fund this long-term effort. EDF continued to grow during fiscal 2014, as total operating expenses reached $134 million, an 11% increase over fiscal 2013. Support and revenue of $152 million in fiscal 2014 showed significant fundraising strength. Although the total was similar to fiscal 2013, that prior year included a single foundation gift providing $70 million of new multiyear funding. (Nonprofit accounting principles require us to record income in the year funds are raised, not in the year designated for use.) In fiscal 2014, non-foundation funding increased 44%, with more than half of total support and revenue coming from individual contributions and membership. Program spending in fiscal 2014 was 84% of total expenditures. Development represented 7% of expenses, while management and administration was 6%. Membership and new member acquisition totaled 3%. Over the past four years, EDF's net assets have grown more than 50% to $212 million, providing a strong financial foundation as we embark on the ambitious goals of Blueprint 2020, our strategic plan for the next five years. We are thankful for your support and realize that as more donors recognize EDF's innovative program work, we have an ongoing responsibility to steward your investment well, while delivering strong results for the environment and human health.

EDF-AR-2015.txt,"Breakthroughs ANNUAL REPORT 20 Finding the ways that work  Breakthroughs may seem sudden, but they're usually a long time coming--and they never happen by chance. They come from strategy and perseverance. Take China's historic announcement last fall that the country will launch a national cap-and-trade program by 2017 to cut carbon pollution. It felt like a sudden breath of fresh air and--together with the U.S. Clean Power Plan and commitments made by many other countries--inspired a new era of climate ambition in Paris. But the story began 25 years ago, when EDF economist Dr. Daniel Dudek, who had already helped design the U.S. cap-and-trade program for acid rain, was invited to China to advise officials on creating market-based environmental protection. Dudek, now our VP for Asia, ended up making more than 150 trips to China and offering key technical assistance on the seven carbon-trading pilot programs that gave the Chinese the confidence they needed to take the idea nationwide. Patient work led to a dramatic breakthrough.  Another big breakthrough happened on December 17, when the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan bill to ensure the safety of chemicals in consumer products--the first such reform in 40 years. Once reconciled with the House version and signed by the president, this will mark the culmination of two decades of work by EDF scientist Dr. Richard Denison, a leading expert on chemical safety. Breakthroughs need a strong foundation. For ecosystems, we listened to concerns of private landowners and launched EDF habitat exchanges, which protect wildlife through cooperation rather than conflict with landowners. This year, exchanges became the centerpiece of an effort to protect the greater sage grouse. And for oceans, our strategy to restore fisheries by giving fishermen a greater stake in ocean recovery--which helped triple red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico-- is now established on the U.S. West Coast and starting to take hold in Mexico and Belize. New research by EDF and our allies  shows how, by giving fishermen secure fishing rights, we can have more fish in the sea and more seafood on the plate. The tenacity needed to achieve such breakthroughs would never be possible without EDF's dedicated staff and the generous donors who have backed our work for nearly 50 years. Thank you.  The bald eagle and other magnificent birds of prey have made dramatic recoveries since the U.S. ban on DDT. Founding trustee Dr. Charles Wurster recounts the struggle in DDT Wars: Rescuing Our National Bird, Preventing Cancer, and Creating the Environmental Defense Fund (Oxford University Press, 2015).   A different kind of environmental organization In 1966, a small group of scientists on Long Island began fighting to save the bald eagle and other wildlife from being wiped out by DDT. They teamed up with a lawyer, went to court, and eventually won a U.S. ban on the pesticide. It was the first great victory for the modern American environmental movement-- and the birth of Environmental Defense Fund. Almost 50 years later, EDF remains committed to science-based solutions.>   A growing team in China: EDF VP for Asia Dr. Daniel Dudek (center) with EDF Beijing staff, including managing director Dr. Zhang Jianyu, at Dan's right.  In time, we became the first environmental group to hire economists to work alongside our scientists, lawyers and policy experts. We found that if you make environmental protection pay, people will invent all kinds of ways to make it happen. Because market forces can either hurt or help the natural world, we work to get the incentives right, harnessing the power of markets to reward conservation and deliver the most benefit and protection per dollar. To succeed in the long run, environmental solutions must be economically sustainable.  In a polarized world, EDF remains resolutely nonpartisan, working at the center with an ambitious, pragmatic approach. This gives us --and our more than one million members-- a seat at the table when the big issues are being decided. All in all, our unique approach makes EDF a different kind of environmental group. One of our fisherman partners, Rich Young, the former harbormaster of Crescent City, CA, summed it up this way: ""Environmental Defense Fund is the first group to recognize the human dimension to the crisis.""  Everyone wants to live in a world where the air and water are clean, the people healthy, and the fish and wildlife plentiful. To make that world a reality, EDF works alongside a broad range of allies, including farmers, ranchers, fishermen, corporations, government officials and other nonprofit groups, to build lasting solutions. We know how to litigate and play tough defense-- it's our middle name, after all--but we also know how to use these partnerships to drive lasting progress.  That's why we created habitat exchanges, a sort of Airbnb for wildlife that lets landowners get paid for providing appropriate living space for animals. It's why we help farmers boost food production while using less fertilizer, saving money and cutting pollution at the same time. And it's why we've worked with oil and gas companies to reduce leaks and venting of natural gas--which cuts waste as well as emissions of methane, a potent climate pollutant. Our work with big companies helps drive change through entire business sectors, but we accept no funding from our corporate partners, because our voice must be strong and independent. As we approach our 50th anniversary, EDF is just getting started--because there's so much to be done. In this annual report, you'll find many examples of the fresh thinking that makes EDF a different kind of environmental group. None of it could happen without your support.  ""From millennials to communities of color to people from all across the political spectrum, the strength of our advocacy will be in its diversity."" Emily Reyna Director of Diversity   Guided by science and economics ""More than ever, strong science must underlie the case for action."" Dr. Steven Hamburg Chief Scientist  To manage ocean fisheries, EDF's approach of combining strong science and economics has begun to catch on, with countries seeking our guidance on sustainable fishing policies that benefit both communities and ecosystems.  ""With the right price signals, we can protect the environment in ways that are efficient and fair."" Dr. Frank Convery Chief Economist   EDF's alliance with FedEx produced the first commercially available hybrid midsize trucks. Today, hundreds of fleets use them.  Greening companies for 25 years ""Our corporate partnerships set aggressive goals and improve sustainability performance across industries and supply chains,"" says our VP for corporate partnerships Tom Murray (left). Corporate partnerships have been a cornerstone of EDF's approach ever since we launched our first one with McDonald's 25 years ago. Since then, we've sparked market transformations with industry leaders in shipping, retail, private equity and other sectors.   Rising above partisan politics  In politically polarized Washington, EPA's Clean  Power Plan came under withering attack from  Congressional opponents in 2015--and our  political advocacy partner EDF Action responded  with a vigorous defense.  The Clean Power Plan will cut power plants'  carbon dioxide emissions nearly one-third below  2005 levels by 2030, but it is fiercely resisted by  some in Congress, who introduced at least ten  pieces of legislation in 2015 to block the landmark  program. Our opponents' failure to stop the plan  is a tribute to the effectiveness of EDF Action and  its allies, who have worked tirelessly behind the  scenes for clean air and a stable climate.  ""The plan marks the onset of a clean energy  revolution in the United States, which is exactly  Elizabeth Thompson is president of EDF Action, our sister organization in Washington, as well as VP for U.S. climate and political affairs for Environmental Defense Fund.  why some in Congress are trying so hard to block it,"" says Elizabeth Thompson, president of EDF Action. ""While the rest of the country is moving  forward, they remain stuck in the past.""   Clearing the air: EDF Action runs timely ads that expose misrepresentations by corporate lobbyists.  Opponents of the Clean Power Plan have a huge war chest, but the majority of Americans support the plan--and we're helping amplify their voices.

Michael Bloomberg Former Mayor of New York City    Turning the corner on climate change  ""With realistic actions in key countries, the world's greenhouse gas emissions can start to go down by 2020. This can be done with current technology at reasonable cost."" Gwen Ruta Senior VP Climate and Energy  EDF has a vision for a clean energy future: to stop once and for all the centuries-old rise in global greenhouse gas emissions, and to reach the turning point where emissions level off and begin to decline. It can happen in the next five years-- if countries around the world contribute. ""This is a generational challenge,"" says Gwen Ruta, senior VP for climate and energy. ""Whenever I need a lift, I spend some time with our Climate Corps fellows."" Ruta founded EDF's Climate Corps program, which taps young leaders to find energy savings. ""I'm inspired by their optimism, smarts and unwavering belief that every one of us can make a difference."" Our work in 2015 made clean energy choices easier for tens of millions of people. EDF is helping to sweep away obsolete rules that encourage pollution and replacing them with policies that reward innovation. Last year, the U.S. clean energy market grew 14%--nearly five   times the rate of the overall economy--to $200 billion. That's roughly the size of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. In response, we're helping modernize the power grid so it can support the coming surge of renewable energy. No group can solve these challenges alone. That's why EDF has formed a strategic alliance with The Nature Conservancy to position the United States as a global leader on climate change. This work focuses on building non partisan alliances, developing federal policies that speed the pace of emissions reductions and aiding in the transition to clean energy. We're optimistic about climate, because the world's economies are already showing that they can grow and decarbonize at the same time. Strong commitments by the United States, China and other nations helped usher in a new global agreement in Paris. And the ambitious national goals are being bolstered by decentralized action in states, provincial capitals and businesses. EDF and its allies are at the forefront of these changes. With our partners, we have identified high-impact actions in key countries and sectors that will be enough to reverse the rise in global emissions of both long-lived and short-lived climate pollutants by 2020.  Breakthroughs in 2015 U.S. Clean Power Plan. EPA's bold plan to cut power plant emissions shows that the United States can deliver on its climate commitment. EDF and its allies played a key supporting role. Methane. EDF successfully advocated federal rules that represent a first step in cutting emissions of methane, a potent short-lived pollutant. China. EDF helped lay the groundwork for Beijing's pledge to limit carbon pollution, breaking a decades-long impasse and inspiring other nations. Rainforests. To slow deforestation, EDF helped advance a mechanism for rewarding countries such as Brazil that protect their forests.   Tomorrow's energy today To help transform how America makes and uses electricity, EDF is working in nine states that make up half the U.S. electricity market. ""With $2 trillion in grid investment coming in the next 20 years, we have a once in a generation opportunity to build a resilient system that wastes less energy and gives people clean energy choices,"" says Rory Christian, who directs our New York clean energy program. EDF's Rory Christian (right) visits a solar installation with Con Edison VP Matthew Ketschke. We've teamed up with the utility and state officials to help New York remake its energy system, paving the way for community microgrids and other innovations.   Climate Corps fellow Devashree Ghosh helped develop a microgrid to provide backup power for critical buildings like fire stations, pharmacies and senior housing in Hoboken, NJ, which lost most of its power during Superstorm Sandy. The microgrid provides a template for other cities, like Chicago (seen here).  Training a new generation of business leaders EDF Climate Corps trains MBA and grad students to spot energy savings during fellowships at companies and institutions. They have found ways to save $1.5 billion in energy costs while preventing emissions equal to taking 420,000 cars off the road. Our 2015 projects ranged from skyscrapers in Chicago to a shoe factory in Shanghai. ""The investment is a no-brainer. Our EDF fellows far exceeded expectations,"" says Scott Tew of Ingersoll Rand.  Ending the era of unlimited climate pollution The Clean Power Plan covers 1,000 plants including the oldest and dirtiest, many located near residential neighborhoods. President Obama made history on August 3, 2015, when he unveiled EPA's Clean Power Plan, the first-ever national standards to cut climate pollution from new and existing power plants. The plan sent a clear signal to the world that the United States is serious about climate change. EDF had been working toward this moment for years, alongside allies like the American Lung Association and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The plan requires that the nation's 1,000 fossil fuel power plants--which cause roughly a third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions--cut their emissions 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. EDF members submitted 481,000 public comments. EPA estimates that by 2030 the Clean Power Plan will cut about $8 a month from the average residential utility bill and create tens of thousands of jobs. ""States are in the driver's seat,"" says EDF general counsel Vickie Patton. EPA has given states the flexibility to deploy solutions that reflect local priorities while minimizing costs. Many states and power companies have indicated they can meet the standards and are already making clean energy investments. The fight is far from over. Twenty-seven states have filed lawsuits, and there are ongoing attempts in Congress to derail the plan. ""We're in for a political fistfight,"" says Jeremy Symons, associate   Supreme Court. ""The rhetoric is out there that the Clean Power Plan is bad for business,"" says Mark Buckley, VP for environmental affairs at Staples, ""but that  rules that favor outmoded dirty energy and replacing them with ones that foster a modern, efficient grid. With the Clean Power Plan and investments  is absolutely not the case."" Staples is one of  in clean energy, the era of unlimited carbon  365 companies to send a letter to governors  pollution from U.S. power plants is finally coming  requesting finalization of state plans.  to an end.  Climate action shines in the Golden State California's Global Warming Solutions Act, cosponsored by EDF in 2006, has reduced greenhouse gas emissions even as the state's economy has surged. The law's centerpiece is a cap-andtrade program covering nearly 450 of the largest polluters. California also has set rigorous environmental standards spurring changes in how automakers design cars, utilities generate electricity and refineries make fuel.   In 2015, California approved a protocol for rice growers, designed largely by EDF, that rewards farmers who reduce methane. It's one example of the important role agriculture can play in solving the climate challenge.  ""California is helping set the stage for carbon pricing programs globally, including by linking directly with Quebec's carbon market today."" Dr. Nathaniel Keohane VP Global Climate   China pledges a limit on carbon  EDF's Daniel Dudek (left) serves on China's highest international advisory body on environmental affairs, which reports directly to Premier Li Keqiang (right). The road to stabilizing the world's climate leads through China, which is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, burning as much coal annually as all other countries combined. After years of growth, a rising middle class is calling for a shift to clean, sustainable development. EDF is engaged at every level to help Beijing deliver. In 2014, President Xi Jinping joined President Obama in making historic commitments to curb climate pollution. China promised to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and expand the use of alternatives to fossil fuels to at least one-fifth of the nation's energy mix. In 2015, China pledged to launch a national cap-and-trade program for carbon by 2017, based on a set of seven pilot programs that EDF helped develop. Twenty-five years ago, Beijing called on Dr. Daniel Dudek, now EDF VP for Asia, to participate in the country's first pilot projects with economic incentives for pollution control.   Most recently, EDF provided technical assistance as China launched carbon-trading programs in five cities and two provinces, home to 250 million people. EDF's goal is to help China develop infra structure, policies and regulations needed to shift the country's economy as quickly as possible toward a low-carbon future. China's environ mental transformation is being implemented by a new generation of enforcement officers, many trained through a program EDF set up with Peking University. So far, 29,000 professionals, more than one-third of enforcement officers nationwide, have graduated from our program and fanned out across the country to enforce compliance with environmental laws. Since much of China's pollution comes from factories that export goods, we also began a green supply chain initiative, endorsed by the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic Conference, that uses the purchasing power of the government and multinationals to improve energy efficiency and cut carbon pollution. ""By finding these leverage points, we can rapidly scale change,"" says Dudek.  EDF'S WORK IN CHINA Our projects encompass cities and provinces that account for 40% of China's GDP.    * CARBON TRADING: EDF is providing technical assistance and training to all seven of the government's carbon-trading pilots. These pilots provide the government with the necessary experience to launch a nationwide program by 2017.  LOW-CARBON FARMING: EDF partnered with the State Council's Poverty Alleviation Office to create a program in which 400,000 poor farmers can earn income by reducing carbon emissions through improved agricultural practices, such as turning waste into energy.  GREEN SUPPLY CHAIN: Our green supply chain initiative gives  factories an incentive to slash energy use: a competitive edge when  working with big purchasers such as IKEA and Shanghai GM that  have strict environmental requirements.   Protecting tropical forests Deforestation accounts for about 15% of global carbon emissions, so protecting tropical forests offers one of the biggest immediate opportunities the world has to reduce emissions. EDF is working to help countries that protect their forests to reap the rewards by selling credits in carbon markets.  EDF has been working with state governments and indigenous communities in Brazil to ensure that preserving forests--and their carbon--is more valuable than clearing the land for farming. We're now working with partners like McDonald's to implement strong commitments to ending deforestation.   If left unregulated, aviation's carbon emissions could quadruple by 2050 as new jets take wing. EDF is supporting proposed EPA standards while pushing for international action.  Cutting aviation pollution If aviation were a country, it would be the world's seventh largest climate polluter. EDF is working with the International Civil Aviation Organization to cap carbon pollution from all international flights, using carbon markets to help airlines meet that cap cost-effectively.

Interactive maps on edf.org make pollution visible, and utilities are starting to embrace our methodology.  LEADING ON SCIENCE: THE ALFRED P. SLOAN FOUNDATION ""EDF's research has played an important role in elevating attention to the methane leakage issue,"" says Paul L. Joskow, president of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The foundation has provided grant support for EDF's scientific studies on methane leakage across the natural gas supply chain. ""We support scientific research and are not policy advocates,"" Joskow says. ""EDF stands out in its ability to organize and manage nonpartisan research and to bring stakeholders together to understand and use it effectively."" It was EDF's commitment to developing a sound factual basis for environmental policies that brought the organization to the Sloan Foundation's attention. ""Better science means better understanding of the environment and better public policy,"" says Joskow. ""EDF is influential because it is committed to getting the facts right."" Paul L. Joskow President, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation  ""I attribute a lot of our progress to Environmental Defense Fund. This is an organization that likes results."" Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) From remarks at a press conference announcing the 60th cosponsor of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act   Health  Reducing exposure to chemicals and pollution  ""Every American deserves a strong national law that will protect us from hazardous chemicals."" Dr. Sarah Vogel VP Health  When Sarah Vogel first learned that hazardous chemicals were showing up in human breast milk, she realized that hundreds of toxic substances--many not in existence 50 years ago--were now being passed down from one generation to the next. ""That's when I understood the full meaning of the phrase `pollution is personal,'"" says Vogel, now EDF's VP for health. Today our bodies bear evidence of toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants and diesel trucks, along with hundreds of hazardous chemicals that have slipped through our flimsy chemical safety net. EDF foresees a healthier, more sustainable future, one in which air and water are cleaner and food and consumer goods safer. In 2015, we made significant progress toward that future. We used science, the courts, partnerships, activism and the political process to advance our goals.   After two decades of work by EDF and our allies, the U.S. Senate passed sweeping bipartisan legislation that promises to fix our broken chem ical safety system by setting strong, health-based standards against which all chemicals will be assessed. Now EDF will work with members of both parties to ensure that the strongest possible bill gets through the House-Senate negotiations and arrives on the president's desk. Harmful substances that can cause poor health and disease are with us at every stage of our lives. They're found in the food we eat, the products we buy and the air we breathe. For that reason, every EDF program works on improving the health of people, their communities and the natural systems on which human health depends.  Safeguarding human health Congress is closer than ever to reforming the Toxic Substances Control Act and establishing a law that will finally work to protect Americans from hazardous chemicals. EDF's partnership with Walmart to remove potentially dangerous chemicals from the products on its shelves triggered changes by other retailers and product manufacturers. In 2015, we went to court to defend the EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which slash deadly mercury and other pollutants from coal-fired power plants. The EDF-backed citizens group Moms Clean Air Force helped advance protections against air pollution and toxic chemicals.   Rethinking the supply chain Since 2009, EDF has worked with Walmart to replace hazardous chemicals in everyday products on its shelves. In response, suppliers have reformulated many products to replace chemicals of concern with safer substitutes, and Walmart is publishing all the ingredients of its private label products. Note: EDF accepts no funding from Walmart or any other corporate partners, or from their corporate foundations. We do accept funding from private foundations and individuals.    Lifting the veil on chemical exposure Just what chemicals are we exposed to in everyday life? No one knows. But EDF is helping to answer that question with new wristband technology that can detect more than 1,400 chemicals. We enlisted volunteers to wear the wristbands, and the results are eyeopening. They show that hazardous chemicals are pervasive in our daily environment. That's why the need to act on chemicals is urgent. One wearer of a wristband came into contact with all these chemicals during a single week. Analysis did not determine level of exposure or if chemicals were absorbed into the body.   A relentless voice for safer chemicals  EDF scientist Dr. Richard Denison is a leading force for Congressional action on chemical safety. The long fight to reform America's obsolete chemical safety law has reached critical mass. First passed in 1976--the year Apple sold its first computer--the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) has proved so woefully inadequate that EPA hasn't been able to control even known human carcinogens like formaldehyde. In almost 40 years, TSCA has required testing of only about 3% of the 85,000 chemicals available for use. Nearly two decades ago, EDF began a long quest for fundamental reform. In 1997, we published Toxic Ignorance, a seminal report which revealed that even the most common chemicals lacked basic health data. Since then, we've worked with EPA, states, and health, labor, business and consumer groups to push TSCA reform. From the beginning, EDF's Dr. Richard Denison was at the center of this process. He worked with all parties, overcoming resistance   A legacy of TSCA: Most couches in the U.S. contain at least one potentially hazardous flame-retardant chemical.  10 trillion Pounds of chemicals produced per year in the United States 24 Number of years since EPA last tried (and failed) to regulate a chemical under TSCA (asbestos)  from industry opponents.

Tanya Brown (left) joined Moms Clean Air Force because her ten-year-old daughter Sanaa (center) suffers from asthma. ""I've finally started connecting the dots between the health of the environment and the health of my family,"" says Brown, who was invited on stage when President Obama unveiled the Clean Power Plan. Elected officials, listen to your mothers No one is more committed to her child's health than a mother. Moms Clean Air Force is an EDF-backed community of more than 570,000 parents united against air pollution and climate change. Visiting the White House, governors' mansions and legislators nationwide, this clean air constituency is a clear and consistent voice holding elected officials accountable.   Exposure to mercury through eating contaminated fish can lead to severe neurological problems.  EDF goes to court to defend mercury rule EDF has long fought to limit toxic mercury from power plants, culminating in a strong 2011 EPA rule that will safeguard the health of children. Most power plants now comply with the mercury rule, but opponents went to court, and EDF stepped in to fight for the rule. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court directed EPA to re-evaluate the costs of the rule, which EPA will soon address.   Environmental justice for low-income communities  Too often, the right to breathe clean air has  been denied to low-income communities and communities of color. People living near the nationÕs ports, truck routes and industrial facilities are disproportionately exposed to dangerous air pollution. ÒPeople who live in pollution hot spots face an increased health risk from smog and fine particles and toxics like benzene and mercury,Ó says Dr. Elena Craft, an EDF toxicologist who works with these communities. Smog is a particular problem, contributing to heart and lung diseases and worsening asthma.Refineries are a big contributor to smog and air toxics, but federal rules on refinery pollution are weak. Thanks in part to EDFÕs advocacy, EPA in 2015 announced stronger rules for regulating toxic air emissions from refineries. Then, after a lawsuit filed by EDF and others, EPA tightened the national air quality standard for ozone,  the main cause of smog.Cars and trucks are the largest source of smog-forming pollutants. EDF is helping slash such pollution from trucks for the 18 million mostly low-income people who live near AmericaÕs ports. At the port of Houston, one of the nationÕs busiest, we helped develop a low-interest loan and grant program that helps the portÕs truckers replace older, polluting trucks with new models. In 2015, EPA expanded the program.Nationwide, big freight trucks are getting a makeover, too: Proposed new standards, which EDF and our allies helped secure, will make heavy trucks almost 25% more efficient. Improved engine standards mean less smogÑand that means Americans with lung ailments can breathe a little easier. EDF helped activists such as Houston's Yudith Nieto acquire air samplers that for the first time provide a more accurate picture of what they're breathing. ""At the end of the day, there has to be hope,"" says Nieto, ""hope that our voices will be heard."" ""Dr. Elena Craft and EDF have helped us build partnerships that can be a model for other ports around the country,"" says EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy (right), with Craft in Houston.  A RIPPLE EFFECT: STEPHANIE BARKO As a young child in Houston in the 1960s, Stephanie Barko ran behind trucks that were spraying DDT, as many children did before the pesticide was banned. ""We've come a long way since then,"" says Barko, ""but chemicals are still everywhere. It's an outrage that we have so little regulation."" Barko trusts EDF to fight for reform of the nation's weak and outdated chemical safety law and to help retailers move toward selling safer products. That's one reason she has included EDF in her estate plans. A literary publicist, Barko calls on authors and bloggers she knows to fight pollution through Moms Clean Air Force, an EDF-backed campaign. ""It's amazing the ripple effect one person's action can have,"" she says. ""EDF understands that working with retailers is a critical part of the solution to get dangerous chemicals off shelves."" Stephanie Barko  ""The combination of rights-based management and fully protected marine reserves, long advocated by EDF, gives me great hope that we can revive global fisheries."" Dr. Jane Lubchenco Former Administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Vice Chair, EDF Board of Trustees   Oceans   More fish in the water, more food on the plate  ""When fishermen see the ocean as a renewable resource, they will protect it. Together, we then can bring the ocean back to life."" Amanda Leland Senior VP Oceans  Growing up in New England, Amanda Leland always loved the sea. Her great-grandfather was a lobsterman, and as a kid she would fish for ""blues"" with her grandfather. The decline of the New England cod fishery inspired her career in marine science. Leland, now EDF's senior VP for oceans, recalls a fisherman once telling her, ""If I don't catch the last fish, someone else will."" She grew convinced that fishermen shouldn't have to choose between conserving the resource and providing for their families. And as a marine biologist, she knew that smart management could unleash the ocean's natural resilience and achieve a dramatic recovery in fish populations. EDF has championed an innovative approach that grants fishermen secure rights to fish, now and in the future. This creates more of an incentive to fish sustainably, because local fishermen and their communities benefit economically as the fishery grows and catch limits are raised. ""With secure fishing rights,"" says Leland, ""fishermen's incentives flip from catching as much as possible today to protecting the fishery for the long term."" Globally, three billion people rely on seafood as an important source of protein, but 40% of the world's fisheries are in trouble. Climate change, habitat loss, ocean pollution and other threats  contribute to the problem, but overfishing is the leading cause of fishery depletion worldwide. Now, new research by EDF and partners at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of Washington quantifies the immense potential of fisheries to recover if we manage them properly. Presented at the 2015 World Ocean Summit in Lisbon, our research shows that sustainable fishing could more than double the number of fish in the water by 2050, in most places, when compared to current trends. A typical fishery could recover in just nine years. EDF's growing list of successes in the United States, Belize and Mexico demonstrates what's possible with the right set of policies and incentives. We're now focusing on a dozen governments that account for more than three-fifths of the global catch, including the European Union, where we helped reform the common fisheries policy, committing Europe to end overfishing by 2020. Reforms at this scale could tip the global fishing economy so that sustainable methods of catching fish take hold worldwide.  How fishing rights work With secure fishing rights, a percentage share of the allowed catch--or a fishing area-- is dedicated to individual fishermen, communities or fishery associations. The sustainable limit on the total catch is determined each year. Fishermen then have the flexibility to fish when they choose, so long as they stay within the limit.  PROBLEM: TOO MANY BOATS, TOO FEW FISH  A SOLUTION BASED ON SCIENCE  PROTECTED  In a classic ""tragedy of the commons,"" fishermen try to catch the last fish before someone else does. In the frenzy, catch limits are breached, habitats are destroyed and fish are wasted, thus accelerating a downward spiral that can only end in collapse.  Scientists and policy makers determine a sustainable limit for each fishery that allows fish populations to rebound. Fishermen--or communities-- are assigned percentage shares, based on their catch history. As fish populations recover, the percentage shares grow.   FISHERMEN CONTROL THEIR DESTINY  RETURN TO ABUNDANCE  As owners of a renewable asset, fishermen now have a sense of security and take pride in their stewardship of the fishery for the long haul. With renewed dignity as providers for their families, they look forward to handing down their secure share of the catch to their children.  Many fishermen who were once opponents of protected areas have become strong advocates. Secure fishing rights provide more fish in the water, more food on the plate and more prosperity for fishermen and fishing communities.  Granting fishermen secure fishing rights, known as catch shares in the United States, has proven successful in more than 200 fisheries around the world. The approach works because it aligns the needs of fishermen with the needs of the oceans and all the people who depend on them for food.   The path of U.S. fisheries reform  For centuries, people have thought of the oceans  as an inexhaustible source of seafood.

Gulf Wild: The next wave in sustainable seafood Wouldn't it be nice to know where the fish on your plate came from--and that it was caught sustainably? In the Gulf of Mexico, red snapper and grouper fishermen worked with EDF to create Gulf Wild, a system for verifying the safety, sustainability and location of their catch. At a time when up to a third of the seafood sold in the U.S. is mislabeled, the Gulf Wild label guarantees authenticity. FROM GULF Under catch shares, fishermen are assigned a percentage of the scientifically determined allowable annual catch. This permits them to fish when weather and market prices are good--and gives them an incentive to conserve, because their shares grow as fish populations recover.  TO DOCK Fishermen who are part of Gulf Wild, like Buddy Guindon, sign a ""conservation covenant"" that commits them to practices above and beyond federal regulations. This reduces waste. ""We're catching bigger fish,"" says Guindon, ""and our prices at the dock have increased.""   TO MARKETS The recovery of the fishery has been so remarkable that the Monterey Bay Aquarium took Gulf red snapper off the ""Avoid"" list of its Seafood Watch guide in 2013. Now consumers nationwide can get a steady supply of fresh, sustainably caught fish.  TO THE DINNER PL ATE As Gulf red snapper stocks rebound, chefs like Rick Moonen are featuring freshly caught snapper on their menus. More than 1.2 million Gulf Wild fish have been sold since the program began in 2011.  ""This is exactly what diners are demanding. They want to know that the Gulf fish we are buying is authentic, safe and from a sustainable fishery. Gulf Wild provides that assurance."" Chef Rick Moonen RM Seafood, Las Vegas, NV  Reviving fisheries around the world  With the success of catch shares in U.S. waters,  EDF scientists have been asked to advise on  fishery management in other countries around  the world. Similar approaches can work for large  commercial fisheries in Europe and elsewhere,  as well as for small-scale fisheries within a few  miles of shore. Nearly half the wild fish people  eat are caught in small-scale fisheries, many of  which are poorly managed or have no rules at all.  Working with local fishermen and  governments, EDF is using science to show how  sustainable management can turn the tide.

AN OCEANS CHAMPION: K ATHRYN MURDOCH ""Overfishing is a problem we can turn around in years-- not decades,"" says Kathryn Murdoch, speaking of her close partnership with EDF's staff to revive the world's fisheries. Murdoch, an avid scuba diver, is an EDF trustee and co-founder of the Quadrivium Foundation with her husband, James Murdoch. ""I believe in EDF because they understand human nature,"" she says. ""Most people want to do the right thing, but they need help to align their economic needs with conservation goals. That's where EDF excels."" Murdoch believes that most people see environmental problems as too big and hopeless. ""EDF shows there are solutions. We can do this,"" she says. It's a message she wants to share. ""You don't have to be an environmentalist. People who care about poverty, health, children and nutrition can all get behind this work.""  ""Every bit of what EDF does is grounded in science. I really respect that.""  Kathryn Murdoch   ""EDF habitat exchanges offer conservation options suited to our changing circumstances. Every credit sale makes species and habitat better off."" Steve McCormick Former President and CEO, The Nature Conservancy   Ecosystems  Making conservation pay  ""If we are going to meet our growing needs for food and water and energy, we will have to do it in ways that stop harming the environment and start helping the ecosystems we depend on to survive."" David Festa Senior VP Ecosystems  Twenty years ago, EDF wanted to test a new idea: Would offering rewards for practices that improve ecosystems result in the widespread adoption of those practices? Acting on the theory that most private landowners want to be good stewards, we introduced a way for them to protect habitat without restrictions that kept them from making a living. The result--Safe Harbor--saved more than four million acres of prime habitat. Ever since, EDF has sought to balance human interests with the needs of ecosystems. We mobilize financial, legal and technical incentives to reward landowners who restore habitat and reduce pollution. With climate change putting added stress on ecosystems today, we need to protect our land, water and wildlife at a scale never before attempted. EDF aims to increase the resilience of these systems so they can thrive, even under   stress. That means working hand in hand with the people whose livelihoods are tied to healthy land and water. Today, thanks to public-private partnerships launched by EDF, landowners nationwide are frontline stewards of clean water, healthy air, vibrant habitat and a stable climate. Where EDF and its partners work, coastal erosion, fertilizer runoff, habitat loss and water consumption are being decreased. And landowners are discovering that when they improve land and freshwater systems, they save money. ""Inevitably, when I'm on a farm or a ranch, the owner often starts talking about the wildlife and the water quality,"" says David Festa, EDF's senior VP for ecosystems. ""The habitat they restore is often their favorite part of the ranch. They can't stop talking about it.""  EDF landowner partners: Apply fertilizer precisely to reduce nutrient runoff harmful to aquatic life, improve water quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Create and improve wildlife habitat to help at-risk species. Restore wetlands to filter pollution, protect communities from floods and recharge groundwater, building resilience against droughts. Improve soil health to reduce the impacts of climate change and enhance food security.   A Hill Country success Fort Hood Army Base in Texas is home to the largest population of golden-cheeked warblers. The base needed to conduct maneuvers, so EDF created a habitat exchange, allowing the Army to pay nearby ranchers to improve warbler habitat on their properties. Once-skeptical landowners expanded habitat. The result? The known population of warblers nearly doubled from 5,000 to 9,000 birds. The cost? One-eighth of what easements would have cost.

EDF has been working to make sure the money leaves coastal communities better off, while helping to lead science and policy efforts to restore the state's vanishing coastal wetlands.  In 2015, EDF wrapped up a competition to get the world's best minds to reimagine a thriving delta for people, wildlife and industry. The winning designs all push for reconnecting the Mississippi River to the wetlands it built.

ALLIES FOR WILDLIFE ""We are looking for practical solutions that work for the environment and for people, and that is EDF's mission,"" says Gary Knoblock, lead program officer for the S. D.

""Habitat exchanges help make landowners allies in protecting habitat, and that's a powerful paradigm shift,"" says Knoblock. ""Landowners and state and local government officials are keenly interested in new approaches that can work."" The foundation shares EDF's focus on results. ""With habitat exchanges, we can measure concrete benefits to the ecosystem from the money spent on conservation,"" Knoblock says. ""Previously, that's been quite hard to do.""

EDF-climate-change.txt,"Special Report Winter 2014 Prepared for Leadership Team Members  Can we save ourselves from climate change?  AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER  Browning  Writer and journalist Dominique Browning met recently with Princeton professor and respected climate scientist, Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, to get his latest views on the science and politics of climate change. With global emissions still rising, can a climate scientist still have hope for the future?  I went to see Dr. Michael Oppenheimer with some trepidation, expecting that I would have to pick myself up off the floor after our interview. After all, if anyone understands the true nature of our changing climate, and the impact of greenhouse gas pollution on our way of life, it is a scientist whose lifelong passion has been the study of atmospheric gases.  I wanted to know how scientists really talk to each other, when the rest of us aren't in the room. Are they saying we're cooked? I figured I would be pretty depressed at the end of our hour together.  ""Well, I suppose that depends on whether your mother dropped you on your head when you were three years old,"" Oppenheimer said, laughing. ""I'm an optimist.""  I left Dr. Oppenheimer's office feeling hopeful, yet my sense of urgency was renewed: this is a life-altering problem. I am inspired to keep up the pressure on our president, on our legislators, and on our business innovators and leaders, to address the critical problem of climate change, giving it the priority it demands.   Dr. Oppenheimer, how is climate change different from any other problem we've ever had to face? Pollution problems are simple. Stop putting out the pollution--stop the offending activity-- and the problem goes away. Greenhouse gas pollution is not like any other pollution problem we have ever experienced in one key way. It might be irreversible. And we cannot ever forget this. Greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades, even centuries, after they are released.  So we are gambling with humanity, aren't we?  There is a strong, scientific case for urgency in stopping greenhouse gas pollution. And it is this: we don't really know how bad things will become. As scientists, we create windows by doing the best we can to produce scenarios of danger. That's where the 2 degree warming target we're all talking about comes from. But we really don't want to let climate change get that far either--because too many unknowable things kick in.  Before we get climate change turned around, we could go over a cliff. We just don't know where that cliff is.  We don't want to create a problem too big to manage. Before we get climate change turned around, we could go over a cliff. We just don't know where that cliff is.   In NYC we are talking about how to manage sea level rise of as much as five feet over the 21st century. But if we get to the point where the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting completely, even disappearing, we are talking about a 30 to 40 ft. sea level rise over subsequent centuries. No coastal city will be able to handle that. Is there anything in our collective ""tool kit""--as a democracy-- that has prepared us for dealing with a problem as calamitous as climate change? We've always lived in a cloud of uncertainty about the world around us--and about what we know about risk. Just because you live with it, doesn't mean you let it go. We have the power to make things happen. Things do look terrible. But, we've been here before. We have been in terrible predicaments, as a human race. From the time I was born until I was forty, we lived under a cloud of fear that the world would be destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. It was a tense, hostile time in this country. Students on campuses were being tear-gassed. And we were demonstrating for peace! Everyone was worried that we were all going to be blown up by the Russians. I can't tell you how much that affected my life--all of our lives. Between 1945 and 1986 we built up a lot of infrastructure to make sure we would not blow each other up with weapons of mass destruction. It took years. And a great deal of hard work. But we did it. We more or less fixed that terrible mess, one that looked like it would kill us all. We cannot expect climate treaties to happen overnight.  How concerned should we be about passing specific thresholds of carbon emissions in the atmosphere?  Going from say, 390 parts per million [referring to concentration of carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere] to 400 doesn't change the climate in any notable way, particularly in the near  term. It's more a point above which the  Some of the changes we've risks clearly escalate over time, rather than  seen already, which as  a sharp threshold.  recently as the mid-1990s were not expected to occur so soon or at all.  Taking the longer perspective, some of the changes we've seen already, which as recently as the mid-1990s were not expected to occur so soon or at all, include: rapid shrinkage at  the margins of the ice sheets in Greenland  and Antarctica contributing to an acceleration of sea level rise, more intense heavy precipitation events, and large reductions in the Arctic summer sea ice pack.  Knowing how enormous a problem this is, how do you get out of bed in the morning? Some people--and some scientists--just take a bleak view of the world. I'm not one of them. I have seen amazing things happen in the course of my lifetime, things I never dreamed could happen. People have a way of messing things up. But we also fix things. We clean up after ourselves-- even though, sometimes, it seems as our ability to solve problems is not as good as our ability to create them. I don't want to live in a world where I have to be worried all the time. I choose to remain optimistic.  How do you ground your optimism in reality? I mean, it can't just be a willful leap of faith, can it? On climate change, I remain optimistic--with good reason. Actually, these days, I have three good reasons. And they all have to do with how unknowable the future is. Things happen that surprise us, things that we did not expect. They change the course of events. 1. We have a president who finally seems to want to build a legacy around addressing the climate problem. His administration's new fuel efficiency standards are a really big deal. And so are the new carbon pollution rules proposed by the EPA. He is sending powerful signals to the world, and to our own citizens, about his willingness to step up and be a leader in the fight against climate change. He is pulling us (although sometimes too quietly) into a new era in terms of energy. And what he proposes is doable. 2. Our ability to tap into reserves of shale gas was totally unpredicted. Natural gas can be a huge help--if we don't let the methane leak out during development and make the climate even worse. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. That is why it is so critical that the gas developers are strongly regulated and carefully monitored. It has to be leakproof. But we are seeing carbon emissions drop hugely because of all the natural gas coming online. That's good. I don't buy the argument that natural gas development distracts us from investing in renew ables. They can work hand in hand. It is not clear that there is a trade-off. Meanwhile, people want abundant and inexpensive energy--all over the world. Technology will never cease to amaze--and surprise--us. Our energy systems are changing, radically. Utilities will be forced to become less centralized and to encourage distributed power.  We have big decisions to make about what the grid of the future will look like. Using energy more efficiently can be extremely helpful. And we should stop fighting every two years about renewable tax credits. It creates too much uncertainty and inefficiency. 3. China. The Chinese have already driven down the price of solar energy to levels we wouldn't have dreamed of ten years ago. They've made solar into a big buy. Germany's political decision to rely so heavily on renewa bles--50% by 2020--was made much easier by the Chinese ability to get a market going. The Chinese government knows that it will have a revolution on its hands if it continues to pollute the air and poison people. So it will make big changes, quickly. Is climate change a problem that is too big for a democracy to handle? I'm sure the alternatives are worse: a dictator global government on environment. But we need some sort of global agreement--and that seems so difficult to achieve; we can't even get consensus on what to do in this country. My father was into politics. My mother was into nature. I see those two strands throughout my life. One of the most interesting things about my life's work has been exploring a big question: How do you turn scientific consensus into a political mandate? Right now, I am teaching a course on International Treaties at the NYU Law School. We're exploring how countries come together to make strong, binding treaties. What are the key elements? How do countries build trust, and how do they build institutions that are capable of supporting treaties?  The United States isn't the only player here anymore. It isn't even the most important player. And right now, we have factions within our own government that don't even want governments, much less treaties. We seem unable to set political partisanship aside, even in the face of a terrible--global--problem. So our own infrastructure isn't functioning properly.  The United States isn't the only player here anymore. It isn't even the most important player.  Of course, if we could get China, the United States, and the European Union in a room and agree to stop greenhouse gas pollution quickly, the problem would be solved. Unfortunately, that is not going to happen anytime soon. But if I could choose my solution, it would be great to have a climate treaty among key nations.  How do you talk about climate peril with your own children? How do you educate them, without terrifying them? I try not to take my work home with me every night. But I don't have to talk about climate change at the dinner table for my children to know all about it. My daughter is 23 and my son is 15. I don't have to indoctrinate them, even if I wanted to. Climate change is in the air now. It is embedded in the culture they are growing up in. It is mentioned in movies, on television, by celebrities. Young people aren't deniers. Youth is always the answer. To paraphrase Max Planck, intellectual progress is made one funeral at a time.   It will take a long time to shed a generation of deniers. Back to getting out of bed in the morning: where does hope come from? Look, we're used to living with messes. Everybody is--every day. Things feel like a mess in so many parts of our lives, but if you struggle, you can make them better. People don't give up. We find better ways to get things done. Paralysis is ridiculous. It isn't the human story. It isn't what we do. We need luck. And we need hard work. What do you see as the biggest, most alarming problem as you think about how we tackle climate change? The biggest problem? We don't really know how close to disaster we are. There is a potential for a very bad outcome no matter what we do. You have to let this motivate you--and not paralyze you. If a problem looks too daunting, people are paralyzed. It is better to talk about solutions that extract creative thinking. It is better to keep flexibility in our system--and in a democracy, that can happen, beautifully, when it is working. There is no one solution to climate change. There will be many. We don't even know now where all the solutions are going to come from. ""A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new genera tion grows up that is familiar with it."" --Max Planck  "
EDF-CLimate-stability.txt,"Solutions Vol. 46, No. 1 / Winter 2015  BLUEPRINT FOR CLIMATE STABILITY GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS HAVE BEEN CLIMBING FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. EDF HAS A PLAN TO REVERSE THAT TREND BY 2020--AND TURN THE CORNER TOWARD CLIMATE STABILITY.  A world apart President Obama recently announced the world's largest network of marine protected areas, expanding a reserve that EDF was instrumental in creating in 2009. Larger than California and Texas combined, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument is a biodiversity hotspot rich in ancient coral reefs and seamounts. The area is now off limits to deep sea mining and most commercial fishing--forever.   PACIFIC STOCK  LOOKING FORWARD  2014: The year in review In november, when president obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced ambitious goals to cut global warming pollution, it was more than just another diplomatic handshake. I believe this announcement will change the way nations approach climate action: The argument that America can't act because China won't act can finally be put to rest. This and other breakthroughs in 2014 give me hope that we can still turn the corner toward a stable climate before it is too late (see story, p. 8). EDF staffers in Beijing are helping China reduce carbon pollution, and I'm proud to say we played a key role in many other notable environmental achievements in 2014. Here are just a few: Colorado pioneers pollution controls. In February, Colorado adopted landmark regulations to substantially reduce air pollution from the state's oil and gas industry--including the first anywhere in the U.S. to directly control emissions of methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. The rules, which EDF helped develop, will cut air pollution as much as getting all the cars and trucks off the road in Colorado. A plan to cut carbon from power plants. In June, EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, which will impose the first-ever national limits on carbon pollution from power plants. The plan encourages investors, inventors and entrepreneurs to find new ways to cut pollution. And it gives industry flexibility to find the most efficient path to a clean future. More than 480,000 EDF members have raised their voices in support of the plan. Getting toxics out of the home. Shoppers might assume the law requires chemicals in everyday products like baby lotion to be proven safe, but it's not so. That's why EDF is fighting for strong regulations. In 2014, Walmart rolled out a policy developed with EDF to phase out potentially harmful ingredients in tens of thousands of products in its U.S. stores. Walmart's policy will drive change throughout the industry. Restoring the oceans to abundance. On the West Coast, groundfish are on the rebound, largely because of a new management system, called catch shares, that EDF helped implement. In August, the Monterey Bay Aquarium upgraded the sustainability rating of 21 species of Pacific rockfish, flounder and sole in its seafood guide. A legendary river runs free. For almost half a century, the Colorado River has dried up before reaching the sea. But in 2014 the river again ran its full course, thanks to a deal EDF helped broker between the U.S. and Mexico. A ""pulse flow"" designed to mimic spring floods provided scientists with clues to revitalize the delta. These advances resulted from the efforts of many people over many years. We appreciate your steadfast support. It makes our work possible. EDF President  Environmental Defense Fund's mission is to preserve the natural systems on which all life depends.

Cleaner trucks are a big hit Last year was a banner year for truck sales, which ran 20% higher than in 2013. What's helping drive the boom is the fact that 2014 heavy trucks have lower operating costs. They use less fuel thanks to strong federal efficiency standards EDF helped push through. ""Federal standards can foster the innovation necessary to bring lower-emitting trucks to market,"" says EDF manager Jason Mathers. ""In 2015, we can make these standards even better."" The new standards will cut CO2 emissions from heavy trucks by 298 million tons over the life of all trucks produced between 2014 and 2018.  U.S. moms fight back on climate No one is more fiercely protective of her child's health and safety than a mother. When outgoing Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) last year signed a bill giving politicians authority to veto any climate plan required by EPA's Clean Power Plan, Moms Clean Air Force (MCAF) jumped into action. ""This bill puts politics over science and the health and safety of Pennsylvania families at risk,"" says MCAF's Gretchen Dahlkemper. Power plants account for 46% of the state's carbon pollution. The EDF-backed band of mothers is taking its case to the new governor, Tom Wolf (D), who will take office in January. ""Our hope is that the governor will take a leadership role and craft a plan that meets EPA's goals and grows the economy,"" says Dahlkemper.

Get up-to-the-minute news and become part of the conversation at .  JULIA ROBINSON  Reel reform: Urging anglers to come on board.  The case for reforming recreational fishing nationwide  In the Gulf of Mexico, the commercial catch share program for red snapper, which EDF helped design, has been a huge success. Since the program began in 2007, the Gulf snapper population has more than tripled. But recreational fishing, which accounts for half of landings, is not part of the program and is poorly managed, leading to large discards of fish. Recreational fishermen have exceeded the biologically sustainable catch limit by 50% over the last couple of years. EDF helped win a legal victory in March requiring improved management. We also helped recreational fishermen launch a catch share pilot program for headboats, or large charter boats, which could be a model for managing recreational fishing. The initiative, called the Gulf Headboat Collaborative, had 17 vessels in 2014. One partner was Randy Boggs, who operates Reel Surprise Charters out of Orange Beach, AL. ""Last year was one  of our best years ever,"" he says. ""We stayed within our quota, made more money and have been totally sustainable."" Member boats can take customers fishing yearround under strict catch limits, while those not in the program could only fish nine days in 2014. Twenty boats have signed up for 2015. ""Charter boat captains have incentives similar to commercial fishermen,"" says EDF economist Dr. Daniel Willard. ""Their livelihoods depend on a healthy fishery."" MILLENNIALS RISING At 80 million strong, the millennial generation is the largest in American history. Now, with help from EDF, these young people are starting to speak up--and vote--for the environment.  Elaine Phillips, a Colorado State University student, holds up a card pledging to vote for climate protection.  Defend Our Future recruits young voters  Millennials now outnumber baby boomers--and they care deeply about climate. The problem is, they don't often vote in midterm elections. In last November's elections, an EDF campaign aimed at getting millennials to the polls gathered more than 125,000 pledges to vote for climate action. More than 100,000 of those pledges came from Colorado, the pilot state for the new effort. The nonpartisan campaign, Defend Our Future, used a mix of digital, social media and data targeting technologies, along with traditional boots-on-theground organizing, to collect the pledges. The campaign started with organizers at Colorado State University and the University of Colorado Boulder. Our partners included national groups such as  Voto Latino and Rock the Vote. National polling shows that Latino voters overwhelmingly support climate action. The campaign worked: the turnout among young voters in Colorado improved by more than 20% over turnout in the last midterm election in 2010. ""I'm 20 years old, so climate change will have a huge impact on my life,"" said Bianca Buium, the 100,000th person to sign the pledge. ""I haven't been involved in politics before, but if we just ignore this problem, politicians will, too."" In future elections, Defend Our Future will expand to other states. ""Millennials will live with the most serious consequences of climate change,"" says Dr. Alicia Kolar Prevost, who directs the initiative. ""They care, and they'll be voting for years to come."" MEMBER SPOTLIGHT EDF's new Ambassador Community There are activists. Then there are superactivists--like Sarah Davis. She's an EDF lead ambassador, part of a network of committed doers who are rallying their communities to defend the environment. Launched in early 2014, EDF's Ambassador Community provides a way for people to share their passion for the environment with friends and neighbors. It now has chapters in California, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, with more launching soon. ""Our members want to do more than write a check,"" says project manager Alysa Perez. ""They want to get involved locally."" When EDF approached Davis to lead a chapter in Raleigh, NC, ""I was nervous,"" recalls Davis, who works as an air quality specialist. ""But EDF staff were so helpful. I've learned so much."" Davis's mission is to raise awareness of climate change. ""Often people don't understand how it's affecting them locally now,"" she says. A champion of environmental causes, she spent a summer rescuing injured sea turtles. Today, she's recruiting like-minded folks in Raleigh to make their voices heard. At one event, the speaker offered tips on how to talk to climate deniers. ""If you can influence just a few people,"" says Davis, ""they will influence others."" Hers is now the largest chapter. Join a chapter, become an ambassador and spread the word! Learn more at ambassadors.edf.org For Sarah Davis, activism means more than just pressing a button.    Young energy sleuths hunt carbon pollution  When gina melekh was growing up in st. petersburg, Russia, her mother washed and reused plastic bags, and dried the laundry on a clothesline strung in the kitchen. Arriving in the United States at age 19, Melekh was thrilled with America's abundance, but also shocked. ""It was painfully obvious how wasteful society is,"" she says. As an EDF Climate Corps fellow in 2014, Melekh is doing something about that waste and helping fight global warming at the same time. Working for the City of Baltimore, she designed an energy roadmap for the city government and presented her plan directly to the mayor. City officials were so impressed they offered her a full-time job to implement her plan. ""Most people get an MBA to go into banking. I went the other way--I left banking and got an MBA to promote sustainability,"" says Melekh. EDF Climate Corps pairs graduate students with businesses, universities and cities, where they ferret out energy waste. Since the program's inception in 2008, more than 500 Climate Corps fellows have uncovered $1.4 billion in energy savings--enough to avoid the annual emissions of 400,000 cars. Among the 305 participating organizations that have  hosted fellows are Apple, McDonald's and Walmart. Cities served include Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles. Many companies are repeat customers. Says Christina Page, director of climate and energy strategy at Yahoo!: ""We are saving tens of millions of kilowatt hours per year from projects identified by our first Climate Corps fellow. We jumped at the chance to sign up again."" In 2014, EDF Climate Corps took on waste in commercial real estate in Chicago. Through Climate Corps, EDF partnered with the city and placed ten fellows at two dozen Chicago buildings. They helped building operators identify $1.6 million in savings. Pakistan native Abdul Wadood, an engineering management graduate student at Duke University, spent the summer at the Merchandise Mart. Armed with a floor plan and a clipboard, Wadood tracked the building's after-hours energy use by reading hundreds of electric meters over the course of two nights. These two all-night treks revealed that onethird of tenants were responsible for 90% of nighttime energy use. Wadood then developed strategies to help those tenants lower their energy use. A key goal of EDF Climate Corps is to change the way institutions use energy. China was an obvious target, and in 2014,  our fellows were invited to work there as well. Six fellows found energy savings at Apple, Cummins, Legrand, McDonald's and Walmart facilities in China. Whether it's in China or Chicago, EDF Climate Corps fellows form a new generation of green leaders. Sixty percent of them go on to work in fields related to sustainability--and 100% leave the program equipped to become strong leaders in the fight against climate change. Baltimore's energy maven Gina Melekh.   EDF'S PRESIDENT SURVEYS FIVE POWERFUL TRENDS THAT ARE DRIVING MOMENTUM FOR CLIMATE ACTION AND DESCRIBES AN AMBITIOUS PLAN TO REIN IN GLOBAL EMISSIONS BY 2020. WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE-- BUT TOGETHER, WE CAN TURN THE CORNER TOWARD A SAFER CLIMATE.  Every day brings another frightening headline about climate change, so I'm inspired whenever I see some truly positive news. Some of the best climate news ever came in November, when the United States and China made a historic announcement to cut global warming pollution. A New York Times editorial called it ""a major breakthrough"" that sends a powerful signal to the rest of the world. I call it a game-changer, and it's one of the reasons I am optimistic we can prevail against climate change. Here are my Top Five Reasons for Hope: 1. The China­U.S. announcement sends the most powerful market signal ever for clean energy. The world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters have committed themselves to the clean energy path. Each recognizes the danger of being left behind in what amounts to a 21st century arms race--the battle for dominance of the new energy economy. More importantly, each recognizes the urgent need to control greenhouse gas emissions. With this announcement, the argument that the United States can't act because China won't act has finally begun to fade. Spurred by severe air pollution and the growing costs of climate impacts, China committed to having its carbon emissions peak by 2030 at the latest. To meet this pledge, the country must act now to deploy a suite of actions, including ramping up investment in solar and wind energy. With EDF's help, the Chinese have already launched seven pilot carbon trading programs, covering almost 250 million people and 1.3 billion tons of carbon. Beijing also recently announced its intention to create a national carbon market by 2016.  The American commitment--to cut emissions by 26­28% below 2005 levels by 2025--ensures that clean energy will get a major boost in the United States, meaning more jobs and less pollution at home. One big step toward that goal is EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan, which will limit carbon pollution from its largest source, the power sector--a policy supported by two-thirds of the American people. But in both China and the United States, further reductions and a deeper level of ambition will be needed. 2. Emissions in the industrialized world are trending downward. My second reason for optimism is that we're seeing results now: In both the United States and Europe, greenhouse gas emissions have been dropping. From 2005 to 2012, the EU reduced carbon dioxide emissions by about 13%. And in the United States, we have cut emissions by about 10% over that time. There have been upticks in the last two years, which we should not ignore, but the overall trend is clear: our economies are demonstrating that they can grow and decarbonize at the same time. Most of these reductions were due to the replacement of coal with natural gas, energy efficiency and the growth of renewables. 3. The clean energy future is now. The price of solar panels has been cut 80% since 2008, and the United States added more solar capacity in the past two years than in the previous 30 years combined. Texas and Kansas are showing what is possible with wind power. (At one point last year, wind generated nearly 40% of Texas' electricity.) Electric vehicles have become trendy. In Nevada, Tesla is building the world's largest advanced automotive-battery factory. In New York,  Solar City is building a massive solar-photovoltaic factory. Market leaders like Google and Walmart are making huge investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency. And America is poised to invest $2 trillion over the next 20 years in the electric grid. With the right policies, this could transform the way the nation creates, conducts and consumes power. 4. We're taking action on methane. My optimism goes beyond carbon. Methane is 84 times more dangerous to our climate than carbon dioxide over a couple of decades, and the oil and gas industry may be emitting more of it than we thought. Methane accounts for one-quarter of the warming we are now experiencing. If that doesn't sound like a reason for optimism, then think of it like this: Here's a major contributor to climate change that we can reduce at bargain prices. A recent report found that we could cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by 40% with technology that exists today. The cost? A penny, on average. That's right: We can stop almost half of methane leakage from industry, and the cost of a thousand cubic feet of natural gas would inch up from $3.95 to $3.96. 5. The kids are alright. Finally, the demographics are on our side. Younger voters overwhelmingly support climate action, as do important voting constituencies such as African Americans and Latinos. Eighty-five percent of people under 30 support limits on carbon pollution from power plants. It doesn't take a political strategist, or an actuary, to understand that these people will be voting for far longer than those over 65--the least supportive cohort. For all of these positive signs, we are  still in the race of our lives with a very long way to go. SO WHAT'S THE PLAN? To assess what needs to be done by EDF and many others, we spent more than a year talking to allies and experts from academia and industry. Through that process, we arrived at some principles that led to a plan of action. First, we determined that an ambitious goal is achievable: We can turn the corner toward climate stability by 2020. That means stopping once and for all the centuries-old rise in total greenhouse gas emissions, and seeing those emissions peak, level off and begin to decline. This can happen in the next five years--if countries devote sufficient attention to the task. And it can be done with current technology and at reasonable cost. For the United States, turning the corner means imposing a strict limit on carbon pollution from power plants and making sure the billions that will soon be invested in the nation's electric grid are invested wisely. For China, it means the nation must, by 2020, cap half of its carbon emissions at 2015 levels, improve energy efficiency by 25%, and shift its energy mix to one-third renewable energy, natural gas and nuclear. EDF is helping China achieve these goals. We also must cut emissions of shortlived climate pollutants--including methane, HFCs (used in some air conditioning) and black carbon--which cause about a third of current warming. EDF is focused on reducing methane leaks. Just a few years ago, almost no one was talking about methane's potential to disrupt the climate. Now we're starting to make genuine progress. Next, we need to halt deforestation. The destruction of the world's forests is responsible for about 15% of the world's carbon emissions--and the clearing will continue until we make forests like the Amazon more valuable alive than dead. One key strategy is to reward forest protection in a global carbon marketplace. Already, there are encouraging signs: Brazil has reduced its Amazon deforestation rate by 70% over the past decade. Finally, we learned that the biggest emitters will largely determine the outcome. A global solution is necessary, but what happens in China, the United States and Europe will have the most impact by far. So that's where EDF is focused.  For the United States, turning the corner means imposing a strict limit on carbon pollution from power plants and making sure the billions of dollars that will soon be invested in the nation's electric grid are invested wisely.  For long-lasting change, we need to address the market failure that caused this problem in the first place: with our allies, we need to change the game, so those who produce the pollution pay the social cost, creating an incentive for a worldwide market correction toward clean energy. It's Economics 101--when it costs nothing to pollute, you get a lot of pollution. But when there's a price to pay, industry will have a bottom line incentive to find low-carbon solutions. Making climate pollution a cost of doing business is the path that many governments are already taking--from Brussels to Beijing to Sacramento. And this is the path that the United States must take, too. Which leads to the final imperative: American politics. The President and EPA have used many--though not all--of the options they have under existing law to cut carbon pollution. These groundbreaking actions are critical, but we cannot solve the climate crisis without Congress. We must find creative ways to engage conservative voters, opinion leaders and elected officials who want to get on the right side of history. For 2016, we must demand that every  presidential candidate propose real climate solutions. No serious presidential contender can ignore this pressing threat to our economy and way of life. That applies to Congress as well. At present, comprehensive climate legislation seems beyond America's reach. Many in the new Congress are focused on tearing down EPA's climate protections. I believe this is a political mistake that younger voters in particular will not tolerate. A rapidly growing database of such voters is sure to become a potent weapon in future elections. In recent months, 3.7 million people, many of them young, voiced support for EPA's Clean Power Plan. More than 480,000 were EDF members and supporters. I believe the political stalemate on climate won't last, because I know there are serious leaders on both sides of the aisle who recognize the need to protect this nation from climate change. There are so many reasons for optimism: The price of renewables is dropping; the major emitters are taking action; young voters are fully on board. And the swing toward a clean energy future is fully in motion. Can we stop climate change in time? It's not just possible--it's more than likely, if we continue to fight.  How you can help Stopping global warming will require help from everyone, not just decision makers and elected officials. Here are five actions you can take that will reduce emissions: 1 Make your home more energy efficient. Contact your local utility. Get an energy audit of your home and follow the recommendations-- adding insulation or plugging leaks, for example. Many utilities and states perform these audits for free. 2 Reduce, reuse and recycle. Recycling just one aluminum can save enough energy to power a desktop computer for four hours. 3 The next time you buy a car or truck, buy one that gets better gas mileage than your present vehicle. Also, walk, bike, carpool or use public transportation whenever possible. 4 Wash clothes in cold or warm water, not hot. And don't use heat to dry dishes in your dishwasher. 5 Sign up for EDF's action alerts () and stay engaged politically at the federal, state and local levels. Citizen input is vitally important to ensure that decisions about power generation and transportation result in lower emissions.   Reviving fisheries around  The world's most severe overfishing occurs outside U.S. waters, so international engagement is essential. Our aim is to work with governments and local fishermen to make sustainable fishing the norm in countries that account for nearly two-thirds of the global catch..  3 billion people rely on fish as an important source of protein.  SAVING THE SEA'S GREAT PREDATORS EDF is working with Cuban scientists and fishermen to conduct the first in-depth survey of sharks in Cuba's waters. The research will reveal special places that warrant protection and will inform Cuba's national plan of action for sharks. EDF is a key advisor to Cuban officials on how to safeguard these majestic creatures. The plan could also be a model for managing other threatened migratory species such as tuna.  EU: ENGAGING THE BIG PLAYERS Europe's fisheries are in the worst condition of any in the developed world, with 75% overfished. EDF advised officials of the European Union as they rewrote its fisheries law in 2013, committing Europe to end overfishing by 2020. And in 2014, the EU Parliament passed legislation to fund tools that will support communities making the transition to sustainable fishing. We're also working with fishermen in Spain, Sweden and the UK to improve the economic and ecological performance of fisheries.   the world  40% of global fisheries are in deep trouble  35 million people make their living in small-scale fisheries  FISH FOREVER Nearly half the fish that people eat are caught in nearshore fisheries, many of which are unmanaged. EDF has partnered with UC-Santa Barbara and Rare, a global leader in community-led conservation, to provide artisanal fishermen in the developing world with practical solutions to reverse overfishing. Our collaboration, called Fish Forever, is engaged in the Philippines and Indonesia as well as Belize, Brazil and Mozambique.  ``The best way to revive oceans is to empower fishermen with rights, '' responsibilities and rewards. Dr. Laura Rodriguez, Oceans deputy director, EDF de México  PRESERVING A WAY OF LIFE IN MEXICO'S GULF OF CALIFORNIA On the first day of Lent, under a full moon, traditional fishermen head out in the Gulf of California to fish for curvina, a salmon-sized fish native to the area. It's a decades-old ritual that sustains local communities. The fishery is as large as the U.S. red snapper fishery, but overfishing has caused a perennial glut in supply, crashing prices and putting the survival of the species at risk. Historically, fishermen would land thousands of tons in just a few days. EDF teamed up with regional organizations to create a catch share program for curvina. By bringing together fishermen, government officials and buyers, the community developed an agreement in which each skiff was granted a per-tide allocation for fish. The result? Fishermen are earning 23% more per pound of fish, and the catch is distributed across the entire season. Catch shares have also reduced the total catch by half, ensuring the longterm health of the population. EDF has now been asked by the hake industry to protect their fishery as well, and the Mexican government is also consulting with us as it considers catch shares nationwide.   EDF ONLINE  Of droughts and downpours  IIissa Ocko is a climate scientist who studies Earth's energy balance and is passionate about  What on Earth is going on when New York gets endless rain and California barely any; when one part of the country is freezing  communicating science to a lay audience.  while another suffers record heat? Scientists have now tied extreme  weather such as California's  drought to climate change. Rising temperatures also create extreme contrasts.  Here's how:  Rain patterns are changing: In the Northeast, more moisture in the atmosphere and changing circulation patterns are bringing more rain. In the Southwest, high pressure systems are suppressing rainfall. Experts suggest that some of these systems are more likely to occur with climate change. As global temperatures rise, more evaporation has led to more moisture in the atmosphere, and this has contributed to more intense rainfall. Even the drought-stricken West is getting more heavy downpours when it does rain.  Droughts take hold: In the Southwest, the drop in rainfall brings drier conditions that magnify drought. As the soil dries out, sunlight heats the ground instead of evaporating water from the soil, creating a vicious cycle.  Flooding in the Northeast: Because soil moisture is increasing there, flooding events in the Northeast are on the rise. A one-foot rise in sea levels since the 1900s contributes to flooding. Unless we reduce climate pollution, these trends will worsen. The Clean Power Plan, which sets the first national limits on climate pollution from power plants, is a vital step toward climate stability.  EDF looks ahead  Imagine a future  where clear skies re-  place choking smog  in China's cities,  where the Amazon's  magnificent rainfor-  ests are worth more  alive than dead and  where global cli-  mate pollution is  sharply reduced.  EDF STRATEGIC PLAN 2015­2019  The world's oceans  once again abound  in fish, farmers feed a growing world while  polluting less, wildlife thrives on working  lands and more people enjoy good health  with less exposure to toxic chemicals.  This is the world EDF envisions and works every day to build. How do we get there? No organization alone can do all that is needed to address today's environmental problems. But by working in partnership with others, we can make a difference. The sustained efforts of many groups working together have won important advances for the environment, but we need to remain vigilant to defend and build upon these gains in the years ahead.  Since the 1990s, EDF has relied on a series of five-year strategic plans to map out what needs to be done to protect climate, oceans, ecosystems and health. We look at how EDF is best positioned to help meet the most pressing challenges, based on our strengths and the good work others are doing.  Our vision for 2015­2019 is captured in Blueprint 2020, the most ambitious strategic plan that EDF has ever developed, because today's complex challenges require nothing less. Please join us in building a better future. Money down the drain Water leaks waste billions of gallons of water and countless dollars every year. EDF's Kate Zerrenner explains how smart water meters save you water and money.   Blown away by wind power On a trip to Denmark, EDF membership director Sam Parry reflects on a society racing toward a clean energy future. Can the U.S. emulate Denmark? he asks.   CORBIS  Civic and religious leaders, economists and CEOs speak up for the environment on our behalf.  Our political advocacy partner is 100% focused on delivering bipartisan solutions to environmental problems.  In may 2014, the future looked bleak for the nation's best tool to reverse the decline of the oceans. Rep. Steve Southerland (R-FL) had tucked a rider into a must-pass appropriations bill that would have banned new catch share programs in the United States, which have proven to be successful in reviving fisheries. Three years ago, a similar rider had easily passed in the House. Not this time. In a stunning victory, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 223­185 to defeat the appropriations rider. The turnaround was no accident, but the result of a campaign by EDF Action, the political advocacy partner of Environmental Defense Fund. EDF Action is free to do things that EDF could not do, including unlimited lobbying of Congress, and it does this by raising dollars that are not tax deductible. Our strategy included cultivating GOP champions, generating positive media coverage and bringing fishermen to Washington to make their case. Perhaps most notable was the conversion by Gulf Coast Republicans--the entire Alabama and Mississippi delegations voted with us. (Rep. Southerland was voted out of office in November.) This was just one of EDF Action's victories in 2014. For Climate, it helped defeat efforts to undermine EPA's Clean  Power Plan and stepped in to defend Republicans in Kansas who were protecting the state's strong renewable energy standards. For Health, it helped advance reform of the nation's chemicals policy. And for Ecosystems, it secured funding for wetlands protection. Lasting environmental solutions result from having everyone pitch in, regardless of their political views. This has never been truer than today, with the White House and Congress controlled by different parties. Removing political barriers ""It's critical to depolarize environmental issues,"" says Elizabeth Thompson, president of EDF Action. ""That's why we engage with the political system on both sides of the aisle."" Our Strategic Partners, a network of influential supporters around the country, are helping deliver EDF's message. These allies, including civic and religious leaders and CEOs, contact legislators personally. Calls from Action Fund members turn up the pressure. ""We have our work cut out for us in 2015,"" says Thompson. ""There are sure to be furious attempts to thwart EPA. But it would be a mistake for anyone to conclude that the 2014 election signals that the public wants congressional rollbacks  of environmental protections."" A recent national poll, for instance, found that seven in ten Americans view climate change as a serious problem and support federal action to cut carbon pollution. In fact, the election puts new pressure on Congress to find a more constructive approach on the environment. EDF Action is using cutting-edge analytics to help politicians understand voter attitudes. ""Their constituencies are moving--and they've got catching up to do,"" says Thompson. ""We can't match the lobbyists dollar for dollar,"" she adds, ""but lawmakers listen to their supporters, and many supporters care about the environment. We're helping amplify their voices."" ""We're on the front lines,"" says Thompson.   Agriculture: Conservation's new frontier By Peter Klebnikov  Fertilizer use and soil management are responsible for half of the global warming caused by agriculture.  If we are going to sustainably feed nine billion people in 2050, we must produce more without further contaminating water supplies and disrupting the climate. For EDF, the place to start is fertilizer pollution in the heartland.  In the summer of 2014, a half million residents of toledo, oh, woke up to find their tap water unfit to drink. The cause? Poisonous cyanobacteria created by excess farm fertilizer polluting Lake Erie and other waters. With lakes, reservoirs, estuaries and coastal waters around the country registering a rise of fertilizer-driven algae blooms, the same crisis could easily unfold in many American cities. Traditionally, farmers are careful stewards of the land. But when producing food threatens to deprive us of clean water and a stable climate, it's time to rethink the way we feed America. ""Used inefficiently, fertilizer is a major threat to both clean water and climate,"" says EDF agriculture sustainability director Suzy Friedman. ""Fertilizer not absorbed by the plant is lost to air and water, damaging the environment."" That, in part, is why places like the Gulf of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay and Lake Erie are plagued by huge dead zones. EDF has partnered with farmers for  years to cut fertilizer loss, advancing techniques to improve the rate and timing of nutrients and promoting natural filters such as wetlands to keep fertilizer out of streams. As a result, farms covering half a million acres, mostly in the Midwest, have cut fertilizer loss by an average of 25%--all while maintaining yields. But with the environmental costs of agriculture rising, EDF is pushing for broader adoption of these practices. The most effective way to do this is to harness every player in the U.S. grain supply chain--from retailer down to the farmer. First, we helped secure a commitment from Walmart to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its supply chain by 20 million metric tons by 2015. Fertilizer not absorbed by crops can form nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Agriculture now contributes 8% of the nation's global warming emissions. To help meet its goal, Walmart is requiring its biggest food suppliers to create fertilizer efficiency plans for their own  supply chains. Several of these food companies, including Smithfield, the world's largest pork producer, Campbell's Soup and General Mills, asked EDF to help them cut fertilizer loss. By 2014, 15 major Walmart suppliers, representing 30% of North American food and beverage sales, began to implement fertilizer efficiency plans. The Walmart effort will engage the entire supply chain, including the grain buyers and agribusinesses who work directly with farmers on crop management. Voices from the field Growing public pressure for sustainable agriculture is helping drive change and gives EDF clout in making conservation an integral part of agriculture. But to succeed, the initiative requires buy-in on the farm. To help farmers change long-held practices, EDF partnered with United Suppliers (USI), a wholesale agriculture supply company, to create a fertilizer efficiency and soil health program that the company will implement through its owners, who advise grain farmers managing 45 million acres. USI committed to enrolling 10 million acres in the program over the next six years. ""When I heard there was to be a meeting with EDF, I said `Oh no, this is not  going to be good,'"" recalls Matt Carstens, USI's vice president. ""Instead, EDF reached out a hand and said `Let's work together.' It quickly became clear that we all want the same thing--to keep fertilizer out of the waterways. So we dropped our weapons."" The focus is on corn, the biggest source of excess fertilizer. Our goal is to maximize fertilizer efficiency on 50% of U.S. corn acres by 2020. Historically, farmers never knew exactly how much fertilizer to use, so they often applied too much out of fear of losing yield. Friedman and her colleagues put in years  visiting farms, getting to know heartland farmers, and consulting with crop associations and other groups. That led to a series of field trials of methods to improve soil health and help farmers apply fertilizer at the right time in the growing season. ""EDF put it all together,"" says USI's Carstens. ""They had the market penetration. They worked on every aspect of the project, from developing the tools to education to accountability. They've been an outstanding partner that's consistently moved the project forward."" Farmers turned out to be willing allies, recognizing that by reducing fertilizer loss, they save money and improve the health of their farm for future generations. ""Our growers are beginning to understand the need to build resilience into natural systems,"" says Carstens. ""With so many floods around the Midwest in recent years, no one knows what is normal anymore."" ""Most farmers want to be good stewards,"" adds EDF's Karen Chapman. ""They're open to new ideas once they see the results on their farm."" It's also about the bottom line. Fertilizer accounts for at least half of farmers' input costs, and current techniques generate losses of about 50% of nutrients applied. With  better practices, this can drop to as low as 25%. ""There's no doubt in my mind that with this project we'll substantially reduce fertilizer as a pollutant in American agriculture,"" says  Carstens. ""At the end of the day, we want to make sure that we in agriculture have done our part to deal with global warming. Our partnership with EDF gives us a platform to do that.""

EJF strives to: ·Protect the natural environment and the people and wildlife that depend upon it by linking environmental security, human rights and social need. ·Create and implement solutions where they are needed most ­ training local people and communities who are directly affected to investigate, expose and combat environmental degradation and associated human rights abuses. ·Provide training in the latest video technologies, research and advocacy skills to document both the problems and solutions, working through the media to create public and political platforms for constructive change. ·Raise international awareness of the issues our partners are working locally to resolve. Climate change is creating millions of climate refugees ­ people forced from their homes and land ­ by rising temperatures, sea-level change and extreme weather events. Many are among our planet's poorest and most vulnerable people. These are the first victims of our failure to prevent climate change: people who, without international help and new binding agreements on assistance, have nowhere to go and no means to survive. EJF is dedicated to arguing their case: putting the call to governments and our political leaders for a new agreement on climate refugees, guaranteeing them rights, assistance and a fair claim to our shared world. EJF is also committed to empowering individuals and organisations to take positive actions to reduce their impact on the natural environment; encouraging them to act now, before the irreversible effects of climate change take hold.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  · In 2013, the World Bank warned that 4°C of warming by the end of the century is a real and urgent risk.1 According to an influential study published the same year, such a rise in global temperature could precipitate as much as a 56 per cent increase in the frequency of intergroup conflicts across the world.2 Once only considered as an `environmental issue', climate change is an emerging concern on international security agendas. It is seen as a threat to both human and national security. This reframing has seen climate change discussed in two high-profile debates in the United Nations Security Council and become the subject of United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolution . · This report finds that while climate change may not be the sole cause of conflict in the future, it will increasingly become one of the most important and decisive factors. It will play a prominent role as a `threat multiplier' ­ in situations where multiple stressors already exist, climate change may breach critical thresholds that lead to outbreaks of conflict. This is particularly true in situations where climate change impacts actual or perceived resource scarcity, patterns of human migration or unfolds within contexts of existing state fragility. In some cases, such as vulnerable small island nations, climate change threatens the integrity and sovereignty of the state itself. · One of the most pronounced links between climate change and conflict is access to natural resources. Many lessdeveloped countries are acutely dependent on ecosystem services and already experience tensions related to the uneven distribution of resources and services both within and across countries. Climate change may exacerbate resourcerelated insecurities and generate conflict by increasing the likelihood that actors resort to coercion or violence. · Unequal access to resources fuels tensions within societies, particularly where there is a history of specific groups being marginalised. Climate change will likely entrench or expand unequal systems of entitlement that alienate vulnerable populations. · Freshwater availability is a significant contributing factor to stability. The relative scarcity of water between areas is an existing fault line driving economic and political tensions amongst some states. Failure to cooperate over water resources which straddle international boundaries is likely to exacerbate pre-existing pressures in geopolitical hotspots, with repercussions for regional stability and foreign policy objectives. · Inadequate access to water also drives tensions. Obstructed access to water has historically been used to undermine particular regions or populations within countries. A waterscarce future, driven by overexploitation and exacerbated by rainfall variability, may witness the increasingly strategic use of water as leverage ­ or even as a weapon ­ in situations of conflict.  · In 2012, one person every second was displaced by a climate- or weather-related natural disaster.3 This report finds that, with millions of people displaced each year by rapid-onset climate-related hazards and an unknown number fleeing slow-onset environmental degradation, a changing climate presents pressing operational and geopolitical challenges to a number of states. Failure to adequately respond to these challenges generates types of population mobility which have severe implications for social wellbeing, human rights and even state stability. · This report demonstrates that fragile and post-conflict states are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Pre-existing constellations of vulnerability in these contexts may lead to `tipping points' where the influence of climate change on other drivers of instability spills over into crisis and conflict. · The destabilising effect of climate change on fragile states could also aggravate or generate instability on an international scale by transmitting risk across borders. US military experts, for instance, consistently raise concerns that a failure to address the impacts of climate change in some regions might generate `ungoverned spaces' ­ where the capacity of states to maintain security is fundamentally compromised ­ and provide fertile breeding grounds for armed non-state actors.4 · EJF acknowledges the commitments made by the global community to mitigation and adaptation under the Copenhagen Accord. Nevertheless, further and urgent action is needed to ensure the prevention of conflicts related to climate change. In particular, EJF urges governments to deliver `linked-up' policies on the environment, human rights, development, migration and peacebuilding. EJF recalls the findings of the Stern Review, which highlighted that investment in climate mitigation equivalent to 2 per cent of global GDP is preferable to the huge future costs to economic productivity anticipated as a result of climate change. Similarly, EJF emphasises that investment in mitigation now is also investment in a safer and more secure future for vulnerable people across the world. · The international community must recognise that climate change is a human rights issue as much as an environmental issue. The linkage between climate change and conflict is one of the clearest examples of this fundamental interrelationship between the environment and human rights. EJF urges the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to take positive action to safeguard rights under threat in the world's most vulnerable countries by instating a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change.   INTRODUCTION  As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report reiterates, the environmental impacts of anthropogenic climate change are becoming increasingly apparent.7 Each recent decade is warmer than all those proceeding it since 1850, ice is now melting at a rate six times faster than during the 1990s and rainfall patterns are becoming increasingly erratic. Large swathes of agricultural land and crucial sources of freshwater are being contaminated by saltwater intrusion. Sea-levels are rising, warming and becoming more acidic ­ transforming the coastal and marine ecosystems which constitute some of the world's most productive regions. At the same time, some extreme weather events such as droughts are becoming more intense and frequent.8 Over the next century, catastrophic levels of global environmental change are within a defined realm of possibility.9 As these changes unfold, they amplify existing environmental, social, economic and political pressures. The result has been, and will continue to be, tangible and severe human impacts: declining agricultural productivity and food insecurity, the collapse of livelihoods, increased poverty and hunger, deteriorating water security, public health crises, loss of assets and lives at risk. Many of these impacts obstruct processes of development and undermine the viability of national and international governance systems. Consequently, climate change both directly and indirectly threatens the effective realisation of human rights. In 2014, the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report section on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability featured, for the first time, chapters dedicated to the security implications of climate change.14 It concludes that climate change will generate new challenges to states and will ""increasingly shape both conditions of security and national security policies."" In particular, it finds that: slow- and rapidonset environmental changes have significant impacts on forms of migration that compromise human security; that climate change negatively affects many of the factors that increase the risk of civil war and other armed conflicts; that climate impacts will create contested claims to resources, particularly transboundary water basins, causing geopolitical rivalry; and that climate change will affect the capacity, integrity and in some cases the viability of states. climate security, resources, water, extreme weather, displacement, scarcity, violence, instability, mitigation, human rights, cooperation, risk, adaptation, crisis  I frequently find myself watching my grandchildren and wondering what sort of a future we are leaving them. For their sake, climate change is an issue that I will continue to talk about for as long as I have breath in my body. President Tong of Kiribati at the United Nations General Assembly15 The impacts of climate change are being felt most acutely in arid, mountainous and low-lying coastal regions of less-developed countries where exposure to rapid-onset hazards and slow-onset changes are the most pronounced, sensitivity is high and there is limited capacity to adapt. These regions and countries are home to 98 per cent of the seriously affected people, over 90 per cent of the total economic losses and 99 per cent of all deaths from climate- and weather-related disasters alone.16 In short, it is the world's poorest who are first and worst affected by climate change ­ as a 2013 report from the World Bank reiterates.17 Perversely, many of these countries have the lowest cumulative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on record. Industrialised countries have historically emitted over three-quarters of all global carbon dioxide.18 The country with the least emissions, Kiribati, has emitted a mere 0.0007 per cent of the United States's GHGs during the two decades 1990-2010 ­ yet the impacts of climate change threaten its existence as a state.19 Such facts serve as a reminder that the transformation of our global environment is inherently linked to issues of climate justice: equity, responsibility and collective rights. When Yoweri Museveni, President of Uganda, declared climate change to be an ""act of aggression"" perpetrated by the rich against the poor it proved a divisive statement.20 Although polemic, his statement indicates conflict as an important interface between the environment and human rights and reflects the increasingly prominent framing of climate change as a security threat. `Climate security' has brought environmentalists and militaries across the world into a unique accord: both are concerned by the effects that climate change does and will have on existing situations of insecurity. For military forces, who are often deployed to the frontlines of natural disasters and are usually the leaders of national and international peacekeeping efforts, the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between climate change, security and conflict warrants urgent international attention.    Cyclone Nargis displaced 800,000 and caused an estimated $4 billion worth of damage. Underdeveloped, fragile countries like Myanmar are the first and worst affected by climate change. © UNICEF/Adam Dean  Sticking your head in the sand might make you feel safer, but it's not going to protect you from the coming storm. US President Barack Obama21 This report is one of a series by EJF that explores why there is an urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts embedded within a framework that recognises climate change as both a human rights issue and an environmental issue. In it, EJF examines the extent to which institutions committed to safeguarding human and national security are incorporating climate change as an important factor into their analyses. This report argues that climate change can and does undermine human security and that it also contributes to intra- and inter-state insecurity. Using country case studies, it considers some of the ways through which climate change may cause instability and how these may contribute to the generation or escalation of conflict at local, national and international levels. It stresses that the rapid incorporation of climate change into global security agendas indicates high-level  support for the urgent prioritisation of climate change as an international issue affecting individual and collective wellbeing, security and human rights. Finally, this report underscores the significant human, economic, social and environmental costs that will be incurred as a result of our continued collective failure to mitigate climate change. In 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern stressed that mitigation ""must be viewed as an investment, to avoid the risks of very severe consequences in the future.""22 A recent report from DARA and the Climate Vulnerable Forum calculates that, together, climate change and our carbon-intensive economy annually result in 4.9 million deaths and net reductions in world output equal to 1.6 per cent of GDP (or US$1.2 trillion).23 Accounting for these negative externalities, they estimate that decadal investments in mitigation measures equal to 0.5-1.5 per cent of global GDP would result in net returns of 1 per cent through to 2100. EJF are in agreement with a 2013 letter to Congress from leading US security experts, which notes that investment in mitigation now is an investment in saved lives, prevented conflicts and greater wellbeing in the future.24 Governments must begin to deliver policies that explicitly address the linkages between environmental sustainability, human rights, migration, development and conflict prevention. At the international level, EJF urges the UNHRC to instate a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change based on the fact that the principal barrier to a comprehensive realisation of the true costs of climate change lies in the international community's reluctance to view climate change as a human rights issue as much as an environmental issue.   A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT  Climate change poses a major threat to both human and national security. The UK government has described climate change as potentially constituting the ""greatest challenge to global stability and security, and therefore to national security"".25 A 2013 report from the American Security Project highlights that 71 per cent of countries view climate change as a key national security issue whilst the world's top military spenders ­ with the notable exception of China ­ have begun to develop new strategic approaches to addressing the impacts of climate change. These countries include the UK, the US, Russia, Japan, France and Germany.// Changing perceptions are motivating important international actors to debate climate change as a security issue. In 2013, at the 68th Session of the UNGA, European Union priorities include pursuing ""climate diplomacy for conflict prevention"".34 Climate security has similarly been the subject of several debates within the UN Security Council as well as a UNGA resolution. In 2009, an alliance of Pacific island states successfully tabled resolution , `Climate change and its possible security implications', in the General Assembly.35 It urged the UN and its bodies to intensify efforts to address the security challenges of climate change and asked the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report at the next session. This was an historic moment, as it was the first resolution that the Pacific coalition had drafted and the first time Member States agreed, by consensus, on the link between climate change and security. It reaffirmed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the central, guiding framework for all coordinated action on climate change, but added that primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rested with the Security Council.36 Despite this affirmation, the extent to which the Security Council has a mandate to discuss or act on climate change has provoked heated debates. Whilst tentatively recognising that climate change `could' affect security, China ­ backed by Russia as well as several other emerging economies and less-developed countries ­ has argued that the Council is not the appropriate forum to discuss climate change.37 In 2013, a Security Council session addressing climate change was conducted informally as a result of pressure from China and Russia.38 Smaller states meanwhile argue that the deleterious and life-threatening effects of climate change are at the very least comparable to the impact of warfare. An alliance of small island states has called on Council members to express solidarity with vulnerable countries by ""formally recognizing that climate change is a threat to international peace and security"".The question of whether the UN Security Council should have any involvement in climate change is hotly contested amongst the international community. © UNGermany  The small island states have been supported by countries from the EU as well as the US and Japan, who have noted that although the anticipated timeframe for responding to climate change is different from that for armed conflict, climate change does have indirect adverse effects on security that must be addressed. They underscore the particular threat of rising seas to small island states, as well as the potential for dispute over territorial waters and the increased vulnerability of coastal areas to natural hazards, arguing that where instability occurs there is a heightened risk of conflict.40 Consequently, many states support the contention that, as it falls within the Security Council's mandate to prevent conflicts, it is the duty of the Council to consider appropriate courses of action in response to the impacts of climate change.The pressures caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world. These effects are threat multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, and social tensions.  Understanding Environmental Security  Security as a concept is often interpreted in two different ways. It can refer to national or state security, which generally emphasises a military perspective, or it can relate to human security, which sees individual people as the subject of security studies. Climate change and the environment have long been looked at from both perspectives. EJF acknowledges the ongoing academic debate concerning the nature and scope of environmental security as a concept. Nevertheless, the idea that climate change has human and national security implications has become embedded within the policy discourses of many countries. Influential strategic policy documents which reference climate change, such as the US Department of Defense's 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, can translate into potentially dramatic shifts in the way national resources are allocated ­ as the Department's 2013 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap and a 2013 Executive Order from President Obama demonstrate./47 Consequently, this report responds to the need to address the accelerating sense of urgency with which many security institutions regard the issue of climate change and how they interpret its implications for human, national and global security. Some commentators note that the increasing attention which security institutions, particularly the military, afford climate change may result in undesirable outcomes./50 Concerns tend to address the fact that militaries themselves have significant negative environmental impacts and substantial GHG emissions and question whether military and security institutions are suited to addressing the underlying social and economic factors driving climate change. They also highlight the opportunity costs associated with funding military expenditure versus direct climate change mitigation. Framing matters in national security terms may not necessarily always facilitate progressive change: invoking `threats beyond borders' ignores the role of domestic policy in creating climate insecurity and `securitised' discourse can just as easily translate into crusades for energy independence as calls for multilateral emissions reductions. EJF does not view any future militarised response to climate change as a positive or productive development. It does, however, recognise that failure to sufficiently engage with climate change as a security issue now may necessitate the involvement of the world's militaries in future situations of conflict driven by climate change.   AN EMERGENT THREAT TO SECURITY  Climate change is of increasing interest to security institutions ­ both state (military, intelligence agencies, etc) and non-state (think-tanks, policy research groups, private analysts, etc). In 2004, when chief scientific advisor to the UK government, Sir David King, warned that climate change posed a greater threat than terrorism, US President George W. Bush demanded that he be gagged.51 Less than a decade later, a stream of publications from high-profile US security institutions has directly challenged the political atmosphere of climate change scepticism in the US and has brought leading security analysts into conflict with members of Congress.///58 In many countries, the acknowledgement of climate change as a security issue is linked to the recognition that an increasingly globalised world presents new and complex challenges such as the reliable supply of energy, the stability of international economic markets and the prevalence of terrorism and transnational crime. Understanding climate change as both a human rights and an environmental issue highlights not only the interconnectedness of security threats and risk but also the interdependence of nation states in the post-Cold War security landscape. In an increasingly integrated global system, contagion spreads with unprecedented speed and scale, as the 2008 financial crisis and H1N1 flu pandemic evidence. Climate change may well open avenues for local insecurities to act upon the international stage: human and national security have therefore become issues with international scope. At the highest levels of government, the crossover between security and climate change is becoming increasingly apparent: in 2013, former Commander of the UK's Maritime Forces, Rear Admiral Neil Morisetti, was appointed as Special Representative for Climate Change, or the country's `international climate ambassador'.61 Military analysts, intelligence advisors and policymakers in strategic and security circles are all actively engaging with climate change as a security issue. Academic scholarship meanwhile continues to explore and untangle the complex pathways linking environmental change and conflict, with considerable disagreement amongst scholars over the same issues: lively debate exists, for example, as to whether climate change exacerbates the risk of civil war in Africa or is a poor predictor of conflict. A 2013 study incorporating psychological and historical data into a synthesis of quantitative research addressing the influence of climatic variables on conflict, worryingly concludes that by 2050 instances of interpersonal violence and intergroup conflict will increase by between 8-16 and 28-56 per cent respectively.64 There is considerable variation to the ways in which security institutions are engaging with climate security. Militaries are becoming increasingly concerned with the operational challenges climate change presents. Whilst the US Navy Seals and the Army have their sights set on becoming carbon-neutral, recent US Department of Defense policy is targeting climate change adaptation as a cornerstone of operational success.  We recognise climate change as a contributing factor in increased economic and security risks globally. The G8 has agreed to consider means to better respond to this challenge and its associated risks, recalling that international climate policy and sustainable economic development are mutually reinforcing. Lough Erne G8 Leaders Communique67 Tackling climate change urgently, through mitigation and adaptation measures, is not only an environmental imperative but also, fundamentally, a necessary condition for peace and security, development and prosperity. Council of the European Union68 ...whether you're from Australia or Bangladesh, South Africa or Japan, your presence here today speaks to the seriousness of the climate security agenda. For governments, the risks are clear: to development, to democracy, and to peace itself. We cannot afford to ignore them. UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey From the US to Bangladesh, governments are positioning their armed forces as essential components of national response mechanisms to the periods before, during and after climate change-related disasters. At the other end of the spectrum, security institutions dedicate considerable resources to investigating the strategic, geopolitical implications of climate change. Whilst such implications are obviously uncertain, security as a discipline is largely focused on the assessment and management of risk. Therefore security institutions, much like climate scientists, are concerned with the full range of potentialities ­ rather than discarding some as implausible and thus irrelevant. In the broadest sense, this means looking at climate change as a `threat multiplier' or a vector for the transmission of risk in existing situations of instability.72 Climate change is often described as a threat multiplier, a way of implying that it is akin to an aggravator of the underlying social, economic, demographic, political and environmental causes of conflict.73 It amplifies both existing and emergent pressures ­ such as high population growth, resource scarcity, poverty and poor governance ­ and can create tipping points whereby states are `pushed' over critical thresholds and erupt into instability and conflict . This kind of logic is already apparent in analyses of many climate-vulnerable countries ­ the International Organization for Migration, for example, identifies the risk of a destabilising `cascade effect' in Bangladesh resulting from the influence of climate change on environmental degradation, urbanisation, human insecurity and migration.74 The complexity of the climate system itself presents novel security challenges, which both policymakers and analysts risk overlooking should they fail to appreciate the security implications of climate change. In 2010, for instance, the devastating floods in Pakistan ­ which left 1.5 million displaced and consolidated the Taliban's hold on Balochistan, the Sind plains and Khyber Pakhtoonwa ­ were caused by the same meteorological event which precipitated the worst Russian drought in half a century and wildfires which wiped out an estimated 30 million tonnes of grain production./77 Emerging research is beginning to suggest that the intensity and duration of these kinds of extreme weather events ­ blocking abnormalities in atmospheric jet streams ­ may be linked to both natural and human factors, such as Arctic ice loss, resulting from anthropogenic climate change./80 Whilst the global spate of record-breaking extreme weather in the first quarter of 2014 prompted the World Meteorological Organization to declare that such events are fundamentally interlinked, top science advisors in the UK and US have cautiously attributed such extreme weather events to climatic change./83 As mentioned, the interconnectedness of modern economic, political, social and cultural systems allows for the effective and rapid transmission of global `pathogens' or crises ­ the international trade in illicit narcotics, for instance, already demonstrates how, under the right conditions, market forces alone transmit instability and violence across producer, transit and consumer countries.84 Framing climate change as a security issue provides a valuable way of linking together the various challenges posed by climate change across multiple scales ­ from the household and individual levels up to the regional and international. By exposing interrelated threats to scrutiny,  Hurricane Sandy demonstrated that no country is immune to the destruction wrought by extreme weather events. © Scott Whiting this process of `linking-up' enables a wider dialogue between governments, militaries, donors and civil society that feeds back into policy processes on development, human rights, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. It also provides much-needed information regarding how stakeholders can work collaboratively on conflict prevention and governance-building activities.85 Understanding the complex relationship between climate change and conflict is a crucial part of planning and preparing for the impacts of climate change. It is also of particular benefit to many stakeholders because it constitutes the foundations of policymakers' ability to employ detailed analyses for the identification of specific regions and dynamics that may be destabilised by climate change. Some climate security analysts seek to identify coherent future scenarios in which environmental stressors might reasonably be expected to generate or exacerbate conflict. Several institutions have plotted potential and emerging conflict `hotspots', and there is general agreement that the risks of climate-related insecurity are concentrated in Africa and Asia ­ which climate change models also indicate are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This is a projection supported by historical trends: nearly three-quarters of all armed conflicts between 1946 and 2011 took place in these two regions.90 Scenario-based projections necessarily lack any degree of certainty. What they do contribute, however, is a comprehensive assessment of the different ways which climate change can jeopardise security as well as a consideration of the intervening and interrelated factors which affect the likelihood of insecurity arising. This is exactly the kind of treatment that climate change necessitates as a result of the pervasive nature of its effects, which is to say that it is the insidiousness of climate change which demands that it be held up to scrutiny under a full spectrum of potential security scenarios. As Lord Stern reiterated ahead of the release of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment report in 2013: ""It would be absurd to say you are confident that the risks are small.""   Climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.

Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel   SCARCE FUTURES: Climate Change and Natural Resources  The most clearly recognised link between the environment and conflict is through natural resources, particularly water, and the large number of resource-related conflicts throughout history seems to evidence this. At least 40 per cent of all intrastate conflicts in the past 60 years have a link to natural resources and more than 18 violent conflicts have been fuelled by the exploitation of natural resources since 1990. In many cases, these historical conflicts have centred on resource abundance ­ or the acquisition and trade of resources with a high market value ­ which has subsequently played an important role in financing and sustaining conflict. In others, conflicts have broken out and peace-building efforts have been undermined by environmental scarcity ­ particularly of land and water ­ in areas where there is significant economic and social dependence on natural capital. In a small number of cases, conflicts emerged as a result of economic scarcity when the ability of groups or populations to secure access to natural capital was undermined or obstructed by others. Climate change primarily impacts on the latter two routes to instability: environmental and economic scarcity. Driven by population growth and rising per-capita incomes, today's global demand for natural resources is unprecedented and set to increase as the world's population grows to an estimated 9.6 billion by 2050.102 In 2013, Earth Overshoot Day ­ which annually marks the date when humanity has exhausted its `budget' of natural capital for the year and moves into ecological `deficit' ­ was 20 August and the date has been steadily arriving earlier and earlier year on year for the last few decades.103 Rising demand will contribute to local, national and regional scarcities of both renewable and non-renewable resources already exacerbated by the deleterious effects of climate change and a carbon-intensive economy. Never before has a clear understanding of the relationship between environmental change, resource availability and conflict been so important.  US$ 35 billion The amount the UN has spent deploying peacekeeping operations to conflicts involving natural resources Source: UNEP (2011) In areas where the abundance of natural capital is deteriorating as a result of climate change, environmental scarcity could lead to crises of availability which might cause some actors to perceive violence as the best alternative to other actions. For instance, climate-related water scarcity in the Horn of Africa has long generated conflicts between pastoralist and agrarian communities ­ which are now exacerbated by political transitions and the degradation of grasslands.105 Ecological regions vulnerable to climate change straddle multiple human societies, which can increase the potential for conflict: transboundary river basins and underground aquifers are particularly clear examples of this kind of potentially unstable co-dependency.  In Myanmar, natural resources have ignited and fuelled brutal conflicts for decades. © Rusty Stewart  Pressure on resources, climate change, population increases and the changing distribution of power are likely to result in increased instability and likelihood of armed conflict.  UK Ministry of Defence   Rainfall variability and drought have long caused resource-related conflicts between pastoralists and settled communities across arid regions of Africa. © IFRC  In societies where the uneven distribution of resources and services is already an issue, climate change may exacerbate inequalities and cause crises of accessibility which can lead to instability and conflict. Particular groups within societies, because of their social, ethnic, linguistic or religious characteristics, often experience forms of discrimination and marginalisation that restrict their access to natural resources and which can provide fertile breeding grounds for intrastate conflicts, particularly between groups of different ethnicity.106 The UK Ministry of Defence asserts that in contexts of poor governance, rapid population growth and ineffective resource management, climate change has a high likelihood of generating conflict.107 Clearly there is a real need to improve our understanding of how climate change affects the availability and accessibility of natural resources in particular regions. This research should form a foundation for action that enables collaborative rather than competitive approaches to resource management and protection in areas where types of natural capital are scarce. Strategies to secure access to resources which resemble `ring-fencing', or the use of force to privilege some groups over others, risk violating the basic human rights of vulnerable populations. In such cases, international and regional legal frameworks should focus on protecting the rights of individuals to secure access to the resources which are essential to their lives, livelihoods and psycho-social wellbeing.   A New Cold War?  On 27 August 2012, summer ice in the Arctic shrunk to the smallest extent on record ­ almost half that of its average during the 1970s.108 A significant proportion of the accelerated Arctic melt is a result of feedback mechanisms and the concentration of warming effects at the Earth's poles.109 Recent studies suggest that trans-Arctic shipping routes will be viable by mid-century.110 The opening up of the Arctic presents new opportunities for the commercial exploitation of oil, gas, coal, iron, diamonds and copper, as well as shipping and fishing routes which could bring Arctic countries into competition. A 2012 US National Academy of Sciences report envisages one such scenario: polar states develop assertive national postures, becoming concerned with the protection of what they perceive to be their core interests in the region, rebuild their military capabilities and reform old or create new defensive partnerships.111 The current claimants to the Arctic are Russia, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the United States ­ but even China, a `near-Arctic state' according to its own definition, has strong strategic interests in the region and has recently secured observer status in the Arctic Council.112 Russia's claim over the Lomonosov ridge ­ likely home to several billion barrels of Arctic oil ­ by a flag-planting submarine expedition in 2007 aggravated existing  disputes between itself and fellow claimants Canada and Denmark. The vast majority of Arctic resources, however, are within agreed national boundaries, whilst an eagerness to start profiting from exploitation, as well as the high costs of operating in the region, incentivise cooperation and conflict resolution.113 A 2013 American Security Project report calculates that a de-militarised Arctic is essential in an increasingly accessible region rich in opportunities for the exploitation of resources.114 However, the greatest Arctic security threat may not be human at all. The presence of huge amounts of subsurface methane, a greenhouse gas with 25 times the potency of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period, presents a real risk of vastly accelerating global climate change.115 Polar warming is already melting the permafrost which locks in this methane, causing it to escape into the atmosphere at an alarming rate.116 Recent research places the economic benefits of a race for Arctic resources in stark contrast to the global economic costs of a large release of Arctic methane over several decades which are calculated to total US$60 trillion.1 Throughout human history, mankind has raced to discover the next frontier. And time after time, discovery was swiftly followed by conflict. We cannot erase this history. But we can assure that history does not repeat itself in the Arctic.   UNDER FIRE OVER WATER: Conflict and Water Scarcity  28%  Water scarcity could have profound implications for security.  Increase in water conflicts in first decade of 21st Century compared to the previous 25 years Source: UNEP (2013) Some of the most severe impacts of climate change will be on freshwater resources. Mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st Century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential and seasonal river flows for the one-sixth of the world population living in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges. Rainfall variability and declining groundwater recharge will exacerbate drought in already water-stressed regions, while ground and surface water stores in low-elevation coastal zones and river deltas ­ home to two-thirds of the world's large cities with populations over five million ­ will be threatened by saltwater intrusion from rising sea levels and extreme hydro-meteorological hazards. An estimated 1.4 billion people inhabit river basins where water use already exceeds the minimum rate of recharge and a quarter of the world's population face severe water shortages for at least one month of every year. In regions already suffering acute water stress, a changing climate entails radical implications for a number of sectors including agriculture, city planning, energy production, public health and sanitation. Despite the achievement in 2010 of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of improved water access for 88 per cent of the world's population, huge numbers of people still lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation. With freshwater withdrawals for irrigation accounting for some 70 per cent of global freshwater use, climate change-related food insecurity from production bottlenecks or inefficient agricultural markets constitutes a real threat.  Hillary Clinton, former US Secretary of State123 For example, rapid depletion of the driving force behind the US agricultural revolution ­ the Ogallala aquifer ­ not only threatens the Midwest breadbasket but international food security as well. Declining supplies of freshwater as a result of climate change will also interact with complex pre-existing issues. In Yemen, for instance, where Sana'a could become the first capital city to run out of water, the effects of saltwater intrusion into groundwater supplies are exacerbated by the pumping of water out of underground aquifers to cultivate qat ­ a popular but illegal narcotic.126 There has not been a conventional interstate war directly attributable to water ­ although some suggest that control over the Jordan River basin was a major factor in the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War of 1967. There have, however, been hundreds of incidences where water was a major generator, strategic feature and objective of conflict.129 One influential study observes that ""water resources can make good relations bad and bad relations worse"" but highlights the fact that, as the majority of international interactions relating to transboundary water resources have been cooperative, institutional and governance contexts play a major role in mediating situations of potential conflict.130 Nevertheless, water scarcity has historically coincided with outbreaks of violence and instability ­ it played a central role in the collapse of the Anasazi and Mayan civilisations, among others. Water scarcity can be considered one of the principal factors influencing the outbreak of conflict in some contexts.133 From the low-intensity `water wars' between the city of Los Angeles and Owens Valley farmers in the early 20th Century to the civil unrest in 2000 surrounding the use and allocation of water from Baiyangdian Lake in China, inadequate supplies of clean freshwater for drinking, agriculture and energy production have led to political instability and, in some cases, outbreaks of violence throughout modern history. For the years 2000-2012, 88 per cent of the events listed by the Pacific Institute's chronology of water conflicts have involved violence.134 Quantitative research indicates that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) ­ which causes inter-decadal climate variability across many regions of the world ­ is associated with 21 per cent of civil conflicts in the years 1950 to 2004.1 In a context of climate change, energy production introduces a unique stress on water security. On the one hand, many less-developed countries favour hydroelectric dams as sources of renewable energy and as alternatives to coal and gas power. Damming, however, captures the sediment load of rivers and has implications for agricultural productivity and food security downstream, as well as accelerating processes of coastal erosion. More worryingly, as huge infrastructure projects, hydroelectric dams always create significant numbers of displaced people, which often generates intense conflicts.136 Sometimes these conflicts spill over into violence. China's dam projects within Myanmar have fuelled conflict and displacement: its Myitsone dam project has been a central point of contention driving the ongoing low-intensity civil war in Kachin state.137 Not enough action is being taken to prevent future conflicts over water resources. Since the start of the 21st Century, a growing proportion of conflicts over water resources are being driven by tensions related to joint management and infrastructure but there is a global lack of cooperation over shared water resources: 60 per cent of transboundary fresh water resources have no cooperative management systems  in place and, for those that do, less than 20 per cent have established multilateral agreements.138 Shared water sources and competing demands have been a source of tension between upstream and downstream communities throughout history. Disputes are likely to increase given that climate change exerts extra pressure on water resources, as the case of the Amu Darya river basin in Central Asia demonstrates. As water demand for food production and electricity generation increases, in part as a result of the quickening pace of climate change, so too must our efforts to provide water security. US Secretary of State John Kerry1When Rivers Run Dry Central Asia's Amu Darya river basin extends across Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Under the USSR's central planning, the Amu Darya river system became the focus for an extensive irrigation system that covered 70,000 km2 by 1980.140 In the post-Soviet period, water withdrawals are governed by four governments, each intent on pursuing their own national interests. Despite the establishment of the Interstate Coordinating Water Commission (ICWC) ­ under which states agreed to retain the Soviet system of water allocation ­ tensions over water run high.141 Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, water-hungry downstream states, consume some 85 per cent of the ICWC withdrawal quotas, despite most of the Amu Darya's water forming upriver in Tajikistan.142 Governments routinely accuse one another of breaching water quotas and localised pockets of armed violence and threats have already occurred: in 2001, Uzbek troops reportedly used force to gain control of water installations across the border in Turkmenistan.143 When Uzbekistan halted gas exports to Tajikistan in 2012 in retaliation for the Rogun dam development, it crippled the country's heavy industries.144 Later in the year, Uzbek President Karimov stated that mega-dam projects could result in ""not just serious confrontations, but even wars"".145 The Economist reports that Uzbekistan has even mined parts of the Uzbek-Tajik border, unilaterally closed all checkpoints and may have been implicated in the `terrorist' detonation of an Uzbek railway bridge in 2011 which wiped out southern Tajikistan's rail network.146 Despite the halting of Uzbek gas, yet again, in early 2013, Tajik president Emomalii Rahmon appears steadfastly committed to the Rogun` dam-building project.147 Climate change looks set to exacerbate insecurity in the region. As the glaciers of the Pamir mountain range which feed the Amu Darya continue to melt, water inflows will initially increase and then dramatically decrease.148 It is likely that Tajikistan will need to increase its dam reserves to safeguard its energy and water needs ­ an action which poses a direct threat to Uzbek livelihoods, the economy and the country's ability to support major cities such as Qarshi.149 Both the EU and the US Senate have acknowledged the security threat. The European Council and the European Commission concluded that water management has become the most sensitive environmental issue in Central Asia and that failure to address it could develop into ""a serious security threat for the entire region in the medium term"".150 Meanwhile, a majority staff report prepared for the Committee on Foreign Relations in the US Senate, warned that ""the impacts of water scarcity are fuelling dangerous tensions that will have repercussions for regional stability and US foreign policy objectives"".1 Not a Drop to Drink  In the third millennium BC, the kings of Lagash cut off water supplies to their rival Umma in a violent border dispute.152 There are a further 261 examples of the threatened or actual use of water as a weapon or political tool during the intervening thousands of years.153 In 2011, the European Union's Humanitarian Office claimed that pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya had deliberately shut off water to the capital, Tripoli.154 As mentioned, crises of accessibility can potentially lead to instability and conflict ­ particularly when they are concentrated amongst specific groups within a society and exclusionary in nature. A recent report from the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence similarly warns that over the coming decades countries are expected to increasingly instrumentalise water supplies as leverage in order to ""pressure populations and suppress separatist elements"".155 A senior US intelligence official has been quoted as saying that ""as water problems become more acute, the likelihood... is that states will use them as leverage"".156 Recent studies have already observed an increased incidence in the threatened or actual poisoning of water supplies over the last few decades.157 One common example is the IsraelPalestine conflict. Palestinian per-capita daily freshwater consumption is four times lower than Israeli use and below the World Health Organization standard.158 In the West Bank, approximately 300,000 Palestinians are vulnerable to water  scarcity ­ including 14,000 who are without any water infrastructure. Israeli settlers in the West Bank, by contrast, are serviced by Israel's national water authority and it is estimated that Israel consumes over 86 per cent of the West Bank's principal aquifer whilst controlling Palestinian extraction and prohibiting new wells. Limited access to freshwater does not always have to be in conflict situations in order to generate severe tensions and insecurity. In 2000, violent protests erupted in Bolivia's third largest city, Cochabamba, after a dramatic rise in water rates which priced impoverished citizens out of the market.161 In the same year, privatisation of water supplies in South Africa led to a cholera outbreak which infected approximately 120,000 people.162 Across the world, the blunt privatisation of water supplies by transnational companies penalises vulnerable sections of societies and sows considerable discontent.163 That climate change could drive the commodification of increasingly scarce water resources by increasing their economic value is particularly worrying, given the role that poverty plays in generating and sustaining conflict.    As water shortages become more acute beyond the next 10 years, water in shared basins will increasingly be used as leverage; the use of water as a weapon or to further terrorist objectives also will become more likely.

Generally speaking, people are likely to be temporarily displaced as a result of rapid-onset disasters or extreme weather events such as flooding, whilst slow-onset environmental degradation such as gradual declines in agricultural productivity generates longer-term, sometimes permanent, out-migration. Climate change already contributes to both migration and displacement. The two major pathways through which climate change and migration can be expected to impact on conflict are via livelihoods impacts and on the intensity and/or frequency of extreme weather events. Migration may be one of the simplest and most effective ways to build the resilience of communities whose livelihoods are curtailed or threatened by the impacts of climate change.171 At the same time, however, movements can take many forms, including: rural-to-urban migration; short-term or labour migration; undocumented migration across borders; and forced displacement. Consequently, unmanaged and unanticipated movements of people generate both operational and geopolitical challenges. For less-developed countries that face widespread internal displacement as a result of climate change, the threat of Climate change is today one of the main drivers of forced displacement, both directly through impact on environment ­ not allowing people to live any more in the areas where they were traditionally living ­ and as a trigger of extreme poverty and conflict. António Guterres, UN High Commissioner for Refugees172 becoming engulfed by humanitarian crises or under-resourced services in destination areas being overwhelmed and generating serious conflicts is very real. Other countries may have to reconcile the geopolitical conflict potential of cross-border movements with the necessity or desirability of out-migration from areas severely impacted by the deleterious effects of climate change. In 2008, the head of UNHCR, António Guterres, explicitly referred to the climate change-security-migration nexus when he stated that climate change was driving conflicts which were uprooting people from their homes.173 Unfortunately, the links between climate change, migration and conflict are noticeably under-researched. Rafael Reuveny, a prominent US academic, has collated existing research and compiled a list of nineteen instances of large-scale  Climate-related displacement in 20A Filipino boy carries supplies through floodwater. Over the last few years, storms and cyclones have displaced millions in the Philippines.  population movements in the 20th Century related to environmental or climatic changes which have resulted in violent conflict.174 It includes high-intensity conflicts such as the Football War between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969, the Rwandan civil war and genocide of the early 1990s and the Somalian-Ethiopian Ogaden War and border disputes. Other research focuses on the interaction between ecological dependence, poverty and conflict, suggesting that configurations of these factors shape the way in which civilians respond to economic and political threats and can create self-reinforcing cycles of `unsafe' migration.175 Studies focusing on refugee movements, meanwhile, demonstrate that forced displacement across borders can serve as a vector for the transmission of conflict to host regions as well as generating resource competition between displaced and host populations. It is important, however, not to underestimate the role of social and institutional contexts in undermining human security and generating situations of conflict.178 The idea that people whose lives and livelihoods are severely affected by the impacts of climate change will abandon their homes and move to richer countries is overly simplistic. Given that migration decisions at the individual and household level are shaped and constrained by both financial and social resources, the burden of care for those displaced will overwhelmingly fall on less-developed countries.179 Despite this, the idea of `floods' of people overwhelming the borders of more developed countries has prompted many states to press for tighter immigration controls ­ a move that jeopardises existing protection regimes for those fleeing persecution.180 This policy approach neither addresses the human rights implications of those affected by climate change nor fosters conditions that will enable social or economic development in countries of origin.  Enhancing the capacity of rural households to remain resilient in the face of climate change or adapt to its effects, increasing migration options at the policy level, bolstering the carrying capacities of urban centres, and reducing vulnerability to natural disasters offer the best means of assisting the countries that are first and worst affected by climate change in this respect. Ultimately, it is policy decisions that are made today which will determine whether migration is one amongst a range of adaptation options or a future necessity ­ as a matter of survival. We do not carelessly call climate change a security threat. When we are told by scientists to prepare for humanitarian crisis, including exodus, in our lifetimes, how can it be different from preparing for a threat like war? Joan Yang, Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations for Palau1 Stateless by Degrees  As sea levels rise, extreme hydro-meteorological hazards intensify, and coastal and marine ecosystems undergo accelerated degradation due to climatic change, low-elevation coastal zones are becoming some of the most vulnerable ecological regions in the world.182 At particular risk from these changes and hazards are small island developing states (SIDS). Research suggests that, regardless of mitigation scenarios, sea levels will continue to rise for centuries due to thermal expansion ­ making the catastrophic and literal disappearance of some SIDS inevitable.183 It is certain that, long before submersion, many inhabitants of SIDS will be forced to flee shrinking freshwater supplies, disasters and decimated livelihoods. Stuart Beck, Palau's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, described SIDS as ""in the red zone"" whilst Philip Mueller, Foreign Minister of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, has labelled his country ""ground zero"". Kiribati recently confirmed purchase of 6,000 acres of cultivable land in Fiji in the face of rising food insecurity ­ the land purchases had been rumoured to be for the purposes of population relocation. The threat to some SIDS is so severe that it undermines their very existence as sovereign nations ­ the most fundamental security of a state. The literal disappearance of states is unprecedented and its legal implications are uncertain.188 A complete loss of territory or population is technically  enough to challenge statehood itself but it seems that individual SIDS may well have to rely upon the willingness of other states to continue recognising a kind of `government-in-exile' ­ and other states to host them. Those forced to flee SIDS are out in the cold and completely unprotected by international law. They do not qualify as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention, and the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons was designed to respond to people denied a nationality by the actions of a state ­ not faced with the disappearance of one.189 Their presence in countries of resettlement would be entirely dependent on the good grace ­ or whims ­ of host governments. If SIDS governments managed to secure territory for the relocation of their citizens there is no guarantee that resettlement would respect the cultural, social and political rights of people to move with dignity, as community relocation in the Pacific has already demonstrated. Jurelang Zedkaia, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, has described relocation as an ""undeniable threat knocking at our door... a threat that the international community is presently unprepared to address"".192 It seems that whatever else the future holds, climate change may well lead to the death of nations ­ and almost certainly the death of cultures.   In Kiribati, Toani Benson stands in the submerged ruins of a shop which used to sell him petrol. © Mike Bowers/The Global Mail When the President of a low-lying island nation is forced to confront these issues of sovereignty and political borders, of statehood, of defending the very shores of his nation, it should be self-evident and beyond question that climate change impacts pose a clear threat to international peace and security. Jurelang Zedkaia, President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands19A Disaster Waiting to Happen?  Bangladesh is consistently identified as one of the countries most at risk from the impacts of climate change. Changes to precipitation patterns and surface temperatures are leading to increasingly significant changes in runoff with upward and downward shifts as high as 40 per cent in some ecological regions. This will exacerbate the intensity of both flooding and droughts. Accelerated glacial melt exacerbates river bank erosion, whilst rising sea levels and creeping saltwater intrusion threaten cultivable land and communities throughout the country.194 The fact that Bangladesh is the ninth most populous country in the world and one of the least developed means its capacity to assist and protect those displaced by the impacts of climate change is fundamentally constrained. Bangladesh's Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan states that ""millions"" of people are at risk from climate-induced displacement.195 These types of projections may be empirically unsound ­ but they reflect a very real underlying risk.196 The consequences of sea level rise alone are dramatic: Bangladesh stands to lose 15,668 km2 of coastline and 20.7 per cent of its land from a one-metre rise in sea level.197 The funnel-like coastal geography of Bangladesh channels the tidal effects of cyclones straight into densely populated areas ­ the average loss of life for each of the fifteen major cyclones since 1960 exceeds 46,000.198 The International Disaster Database, meanwhile, records that taken together the ten largest natural disasters in Bangladesh over the last 30 years have affected more than 260 million people.199 Bangladesh is a compelling example of a country where climate-induced displacement could generate both operational and geopolitical crises which exacerbate instability. Within Bangladesh, migration is an established and traditional risk-reducing strategy in a country where, during monsoon seasons, up to a third of the country can be inundated ­ households often send family members to nearby urban centres or agricultural areas to diversify household income streams and manage risk.200 Field research, however, indicates that the additional strain of climate change is exacerbating conflicts over land in migrant sending-areas suffering from high salinity and fuelling tensions over water on coastal and river islands (chars).201 Conflicts are also arising in migrant receiving-areas ­ violence between local and immigrant communities over land, water and employment is a complaint voiced across Bangladesh from small villages to Dhaka.202 Migration has already been linked to the emergence of violent conflicts within Bangladesh. During the latter half of the 20th Century, large-scale environmentally induced migration into Bangladesh's only highland area, the Chittagong Hill Tract, exacerbated the tensions which eventually erupted into two decades of armed conflict between the state and the Chittagong hill tribes.203 Multiple stressors could result in a cascading effect where environmental degradation, accelerated rural-urban migration and declines in human security all feedback to reinforce internal migration dynamics.204 This could seriously impede state capacity to maintain food and water security, contain health crises, provide safe habitable spaces in urban areas and counteract loss of livelihoods ­ one former Bangladeshi general has even been quoted as saying: ""Bangladesh's internal regions are already under stress.  Climate change is an unfolding physical phenomenon with very drastic and adverse environmental, economic, social and human consequences, particularly for Bangladesh. A. K. Khander, Chairperson, Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan205 The worst-case scenario for Bangladesh, which has been identified by military analysts in the US, is of state collapse"".206 Such statements remain, for now, in the domain of risk assessment, but research addressing the potential for migration to generate conflict does indicate, for instance, that ""unstable urban and rural demographics are related to higher risks of civil war, and low-level communal conflicts during periods of environmental stress are common.""207 Some researchers show how water and land scarcity in rural Bangladesh ­ in operation with other political and economic drivers ­ have historically caused cross-border migration into Northeast India and subsequently generated severe conflicts in migrant receiving-areas. If future climate change has a sufficiently transformative effect on coping strategies in rural Bangladesh (such as temporary labour migration to cities), or if the capacity of the Bangladeshi state to `rehabilitate' areas and populations affected by climate-related disasters becomes severely compromised, then increased cross-border movements to India may result. This could have serious implications.

Without sufficient action, climate-induced displacement could destabilise the entire country of Bangladesh. The gravest effect of climate change may be on human migration.  Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh2In a security briefing, the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies outlines concerns that migration could spill over the Bangladeshi border and exacerbate tensions with India.211 A Center for American Progress report emphasises that potential future changes to South Asian migration patterns must be seen within the regional and historical cultural, political, religious and ethnic contexts.212 It recalls the rise of anti-immigrant violence in areas of Northeast India, particularly Assam, which resulted in over 7,000 deaths during the 1980s, concluding that ""the political and social implications of even a modest increase or perception of increase in the number of immigrants across India's borders need to be taken very seriously.""213 Though it is hard to derive accurate statistics concerning undocumented migration, the Bangladesh-India flow has been described as one of the largest bilateral migration corridors in the world.214 India has indicated that it sees immigration from its neighbour as a social and economic threat. Responding to this threat, it began constructing a fence to stem flows of smuggled goods, undocumented migrants and armed militants in the 2000s. As of 2007, over half of the border had already been sealed ­ human rights groups express ongoing concern at the Indian Border Security Force's excessive use of lethal force against Bangladeshi civilians.Local concerns regarding the delicate balance between India and Bangladesh are echoed within the wider security community. A report from the German Advisory Council on Climate Change, an independent scientific body, presents a `fictitious confrontation scenario' based on a breakdown of disaster management in Bangladesh.217 They predict that in a situation where stronger cyclones and tidal surges encounter poor disaster preparedness and governance systems, protracted local displacement could force people onwards towards the interior and borders. Internal frictions in non-coastal regions between Muslim immigrants and minority Hindu locals might re-ignite ethnic conflicts, whilst rampant undocumented migration to India could generate diplomatic and political tensions ­ potentially leading to Indian threats of `humanitarian intervention'. A publication from the Henry L. Stimson Center, a US-based security think-tank, agrees that the future of IndianBangladeshi relations will depend, to a significant degree, on the extent of environmental impacts and the capacity of the Bangladeshi state to respond to the vast operational challenges that they present.2 Deserted Livelihoods  Much like the desert itself, crises in the Western Sahel cut across political boundaries. The predominantly rural populations of this region's desert, semidesert, savannah and savannah woodland ecologies are highly sensitive to rainfall variability and the periodic failure of agricultural and pastoralist livelihoods leads to widespread food insecurity. A 2011 UNEP report outlines in detail the role of climate change-induced livelihoods insecurity and natural disasters in impacting on existing migration patterns, pervasive conflicts and structural underdevelopment.219 Meanwhile, the links between a changing climate, the migration of pastoralists into agricultural areas and subsequent conflicts over land and water are well documented across the Sahel and the wider continent. On a tour of the Sahel region, the former Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General for Conflict Prevention and Resolution expressed particular concerns about the potential for climate change-induced migration and the availability of small arms and light weapons in the region to amplify conflicts.222 One Center for American Progress report, focusing on the ""arc of tension"" stretching from Nigeria through Niger and Algeria to Morocco, similarly emphasises that a range of environmental and economic problems in conflict-affected areas which already generate significant population mobility in the Sahel will be severely impacted by climate change.2The relatively prosperous North African countries are themselves becoming destinations for many African migrants, particularly after the closure by Frontex ­ the EU's border guard force ­ of Mediterranean channels facilitating irregular entry into Europe. This trend brings new human security challenges as the demand for unskilled migrant workers in North African countries jars with their broad failure to observe and uphold international human rights standards.224 The National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) submitted to the UNFCCC by Burkina Faso, Mali, the Gambia, Cape Verde, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau all acknowledge the threat that conflict could arise from rural-rural and rural-urban migration patterns linked to climate change.225 Within contexts of underdevelopment, previous or existing conflict and in the face of emerging security challenges ­ such as armed non-state groups and the increasing significance of trans-Sahelian drugs and weapons-trafficking routes ­ the impact of climate change risks overpowering the capacities of these fragile African states.   Too many Malians are resorting to guns to settle their grievances with each other as runaway population growth, shrinking water resources and deteriorating pastoral and agricultural land are turning neighbours into enemies all over this vast and ancient country. Jan Egeland, former Special Advisor to the UN Secretary General for Conflict Prevention and Resolution2THE DELICATE BALANCE: State Fragility and Climate Change  According to the World Bank, fragile and conflict-affected states host some 25 per cent of the world population and constitute the toughest developmental challenge of our era.227 They are plagued by high poverty rates, fractious or unstable political settlements, public health crises and stalled economies. Fragility refers to a number of different but often overlapping characteristics, including: political instability, the inability to deliver basic services, vulnerability to humanitarian emergencies and endemic political or legitimacy crises as well as conflict or post-conflict situations. The rise of intrastate or internal conflicts since the end of World War II has left behind poisonous legacies of environmental distress, political and economic instability, social fragmentation and persisting trauma. In fact, from Northern Ireland to Mali to Papua New Guinea, many fragile and conflict-affected areas exhibit multiple forms of violence: political conflict, intergroup violence, widespread gang violence and transnational organized criminal or terrorist networks.228 Fragility is a hard trap to escape. Research suggests that around 40 per cent of all post-conflict societies relapse into violence within one decade ­ and economies dependent on natural resources such as timber or agricultural exports face even more acute risks of relapse. Even without widespread violence, ineffective governance and low-intensity conflicts can severely arrest development ­ Myanmar, for instance, has been plagued by an endless stream of internal conflicts since independence; one of them, at 63 years, was the longest `civil war' in modern history.231 The cyclical nature of fragility ­ recurring violence and derailed social and economic progress ­ erodes the capacities and resources of both communities and states, making them vulnerable to external shocks such as those induced by climate change. As with conflict itself, direct links between climate change and state fragility are weak. This does not, however, mean that climate change cannot have strong causal impacts on the rapid or eventual emergence of fragility. First of all, it is necessary to distinguish between the primary and secondary impacts of climate change. While a drought may curtail a population's access to or the regional availability of food supplies in the short-term, it also has long-term implications, such as: changes in migration patterns (from the reallocation of household labour); arrested childhood development (from using meal-skipping as a coping strategy); and even national trade deficits and structural debt (from the decimation of primary commodity export bases). Consequently, the emphasis should not be on whether climate change can itself be considered a driver of state fragility but how climate change impacts on existing drivers of state fragility. In this context, climate change exerts additional pressures on the institutional, social and economic stressors which render states fragile. Security analyses subsequently try to identify the critical thresholds or `tipping points' whereby the influence of climate change can catalyse instability and ignite conflict.  If the destabilizing effects of climate change go unchecked, we can expect more frequent, widespread, and intense failed state scenarios creating large-scale humanitarian disasters and higher potential for conflict and terrorism. Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, US Navy (Ret.)232 A report prepared by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security for presentation to the European Council, for instance, warns that climate change has the potential to ""significantly increase instability in weak or fragile states by over-stretching the already limited capacity of governments to respond effectively to the challenges they face"".233 In early 2013, US chief of military forces in the Pacific, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, stated that unrest and instability as a result of climate change ""is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen... that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about"".234 Security assessments are complicated enormously by the fact that the extent of climate impacts on global, regional and local stability in the long term remains to be determined. A recent Chatham House report emphasises that the timescale over which climate change unfolds presents a fundamental challenge to policymakers concerned with global networks of vulnerability and the risk of high-impact, low-probability events (such as a super cyclonic storm) with potentially enormous ramifications for national and international security.235 Similarly, the global climate is governed by complex feedback effects which respond to both environmental and human variables. Consequently, processes of change can lead to drastic, unpredictable and sometimes irreversible outcomes which can have major security implications ­ consider, for example, the abrupt release of Arctic methane mentioned earlier in this report. The pathways through which climate change can impact upon existing drivers of state fragility may be complex, circuitous and interrelated: for example, states vulnerable to economic shocks caused by climate impacts on local productivity or global commodity chains are at risk of instability if they have rapidly   growing populations. Unemployment and social exclusion amongst populations of young adult males, in particular, can swell enlistment in armed groups, which threatens the stability of states.238 A recent National Intelligence Council report states that ""water problems ­ when combined with poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions ­ contribute to social disruptions that can result in state failure.""239 A 2013 report considers the influence that climate change had on exacerbating the conditions which gave rise to the Arab Spring and accelerating its eruption across the Middle East and North Africa.240 The ability of fragile states to respond to the complex constellations of factors which drive instability is fundamentally constrained. Under-resourced institutions severely curtail state performance.241 When a country such as the Central African Republic receives a mere US$53 in per-capita tax revenues ­ compared to Denmark's US$18,100 ­ there are upper limits to what states can achieve, both in adapting to the new challenges climate change presents and responding to existing drivers of stability which may be aggravated by change. The implications of a failure to balance the complex needs and demands of populations in contexts of fragility include growing disenfranchisement with and resistance to central governments, inflamed tensions based on religious, ethnic and social fault-lines, increased political radicalisation and a potential strengthening or consolidation of non-state actors which threaten state security. Consequently for fragile states in particular, climate change will be the ultimate test of resilience.   Observers note that water shortages, crop failure and rural-urban migration may have contributed to the ongoing civil war in Syria. © Freedom House  It is unlikely that climate change will be a direct cause of conflict. However, the impact of the second- and third-order consequences -- loss of land or livelihood -- has the potential to increase the risks of global instability and conflict in those parts of the world already experiencing other stresses.  Rear Admiral Neil Morisetti, former UK Special Representative for Climate Change2 A Climate Change War?  Climate change, land degradation and the resulting competition over scarce natural resources are among the root causes as well as the consequences of the violence and grave humanitarian situation in the region. United Nations Environment Programme2Prior to separation in 2011, the former country of Sudan endured several decades of civil conflict between rebel forces (including the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement), the Sudanese Government and the government-backed janjawid militia. This tension was concentrated in the western region of Darfur, and culminated in a situation that became one of the most pressing and longstanding humanitarian crises in the world. An estimated two million people are believed to have died as a result of fighting and conflict-induced famine, whilst four million people were forced from their homes.246 The origins of the conflict in Darfur have been attributed to many different factors at local, regional and international levels, including post-colonial legacies.247 Following a report released by UNEP and an article published in Nature in 2007, commentators started to refer to Darfur as a `climate change war' ­ a similar connection was made by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon./250 Understandably, this has sparked heated debate and it seems reductionist to obscure the complex causes of a particularly violent conflict by attributing it to a single factor.251 The argument, however, that climate change and ecological stress contributed to the intensity and duration of the conflict by impacting on the existing drivers of insecurity is hard to refute. Former Sudan was the largest country in Africa and sections of its population faced severe shortages of productive land through a combination of overgrazing, deforestation, topsoil erosion and declining freshwater availability. During the 20th Century, the boundary between semi-desert and desert shifted by an estimated 50-200km.252 The decline in cultivable land was exacerbated by droughts, erratic rainfall, and population growth (human and animal), which created subsequent issues concerning land tenure and use. This situation placed ethnic groups with different traditions of land use against one another.2As grazing grounds were lost, for instance, the predominantly pastoral Zaghawa people saw their livelihoods threatened. Whilst nomadism and migration constitute well-established strategies for coping with drought in Africa, the comparatively poor availability of productive land brought Zaghawa pastoralists into areas inhabited by sedentary agriculturalists such as the Fur.254 Subsequent conflict was exacerbated by both groups using force to protect access to wadis ­ seasonal riverbeds formed of clay. Darfur was already a seat of tensions influenced by deep-rooted ethnic and social divisions within former Sudan, exacerbated by years of regionalised underdevelopment and easy access to small arms. Environmental stressors helped translate these pressure points into a situation of heightened instability and then conflict. Because of this, it is more accurate to describe the conflict as being rooted in the multiple religious, ethnic and socio-economic divides that existed in former Sudan; where unequal political power,   A UN Peacekeeper speaks with three Sudanese boys in Darfur. In 2014, competition over resources and land is once again fuelling conflict and violence in this region. © UN Photo/Albert Gonzalez Farran  control over and access to resources resulted in at least two lethal and devastating wars which together lasted over 50 years. Climate change ­ as has been stressed in much of the literature outlined throughout this report ­ clearly acted as a threat multiplier by transmitting and intensifying risk. In light of this analysis of the Darfur conflict and in regard to future and emerging scenarios, we should conclude that there is a strong relationship between climate change, fragility and conflict ­ but that the links are mediated by a range of social, political and economic factors specific to particular contexts and periods. Political settlements, the availability of natural resources, patterns of human migration, and governance structures all have the potential to influence whether climate change, in one context, leads to conflict but in another does not. Research in West Africa, for instance, shows that climatic variability led to rural livelihood insecurity and migration that pitted pastoralist communities against agriculturalist communities, in a similar situation to Darfur.255 In West Africa, however, traditional conflict resolution structures which focus on the stewardship of natural resources over the apportionment of blame for misuse successfully arrested anything beyond specific and localised instances of violence. Meanwhile for Somalia, a `perfect storm' of drought, poor governance and low-intensity conflict have erupted in humanitarian crises and virtual state collapse.256 The case of Darfur underscores how centrally important it is to view each  conflict as unique, examining its causes through a holistic approach that includes the environment and climate change as well as other socio-economic factors. As a 2013 report from the Environmental Change and Security Program at the US-based Woodrow Wilson Center reiterates, there is little doubt that climate change complicates conflict prevention, resolution and peace-building in many regions across the world.257 Effective climate change adaptation could potentially prevent countries from reaching tipping points which expose large populations to conflict and violence. Failure to adequately prepare now, on the other hand, directly places significant numbers of people at future risk. Amid the diverse social and political causes, the Darfur conflict began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon2 Internal Decay  Military experts in the US have been among the first to draw a connection between climate change and terrorism. The 2014 US Quadrennial Defense Review noted that the effects of climate change will aggravate the stressors ""that can enable terrorist activity.""259 This is undoubtedly a controversial view. But there is some evidence that suggests linkages between climate change, violent non-state actors and security. As mentioned earlier in this report, the devastating 2010 floods in Pakistan most likely consolidated the Taliban's hold on vast swathes of territory after they capitalised on the anger and frustration of those left stranded by the inept or non-existent disaster response efforts of the Zardari government. In fact, the inadequate response to the floods played a major role in the subsequent toppling of the Zardari premiership. Zardari's staunchly anti-militant legacy and fierce hatred of the Taliban is finding infertile ground in post-Zardari Pakistan's political landscape.262 Nigeria offers a pertinent example of the nexus between ethnic insurgencies, terrorism and energy security. In some studies, Nigeria ranks as one of the most climate-sensitive countries in the world, with internecine conflict, underdevelopment, economic malaise and corruption all significantly hindering the country's capacity to adapt to climate change.263 Prior to 2012, Nigerian oil constituted approximately 10 per cent of US imports and, though imports are now declining in the face of large-scale exploitation of US shale gas reserves, national and international energy security is still a core pillar of US military involvement in African and Middle-Eastern theatres.In a 2007 speech to Congress, then Director of National Intelligence, John McConnell, highlighted US fears of Nigerian instability.266 Over half a decade on and climate-vulnerable Nigeria, wracked by sectarian and religious conflict, has failed to resolve the endemic and violent economic, social and political crises disrupting oil production. Some Western military analysts fear that Nigeria is facing increasing infiltration from extremist Islamist groups operating in the `ungoverned spaces' of the Sahara, but Nigerians themselves point to the decades of ecological degradation, increasing climate variability and food insecurity as contributing to the blossoming of home-grown terrorist movements such as Boko Haram. The argument that climate change is a direct cause of terrorism or extremism is, of course, almost never made. It is argued that, in contributing to destabilisation, climate change can help create spaces in which state capacity is diminished to such an extent that non-state actors have the freedom to carry out the various activities which enable them to thrive. Economic malaise has long been recognised as one of the `root causes' of terrorism. Security analysts now speak of the linkages between climate change's deleterious impacts on economic development and subsequent challenges addressing one of the underlying factors influencing the rise and persistence of terrorist networks ­ poverty.2 In the long term, we want to address the underlying conditions that terrorists seek to exploit... But climate change prolongs those conditions. It makes them worse.

E©GUATNHEPRhINoGtoS/TSOtRuMart P3r5ice   ...climate change is always refracted through the complex socio-political, economic and cultural relations of different societies. It is precisely the way in which climate change might impact on those relations, and the way that those societies then choose to respond to those impacts, that determines the trajectory toward violence. Dr Nafeez Ahmed, Executive Director of Institute for Policy Research and Development2THE GATHERING STORM  CONCLUSION  The threat posed by climate change cannot be understated. In May 2013, measurements of the global concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million.274 The last time such levels were present, during the Pliocene era three million years ago, sea levels were nine to 27 metres higher.275 We are currently only spared such effects by the time that it takes for the climate to respond and reach equilibrium with GHG levels. Climate change is fast becoming one of the most pressing issues on the international security agenda. Its nature as a threat multiplier not only jeopardises the fundamental human rights of populations but also pushes some of the world's poorest and most vulnerable people deeper into poverty.276 It amplifies strains on infrastructure and services within society, and on national and international governance structures. Where exposure to the impacts of climate change is greatest, sensitivities are high, and there is limited resilience, states face a pressing security threat. Depending on how affected populations react to this threat, the impacts of climate change may contribute to the outbreak of conflict or help sustain existing conflicts. This report has highlighted the particular role played by climate change in combination with different types of resource conflicts, patterns of human migration, and existing situations of fragility in generating insecurity and conflict. In accordance with the fact that climate change takes the most from those who have the least, climate impacts will be most profoundly felt in regions and countries where exposure is greatest and where there is the lowest capacity to adapt. Many climate-vulnerable regions already exist in situations of state fragility, conflict or post-conflict recovery. The potent significance of the fact that the world's major military powers and security institutions consistently and increasingly voice their concerns regarding the impacts of climate change jars with the simple fact that there has been a failure to act on the issue. EJF interprets this collective failure as the gravest threat to human and national security: the insecurity wrought by climate change is the defining global human rights issue of the 21st Century. Where existing international human rights frameworks have sufficient scope to protect those affected by the impacts of climate change, regulatory measures and precedents need to be established and then rigorously and equitably enforced.277 Where existing legal frameworks fall short of protection and mandating assistance for some groups, sui generis instruments may need to be created. Of equal importance is the gradual recognition that not only ethical but legal, rights-based imperatives need to exist for the safeguarding of the environment for future generations.278 The notion of `climate security' is what provides the linkages between climate change as a physical and environmental process and climate change as a human rights issue. For this reason alone, the increasing attention that security institutions are paying climate change ­ which this report has highlighted ­ should be of the highest significance to policymakers, academics and the public.  The recognition of climate change as a threat not only to the stability of ecological systems which have sustained human life for thousands of years but also to the rights of those living today, who are often the most vulnerable and exposed, is the siren call for a new paradigm of environmental cooperation in which progressive and ambitious action on climate change should be central to conflict prevention and human rights protection strategies. There is no reason why the international community cannot avoid escalating conflicts, tensions and insecurity related to a changing climate if a deliberate, focused and collective response can be catalysed that tackles the root causes, scale, potential volatility and velocity of the challenges emerging. Achim Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)279 Climate change not only exacerbates threats to international peace and security ­ it is a threat to international peace and security. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon2RECOMMENDATIONS  The international community must  National governments should  · Establish a new mandate for a UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change to safeguard against the worst-case scenarios of the human impact of climate change. · Consolidate political will for renewed international action on climate change. · Immediately develop research into the relationship between climate change, human rights and conflict, focusing on: · How climate change affects the availability and accessibility of natural resources in particular regions. · How climate change impacts upon patterns of human migration in specific social, political, cultural and economic contexts. · How climate change impacts upon the resilience and stability of individual states. · Interpret climate change as an opportunity for peace-building, cooperation and enhancing transnational resource management.  · Deliver `linked-up' policies on environment, human rights, development, migration and peacebuilding. · Ratify or work to generate national, regional and international legal frameworks protecting citizens from climate-related insecurity · Collaborate to ensure that agreements governing. transboundary water resources are in place and operating effectively to avert conflict. EJF will · Continue to call for urgent action to address the human impacts of climate change from a rights-based framework. · Endeavour to contribute to improving understanding of the relationships between climate change and security.  A coastal road in Queensland, Australia in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi.© Paul Toogood   Glossary  CLIMATE JUSTICE: Climate change has ethical dimensions which relate to concepts of justice and decision-makers must address the unequal degrees of responsibility for and exposure to climate change between different countries. CLIMATE SECURITY: Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies are essential parts of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of vulnerable populations. In the broadest sense, a stable global climate provides a safe operating space for humanity. ECOLOGICAL DEPENDENCE: Populations are ecologically dependent when they have a high degree of sensitivity to changes in the availability or accessibility of natural capitals or valuable ecosystem goods and services. FEEDBACK EFFECTS: Effects of processes within a chain of cause and effect which form a circuit. Negative feedback effects counteract the processes which give rise to them whilst positive feedback effects amplify them. For instance, a car deviating from its course is corrected by negative feedback (adjusting the steering). If the car's steering mechanism was faulty and adjustments to steering amplified deviation, this would be positive feedback.  GROUNDWATER RECHARGE: The rate at which sub-surface supplies of freshwater are sustainably replenished. For some freshwater resources, such as fossil water, this rate may be so slow that they are considered `non-renewable'. HYDRO-METEOROLOGICAL HAZARDS: Refers to any hydrological, atmospheric or oceanographic phenomenon which may cause loss of life, injury, damage to property, loss of livelihoods, environmental harm or social and economic disruption (e.g. floods, cyclones, coastal storm surges, etc). TIPPING POINT: When the accumulation of minor changes or events in a system reaches a critical threshold whereupon drastic, sudden and sometimes irreversible developments fundamentally alter the state of the system. THREAT MULTIPLIER: Rather than constituting a `new' threat in itself, climate change acts upon existing threats and hazards to amplify or exacerbate the risk that they pose. UNGOVERNED SPACES: Where territorial state control has been voluntarily or involuntarily ceded to actors other than the relevant, legally sovereign authorities, and/or the state faces significant challenges in establishing control.

FoE-2015-2.txt,"RIGHTS FOR BUSINESS, NOT FOR PEOPLE THE EU'S AGENDA ""If there ever was a one-sided dispute-resolution mechanism that "" violates basic principles, this is it.40 Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel laureate in economics, commenting on ISDS  INTRODUCTION  Transnational corporations enjoy enormous power. Their resources dwarf those of many nation states but their power is not always exercised with care as numerous examples of corporate human rights violations and environmental damage show. Despite these crimes, it has been almost impossible to prosecute transnational corporations internationally, leaving some of the worst offenders unpunished. On 26 June 2014 the UN Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for an intergovernmental working group to establish binding rules for businesses in relation to human rights ­ a process commonly referred to as the ""Treaty"". This historic decision means that international human rights law will for the first time apply to the activities of transnational corporations. The European Commission and EU member states proudly claim to actively promote and defend human rights internally and abroad1. But the EU permanent mission in Geneva and member states have tried to frustrate and derail the progress of this working group. Instead the EU wants to rely solely on a set of voluntary principles. This would mean that corporations would not be legally accountable for human rights violations. Yet there is no hesitation from the EU when it comes to securing privileged treatment for corporations around the globe through investment treaties and trade deals. These often include businessfriendly private tribunals (rebranded as investment courts by the EU) that wield the power to make governments compensate corporations for any new laws or regulations that reduce corporate profits. This parallel legal system is exclusively accessible to corporations, or more specifically to foreign investors, and is tilted in their favour. And the problem is about to get a lot worse as negotiations for an EUUS free trade deal (TTIP) and a free trade agreement with Canada (CETA) would significantly expand the corporate tribunals' reach. This paper outlines how the European Commission and EU member states are aggressively pushing rights for businesses, but refusing to engage in constructive talks at the UN level on establishing rights for people affected by the activities of those companies.   1. EUROPE: CHAMPIONING CORPORATE PRIVILEGES  Corporate tribunals, called investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), are generally included in bilateral investment agreements (BITs) ­ agreements between two countries that grant extra protection for investments from foreign companies. EU countries are world leaders in signing bilateral investment treaties, and almost all of these treaties contain ISDS2. Between them, the 28 EU member states (who together generate less than a quarter of global economic output) have signed 1,545 BITs, more than half of all BITs worldwide3. European companies are also the biggest users of investment arbitration. Nine European countries are among the top 12 states for ISDS claims4. Companies from the Global North are responsible for 80% of all ISDS claims5. Some European countries have worded their BITs in a particularly investor-friendly way. The Netherlands, for example, which is one of the leading EU countries in terms of signing BITs and the second highest source of claims, gives particularly wide-ranging rights to investors6. A recent study found that around three quarters of claims under Dutch BITs are brought by ""mailbox companies"" that do not have substantial business activities in the Netherlands, but who take advantage of the investor-friendly wording in Dutch BITs to increase the chances of their case7. In the Netherlands, giving investors the most expansive privileges possible has become official government policy8. European countries have also been behind thinly veiled threats against countries that are taking steps to get out of this lop-sided ISDS system. When South Africa decided to terminate its BITs with some EU countries to reduce the risk of potentially massive liabilities, the then Trade Commissioner Karel de Gucht said the change was ""not good for South Africa"". Using strong language, he and several EU member state ambassadors expressed their ""unhappiness"" to South Africa9.  "" In my view, and in the view of the Netherlands and many other States, I think it is very important to make sure that we use as few as possible limitations [to investor rights], because at the end of the day we want to stimulate investment. We want to stimulate modern types of investment and we don`t want to create unnecessary policy spaces and other ways that host "" States can use to limit and to restrict investors39. Nikos Lavranos, former senior trade policy adviser in the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs  WHAT IS ISDS AND WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH IT? Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) allows foreign investors to seek financial compensation from host countries in secret, business-friendly tribunals if they deem that their investment potential or profits are affected by changes in the host country's policies or regulation. If a government loses a case, it has to compensate the investor from taxpayers' money with pay outs easily reaching hundreds of millions or even billions of Euro. ISDS cases are heard by international arbitration panels, made up of three lawyers who specialise in such cases for a fee. It is expensive, with each case costing on average US$8 million. The state's costs are born by taxpayers. There are many criticisms of the current ISDS system:  It's unjust Laws and regulations that are entirely within a government's rights to enforce can be successfully challenged. ISDS creates a system in which a small, already influential group (foreign investors) increases its power in society at the expense of everyone else. It's unequal Only foreign investors can access ISDS to sue government. This discriminates against national investors and everyone else in society. Governments cannot sue foreign investors through ISDS. It's a one-way street. It's unbalanced ISDS does not impose any requirements on foreign investors ­ they don't have to adhere to national or international social or environmental standards to use ISDS, nor can they be held responsible for infringements of human rights or environmental laws through ISDS.  It's undemocratic ISDS has been successfully used to threaten legislators into watering down environmental standards in order to avoid costly and lengthy legal challenges10. It also has a chilling effect on the creation of new legislation, with legislators seeking to avoid being challenged through ISDS. As such, it limits and weakens democratic decision making. It's unfair Many lawyers act as both arbitrators and counsel, systematically creating conflicts of interests11. Since only investors can file cases, there is an inherent bias in the process and a risk that arbitrators adopt investor-friendly interpretations of the investment treaty texts to expand the scope of the ISDS mechanism12. It's unnecessary Foreign investors can access national courts, just like everyone else in society. There is no justification for creating a parallel legal system that is biased in their favour.  Protests in Brussels against the planned free trade agreement TTIP  4 RIGHTS FOR BUSINESS, NOT FOR PEOPLE: THE EU'S AGENDA   TTIP & OTHER TRADE DEALS: EXPANDING CORPORATE POWER  The EU Commission and EU member states are currently working to massively expand the scope of ISDS through major new trade deals, despite significant public opposition. These include: · The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada negotiations are complete, including an ISDS clause that threatens environmental and health regulations on both sides of the Atlantic13. · The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) ­ this is set to include an investment chapter. The European Commission has proposed a new Investment Court, but this would still result in the same fundamental problems as ISDS14. · A new BIT is currently being negotiated with China with strong support from corporate lobby groups like BusinessEurope15. In a recent public consultation, more than 97% of the respondents objected to the inclusion of ISDS in TTIP. The Commission has ignored public opposition in publishing a proposal for an Investment Court that replicates most of the major flaws that make the current ISDS system untenable16. ISDS has also recently been included in other international agreements: · The recently concluded Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) between 12 Pacific countries including the US and Japan contains an ISDS provision, despite signatory countries including Canada, Mexico, Australia and Peru having had bad experiences with ISDS17. · Canada recently signed a BIT with China and the US and China are also negotiating an investment agreement. TTIP alone would massively increase the amount of investment flows covered by ISDS, so increasing the risk of governments being sued as a result of public policy measures. A recent analysis estimated that current BITs and other investment agreements cover 15-20% of worldwide international investment flows18. The new trade and investment treaties mentioned above would increase this to approximately 80%19. The enormous scope of the new treaties makes them a huge threat to governments' scope for public policies.  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN TTIP ­ MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A MOLEHILL TTIP includes a sustainable development chapter which, according to the European Commission, aims to promote social development and environmental protection. A leaked copy of the Commission's proposal shows that it: · does not provide adequate protection for an array of environmental policies that TTIP would undermine; · consists of vaguely-worded, nonbinding environmental provisions; · fails to include any meaningful enforcement mechanism. An analysis of the proposal concludes that ISDS would trump any environmental provisions arising from the agreement, once again confirming that the Commission puts corporate privileges ahead of any other concerns20. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THE TRANS PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Article 9.16 of the investment chapter of the TPP reaffirms that members of the treaty should encourage their businesses to voluntarily incorporate internationally recognised Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) standards, guidelines and principles that the members have endorsed. This emphasis on the voluntary nature of CSR stands in stark contrast to the legally enforceable, far reaching rights accorded to investors.  6 RIGHTS FOR BUSINESS, NOT FOR PEOPLE: THE EU'S AGENDA  2. THE EU'S CSR AGENDA: A LOT OF WORDS, LITTLE ACTION  The European Commission likes to portray itself as a champion of human rights and declares that promoting and defending these within the EU and abroad is a central tenet of EU policy21. Despite on-going discussions on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the EU for a decade and a half22, the EU does not have a coherent and robust policy on CSR. This means there are no clear standards for European companies and financiers when they operate outside EU boundaries. The Commission's strategy is, instead, to rely on companies acting on a voluntary basis. Yet growing numbers of environmental and human rights defenders are being intimidated, arrested, tortured or sometimes killed for protesting against the activities of European companies and their financiers23. Without access to justice in their own countries, these people have nowhere to turn. The only way in which affected communities can pursue justice is to present a case to an OECD National Contact Point in the EU country where the company is based. Or they can make a complaint to one of the multi-stakeholder processes such as the Round table of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Either route requires resources and rarely leads to a satisfying outcome from the perspective of a victim of human rights violations. None of these procedures are legally binding and none of these bodies can enforce sanctions. But while the EU overlooks the rights of individuals and communities affected by the activities of European companies, the same companies and foreign investors are being given strong, fully enforceable rights and a parallel legal process where they can present their claims.  ""The financial crisis has demonstrated the difficulty of relying on business to voluntarily self-regulate. In particular, weak and poor States suffer the consequences of an asymmetry in the international system where the business companies rights are backed up by hard laws and strong enforcement mechanisms while their obligations are backed up only by soft laws like "" voluntary guidelines.41 H. E. Archbishop Silvano M. Tomasi, Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations  THE 2009 EDINBURGH STUDY ON THE NEED TO GO BEYOND VOLUNTARY MEASURES Under pressure from civil society groups and the European Parliament, in 2009 the Commission released a study analysing the existing legal framework for European companies operating outside the European Union. The study addressed the role of European companies, their subsidiaries and contractors where violations of human rights and environmental law occurred outside the EU and described the significant obstacles third-country victims encounter in obtaining effective redress both in the host country as well in the European Union. These included time limits, legal costs and evidence requirements24.  The study warns that because state measures in trade and investment regimes are primarly geared towards liberalising trade and promoting investment, there is a risk of legal and policy incoherence and a need to prevent gaps in human rights and environmental protection25. The European Commission did not adopt these recomendations, despite demands to go further from NGOs26. Six years after the report came out, the Commission has done nothing to improve access to justice for the victims of abuse by EUbased companies.  The Commission continues to emphasise voluntary, business-driven initiatives to improve corporate behaviour. It has launched guidelines on how to deal with human rights issues in the extractive industries and in IT supply chains. Yet voluntary policies have hardly had any impact on companies' activities in these areas. This single-minded insistence on a voluntary approach was also clear in the EU's Multistakeholder Forum on CSR in February 2015, organised by the European Commission to discuss a possible renewed European strategy on CSR2.  UN NORMS FOR BUSINESSES  The UN Human Rights Norms for Business were approved in 2003 by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights28. They set out basic business obligations regarding human rights. The Norms state that States have the primary responsibilty to promote, protect and secure the fulfillment of human rights recognised in international law, including ensuring that transnational corporations and other business enterprises respect human rights, wherever they operate. While not a formal treaty, they provide a legal framework to address abuses. The text calls on companies to directly implement the Norms, and suggests that breaches can result in compensation for victims. The provisions are all drawn from existing international law and standards.  Formal approval of the Norms has attracted opposition from a number of developed countries who oppose binding obligations for companies. EU members of the UN Commission were: Netherlands, France, Sweden, Austria, Italy, UK, Austria and Ireland. The fiercest opposition has come from the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Organisation of Employers (IOE) which stated that the Norms would divert the attention and resources of national governments away from implementing their existing obligations on human rights. This is unconvincing as businesses, and indeed the European Commission, seem to have plenty of time to negotiate new trade agreements. Being accountable to human rights should not be optional for businesses.  The Norms were not adopted by the UN Commission on Human Rights in April 2004, who made it clear that the norms did not have legal standing29.  From the start of discussions on the proposal for a binding treaty in September 2013 the EU has done everything it can to derail the process. After the Resolution had been adopted, the EU tried to delay and obstruct progress36, seeking to undermine the treaty process. For example, the EU demanded as a condition for participation that the scope of the proposed Treaty should cover all companies. While this sounds principled, it is not at all in line with what the EU does at home, where it regularly excludes a large part of companies from different new legislation. For instance, legislation on non-financial reporting by companies exempts small and medium size (SME) companies. Given that the EU is home to a large number of transnational corporations involved in human rights violations around the world, the attitude of the EU and its member states (and also the US) raises concern. If the EU does not sign the Treaty, many corporations would not be covered by this new human rights protection. The European Commission and member states argue that the proposed binding treaty undermines implementation of the voluntary UN Guiding Principles (UNGP). This argument is also supported by Norway and the business community37.  UN GUIDING PRINCIPLES (UNGP) The UNGP were established in 2011 by the UN Human Rights Commission. They were hailed as a way to bridge the governance gap between legislation estblished at the national level and companies operating at an international level. The European Commission was particularly enthusiastic and brought its own CSR policy in line with the UNGPs. The Commission also encouraged member states to develop National Action Plans for the implementation of the UNGPs at national level. Even though the EU and its member states argue that the UN treaty would endanger the implementation of the UNGPs, only seven out of 28 member states have adopted a National Action Plan (NAP) since 201138. These, and the Commission's own ""Staff Working Document on implementing the UNGPs - State of Play"" lack ambition and fail to include concrete proposals to address the lack of corporate accountability or the obstacles to accessing justice for the victims of corporate abuse.  EU POSITION ON UN BINDING TREATY ON BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS September 2013: the Government of Ecuador deliveres a statement on behalf of 85 member states of the United Nations (UN) at Human Rights Council (UNHRC) asking for a legally binding framework to regulate the activities of transnational corporations and to provide appropriate protection, justice and remedies for the victims of human rights abuses.  2013 EU permanent mission in Geneva gathers members to agree on forming a block to vote against the resultion 30.  EU permanent mission in Geneva threathens that it will not cooperate if the treaty will be adopted.  2014  Resolution , adopted on 26th of June 201431, calls for the elaboration of a legally binding instrument on TNCs with respect to human rights. In 2015 and 2016 the openended intergovernmental working group (IGWG) will discuss content, scope, nature and form of the treaty.  In July 2015 first IGWG session, with invited legal experts who gave their opinion on what such a treaty should look like in terms of scope and content.  After the vote, in autumn 2014, EU permanent mission in Geneva sets complicated conditions that needed to be met as a condition to attend IGWG session32.  2015 March 2015 Resolution of the European Parliament calling on the EU and its member states to engage in the emerging debate on a legally binding international instrument on business and human rights within the UN system33.  On the first day of the meeting, the EU representative in Geneva delayed the debate process by putting two new conditions on the table while discussing the work plan34. EU representative and member states are silent during the discussions on the Treaty's substance, and leave the room on day two. Eight out of 28 member states joined the EU delegation on the first day, and only France had one observer throughout the meeting.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The European Commission and its member states have been aggressively working towards establishing the rights for corporations so they can operate outside their borders. With the inclusion of special rights for foreign investors in trade agreements, multinationals have almost unlimited opportunities to defend their interests, regardless of human rights law or the sovereignty of national states to develop environmental and social policies. Yet the EU is failing to address the lack of access to justice for affected people and those who defend human rights, including in cases involving European companies. While rights for investors are guaranteed and enforceable in law, with special protection through the exclusive ISDS mechanism, citizens and affected communities are only protected by voluntary guidelines and have to depend on nonfunctioning grievance mechanisms that lack any effective sanctions and enforcement. To live up to its own commitments on human rights. The European Commission and EU member states should: · Work constructively towards the adoption of a binding UN Treaty on business and human rights and promote strong, legally binding and enforceable international agreements on human rights and environmental protection that ensure corporate accountability and access to justice for victims; · Refrain from including investment rights and ISDS mechanisms (or a reformed proposal such as the investment court) in any new trade or investment agreements; · Remove ISDS from all existing trade and investment agreements.

FoE-2016-4.txt," TAX HAVENS AND FINANCING CLIMATE ACTION INTRODUCTION This report is the technical report that supports Friend of the Earth International's summary report with recommendations and general analysis, also entitled `'. To obtain a copy of this report please visit  WHAT IS THE AIM OF THIS ANALYSIS? The aim of this analysis is purely to calculate an investment cost of providing several regions of the developing world with 100% renewable electricity, and to compare those amounts with goverment revenue lost through tax havens globally, in order to highlight the need for economic and climate justice. All values are in 2014 US dollars unless otherwise specified. It is important to note that the investment cost, representing the additional investment in renewables over and above what will occur anyway, does not represent the economic cost to society. Investments in power generation are paid back over time through sales of electricity. Friends of the Earth International believe that access to energy is a basic human right and a necessary condition of a dignified life. Greenpeace's Energy [R]evolution 20151 has analysed in detail the entire costs of continuing to rely on fossil fuel energy up to 2050, compared to switching to 100% renewables. They have found that overall, the cost to society of the 100% renewables option is cheaper than continued fossil fuel dependence. Renewable power may be more capital-intensive than fossil fuel power, but fossil fuels have ongoing fuel costs, so the savings in avoided fuel costs pay off the higher upfront investment in renewables. We have calculated for 100% renewable energy (electricity generation) by 2030 to demonstrate that an energy revolution to tackle climate change is achievable and the financial means exist. WHAT IS THE BASELINE SCENARIO? The International Energy Agency's (IEA) World Energy Outlook 2014 (WEO 2014)2 has been used as the base data set underlying this analysis. The IEA is considered one of the most authoritative bodies on global energy issues, working as an entity of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which are collectively the wealthiest countries on the planet. They collect data on energy use and project future trends for the entire globe. The World Energy Outlook 2014 projects that globally, $20 trillion of investment is required in power generation and transmission infrastructure to 2040 to meet future power demand.   WHAT COUNTRIES ARE BEING CONSIDERED? The IEA supplies data in the WEO 2014 in country groupings classified by geographical regions and membership of OECD, with individual data provided for a handful of major countries. We are interested in non-OECD countries for our analysis. The countries/country groupings for which the IEA provides data are shown in Figure 1.  Region classifications Africa Latin America Other Asia China Eastern Europe/Eurasia Middle East OECD, Antarctica Figure 1 WEO 2014 non-OECD country groupings. Further specificity is provided for OECD country groupings and selected major countries but is omitted here for simplicity. This analysis chooses to focus on Latin America, Africa and `Other Asia' - non-OECD countries Asia (also excluding China). A full list of every country in each region studied in this analysis is provided in Appendix I. Note that as Chile and Mexico are members of the OECD, the IEA includes its data in the OECD Americas grouping, so we are not including Chile and Mexico in our analysis. Furthermore this 2016 updated version of  includes the costing for `India' within the `Other Asia' category. This is a modification from the original 2015 report and IEA groupings, and any differences in the costings is a result of this addition.  FOR THE 1%  $600 BILLION ANNUALLY FOR?   WHAT TAX HAVEN DATA ARE WE USING? Tax havens or `secrecy jurisdictions' are jurisdictions, which allow people or businesses to minimise and escape the amount of taxes they pay on substantial economic activity occurring in a territory.3 There is often a distinction made between tax evasion, typically through undeclared offshore assets, which provide secrecy for individuals or entities to avoid paying tax, and `corporate tax havens', which adopt particular rules that allow corporations to avoid paying tax through profit shifting in various forms. For the purposes of this report, the term `tax haven' will reference to both general types of tax evasion and avoidance, both corporate and individual. There is much debate about the exact amount of global tax revenue lost through the use of tax havens for evasion and avoidance. This is due to fragmented data at both national and international levels, and the fact that these phenomena are deliberately hidden. Yet it is clearly a very substantial amount of money that undermines public budgets and service delivery, particularly for countries in the global south. Researchers at the IMF recently estimated the long-term, total global tax losses to corporate tax avoidance at roughly $600bn per year.4 A study from the Tax Justice Network (TJN) found that profit shifting by US multinationals alone resulted in around $130bn of revenue losses globally in 2012.5 If scaled up on the assumption that US multinationals are no more or less aggressive on tax than other multinationals, the TJN estimate implies total losses of around $650bn a year ­ roughly consistent with the IMF findings. In addition, it is estimated that $190bn of revenue is lost annually due to tax evasion from the non-declaration of assets hidden offshore ­ that is, in tax havens.6 That gives a potential global revenue loss, due to the secrecy of tax havens, of as much as $790 billion. The findings of this study are modelled on a scenario in which global tax revenue loss continues at the same level over the next 15 years. Friends of the International calculates the extra investment required to power half the world with 100% renewable energy is an average of $507 billion per year over the 15 year period. This is well below the estimates for tax revenue lost through tax havens annually, as noted above.   WHAT TYPE OF ENERGY TRANSFORMATION DO WE ENVISION? This report outlines the costs of meeting predicted energy demand with 100% renewable energy to certain parts of the global south. While the technical feasibility of this vision is important, it is imperative that renewable energy policy is guided by certain principles which guarantee a just and sustainable energy system for all.6 Energy is a necessary condition for a dignified life. We need energy for fuel and electricity to cook our food, to have habitable homes and workplaces in hot and cold places, to ensure that everyone has access to basic services like health and education, to communicate and travel and to share and access information via the internet. Yet according to the IEA, nearly 1.2 billion people ­ or one fifth of the world's population ­ do not have access to electricity.7 The current global energy system ­ the way we produce, distribute and consume energy ­ is unsustainable, unjust and harming communities, workers, the environment and the climate. This is fundamentally an issue of corporate and elite interests outweighing the rights of ordinary citizens and communities. When we refer to 100% renewable energy in this report we envision it prioritises and adheres to the following principles: 1. PROVIDES ENERGY ACCESS FOR ALL AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT Access to energy is a basic human right and a necessary condition of a dignified life. Everyone will have access to sufficient sustainable, clean, safe, affordable, reliable and appropriate energy to meet their energy requirements for a dignified life. This means adequate energy for: · lighting, heating and cooking · ensuring clean water supplies for adequate sanitation · ensuring access to essential public services like hospitals and schools · pumping water for irrigation and to run small-scale agricultural industries and other small businesses · communication, entertainment, and climate-safe recreation. 2. CLIMATE-SAFE AND BASED ON LOCALLY-APPROPRIATE, LOW-IMPACT TECHNOLOGIES Energy will be generated from climate-safe sources with low social and environmental impacts. This means no energy sources that: · are high carbon or produce significant quantities of other dangerous greenhouse gas emissions through their production, combustion, distribution, or the direct or indirect land use change that they give rise to abuse the rights of local communities and Indigenous Peoples · result in deforestation or forest degradation · result in the production of toxic waste · result in significant air, land or water pollution · deplete non-renewable resources. Energy technologies will also be appropriate to the needs of the communities who are using them and to their local and regional environmental, economic, social and cultural contexts. 3. UNDER DIRECT DEMOCRATIC CONTROL AND GOVERNED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST Energy is a common good. In a just energy system energy infrastructure and resources are therefore under direct democratic control. Decisions about the production and use of energy: · are democratic, participative, open and accountable · prioritise social outcomes, including energy access, fairness, environmental sustainability, and dignified work · are governed by the principle of subsidiarity, with decisions delegated to the most local and least centralised level possible, while also allowing for sub-regional, national and regional planning and coordination · give adequate power to all directly-affected groups to influence decisions, including energy users, energy sector workers, and people who are excluded from energy systems · respect the rights of communities to define their energy needs and how these needs are met in accordance with their cultures and ways of life, as long as these choices do not have destructive impacts on other people and communities. 4. ENSURES THE RIGHTS OF ENERGY SECTOR WORKERS, AND THEIR INFLUENCE OVER HOW THEIR WORKPLACES ARE RUN Workers involved in all aspects of the energy system are assured of their basic rights, including the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, a living wage, safe, secure and dignified work, and influence over how energy infrastructure is developed and run. 5. ENSURES THE RIGHT TO FREE, PRIOR AND INFORMED CONSENT AND RIGHTS OF REDRESS FOR AFFECTED COMMUNITIES The construction of new energy infrastructure will be done on the basis of the free, prior and informed consent and appropriate compensation / remuneration of affected communities and will respect the other rights of Indigenous Peoples and affected communities, and customary law. The same holds for the extraction of any material inputs needed to build energy infrastructure and develop and produce energy technologies. 6. AS SMALL-SCALE AND DECENTRALISED AS POSSIBLE Energy infrastructure, including supply and distribution, will be decentralised as much as possible. This is the case where energy solutions come from local opportunities at both small and community scale, and where energy is generated at or near the point of use, and either connected to a local distribution network system, supplying homes and offices rather than the high-voltage transmission system, or as stand-alone systems entirely separate from the public network. Decentralisation will help ensure energy access for people in remote and rural areas; will facilitate subsidiarity and community or local ownership and control; and will reduce energy wastage in distribution because energy and heat will be produced close to the point of use. Some large-scale renewable energy infrastructure such as large-scale wind or concentrated solar energy may be needed to complement decentralised supply to large towns and cities and essential public services and infrastructure. However, decision making over any such large-scale infrastructure will be subject to the democratic and participative decision-making process set out above, and subject to rigorous testing to ensure that measures to reduce energy dependence have already been exhausted and that the end use of the energy produced has high social importance or value.   7. ENSURES FAIR AND BALANCED ENERGY USE, REDUCED DEPENDENCE AND MINIMUM ENERGY WASTE Energy use is broadly fair and balanced globally and within countries, economical, and with minimum energy waste. 8. REDUCES ENERGY DEPENDENCE Reducing energy dependence and energy consumption does not have to mean a drastic reduction in living standards for ordinary people, although it will have to mean limits on excessive energy use from very energy-intensive activities. Increasing energy efficiency and regulating energy-intensive industries: Reducing energy dependence also necessitates efforts to increase energy efficiency. The IEA estimates that four fifths of the potential to reduce energy demand in the buildings sector and half of the potential to reduce demand in industry remains untapped. Some of the most important energy-savings options include improving heat insulation and building design, improving the efficiency of electrical machines, replacing old electric heating systems with renewable heat production, and reducing energy consumption by goods and passenger vehicles. It is important to recognise however, that energy efficiency does not automatically lead to reduced energy demand or reduced energy dependence overall. The transformation of our energy system will also require us to look at energy-intensive industries such as aluminium, steel, chemicals, cement and car production and ask what place these industries have in a sustainable economy and how they need to be transformed at their core, not just improved with energy-efficiency measures. Hence, while energy efficiency is important, it is not a solution by itself. Energy-savings measures must be integrated into a far bigger rethink of how to completely transform our economies towards sustainability and away from energy dependence. WHAT ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION ARE WE PROJECTING? Per-capita electricity consumption varies significantly across the countries being considered here, and of course would vary significantly amongst the population of individual countries as well. This analysis focuses on electricity only, and does not extend to other forms of energy consumption such as transport and heating. Electricity consumption is closely correlated with economic growth and income levels. Any future projections must entail a set of assumptions around the scale and type of economic activity and population growth. It raises questions of equity within and across societies. What changes in policies and societal priorities could change the projected outcomes? We use the WEO 2014 projections of future electricity consumption ­ also referred to as electricity or power demand ­ by region as our baseline, as an internationally-recognised standard, and seek to determine how that same level of demand might be met using renewable energy. We note that the IEA projections of per-capita energy use for 2030 still have some parts of the world remaining at relatively lower levels of energy usage. However, any other modelling was beyond the scope of this study, and as noted above, we believe a 100% renewable energy future must prioritize access to energy for all, community control and reduced energy dependence. Furthermore, this report aims to highlight existing inequality by providing a high level comparison of renewable energy investment costs against figures of concentrated global wealth. WHAT WOULD A FULLY RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM LOOK LIKE? RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES There are a range of technologies available to provide reliable renewable electricity, outlined below. This report seeks to predict the cost of a 100% renewable energy system. The energy mix presented is based on regional renewable energy generation capacity factors, however it is only a general overview that represents one possible scenario. It is the right of communities and in some cases, governments and other stakeholders, to determine their own locally appropriate renewable energy mix. VARIABLE RENEWABLES ­ VAST RESOURCES, DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS Power from the wind and the sun are set to become the primary energy sources for society in the 21st century. The potential from these resources is vast, eclipsing many times over humanity's entire current energy use. As their availability does change with the weather, a different set of strategies is required (as compared to fossil fuels) to ensure these sources can meet our needs. WIND POWER Wind power is one of the most mature renewable energy technologies. Wind power has been installed in over 80 countries, with 370GW of cumulative global capacity as of 20147. While it is variable, as power output fluctuates with wind speed, it can be used day or night and usually follows reliable patterns on a seasonal average basis. SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV) Solar PV is a fast-maturing renewable energy technology. As of 2014 it had reached 178GW of global capacity9. While solar PV performs best in direct sunlight, it is also able to produce some power from diffuse sunlight when clouds cover the sky. PV's modular nature allows it to be used at any scale from tiny panels producing enough power for a few small lights in a remote village, to utility-scale installations covering entire fields. Obviously solar PV can only generate electricity during the day unless coupled with batteries or other storage, and also follows reliable seasonal trends. CONCENTRATING SOLAR POWER (CSP) CSP is a different method of using the sun's energy to generate electricity. It uses combinations of mirrors to concentrate sunlight to heat fluids to high temperatures, which is then used to run steam turbine cycles similar to those used in conventional fossil and nuclear power plants. Some CSP technologies use molten salt as the operating fluid which can then be stored for later use in insulated tanks, thereby integrating very high efficiency energy storage into the power plant. CSP requires direct sunlight to operate, and while sunlight is only available during the day, plants with integrated storage can operate at night and through cloudy periods. CSP is a less mature technology and therefore more expensive than solar PV and wind, though with great potential to reduce in costs in the future. STORAGE ­ AN ESSENTIAL COMPLEMENT TO WIND AND SOLAR There are many ways of storing energy for later use. This analysis will use the characteristics and costs for several representative energy storage technologies, however it is entirely possible and likely that with future technological development, other types of storage will become available and cost-effective. While CSP-integrated thermal storage is useful in areas that have a high enough direct sunlight resource for CSP, the other technologies listed here can be used in different situations.   BATTERIES A range of battery technologies for use with renewables are maturing and reducing in costs. Recent analysis of current trends suggests batteries will cost $250/kWh (or less) by 2020, and $150-200/kWh by 203010,11. These costs could be realised earlier and reduced further, but these assumptions are used as a conservative expectation for this analysis. Battery systems, similar to solar PV, are modular and scaleable ­ they can be sized to supply a single dwelling, a community, a large commercial factility, or be integrated into the electricity grid. They are well-suited to the decentralised energy model that will likely play a large role in the global south. There are also a range of types of batteries using different materials at various stages of development, with many offering great potential. PUMPED HYDRO ENERGY STORAGE (PHES) Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) is the most widespread form of grid-scale electricity storage world-wide, and is a mature technology. It consists of simply pumping water up an upper reservoir with excess/cheap electricity, and later using this water to generate power with standard hydro turbines, released to a lower reservoir or body of flowing water, or even the ocean in the case of saltwater PHES. Conventional large hydro dams rivers to create very large reservoirs ­ capable of holding enough water to generate power for weeks to months. Unlike this, PHES systems built to store enough water several hours worth of generation are much smaller. The reservoirs can be artificially constructed with shallow walls without damming an existing water catchment, and can be sited to avoid ecologically sensitive areas. A system capable of providing 500MW of power for 10 hours, with 100 metres height difference between reservoirs, would need an upper reservoir 30 metres deep and 1km in diameter (if a circular footprint is used). A review of PHES technology and status in 2014 found that system costs of well-sited PHES facilities could be in the order of $200-300/kWh12. Costs will vary from site to site due to different topographical and civil engineering issues, but this still means that the more affordable PHES sites offer a cheap, large-scale energy storage solution with relatively low environmental impact. OTHER RENEWABLES ­ DISPATCHABLE BUT MORE RESOURCE LIMITED The renewable energy sources in this section are generally limited due to geographic and ecological constraints. They are not directly dependent on the daily availability of sun or wind to provide power (though hydropower and bioenergy do depend on seasonal weather patterns). They can draw on reserves of potential energy (subterranean heat, stored water or stockpiled biomass) to generate power on demand ­ dispatchable power. GEOTHERMAL POWER There are a range of different methods for using the heat naturally created within the Earth's core for useful purposes. In areas where the local geology allows relatively easy access to high temperatures, usually along geological fault lines, geothermal electricity has been generated for decades. For example, 25% of Iceland's electricity comes from geothermal power, though as they also use geothermal heat directly to heat buildings, it accounts for 66% of Iceland's total primary energy use13. In parts of the world which have suitable resources (Figure 2), there is the potential to significantly expand the use of geothermal power. Geothermal power can reliably generate electricity constantly, regardless of weather or seasons. HYDRO Hydro power from large mega-dams causes severe ecological and social problems. Hence this analysis explicitly chooses to consider a future without building any more large hydro dams, which we consider included in the definition of dirty and harmful energy. The continued use of existing hydro facilities has been factored in to help meet demand as a generator of last resort, as it is often used in conventional power markets today. BIOENERGY Due to a range of ecological and social reasons, we do not see bioenergy as an energy source to be used extensively for power generation. We have not factored in any more bioenergy than the small amounts projected by the IEA in each region. There is a small role for bioenergy alongside existing hydro to meet the final few percent of electricity demand, helping to get through particularly low periods of wind and solar.  It should be noted that in many rural parts of the developing world, biomass from traditional sources ­ woodcutting, animal dung etc ­ is already the main source of energy for heat and cooking. The use of wind and solar power to mostly replace traditional bioenergy use will help to reduce overall levels of biomass harvesting.  A NOTE ON ENERGY SOURCE VERSUS ENERGY SYSTEM Although we have listed several energy sources which are renewable and could be part of a sustainable and just energy future, we reiterate that our planet and its people need a much bigger transformation than merely a switch of the energy source. Only considering an energy source switch, rather than a deeper energy system transformation, involves some serious pitfalls. Some of these pitfalls to be mindful of include15: 1. Corporations will try to define what constitutes `renewable energy', 2. Construction of renewable energy infrastructure could drive land grabbing, enclosures, 3. Human rights abuses and environmental destruction, land grabbing, environmental destruction and human rights abuses from raw material extraction for renewable energy infrastructure, 4. Greenhouse gas emissions from the rollout of renewable technologies, 5. Poor environmental and labour standards in renewable energy technology manufacturing, 6. The renewable transition becoming a Trojan horse for energy privatisation, 7. Lack of public consent for renewable energy.  These pitfalls can be addressed and avoided only if the transition to renewables is carried out fairly, in a consultative manner, with a whole of supply chain approach to social and environmental sustainability.    HOW WOULD IT WORK? The main question arising when considering how a country could run primarily on renewable electricity is variability ­ how to use power sources which depend on the wind and sun to meet electricity demand which depends on human patterns of behaviour. A variety of studies from all over the world have looked at this very question16. They have generally found that renewable energy can provide most or all of a country or region's electricity needs, by using a number of strategies: 1. Using a portfolio of different types of renewable energy technologies, which have different production characteristics. 2. Generating more electricity than is required to make sure that there is enough even at times of low production. 3. Using energy storage. 4. Connecting renewable power plants across a wide geographical area, taking advantage of different weather patterns. 5. Changing how electricity is used to better fit with production from renewables. 6. Using power from non-weather dependent dispatchable sources. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM ANALYSES OF HIGH PENETRATION RENEWABLES SCENARIOS? In recent years there have been a number of very detailed studies into how electricity systems can operate with high penetrations of renewables. These have modelled the production and consumption of electricity on an hourly basis across many years of data, using actual electricity demand data from existing grids. Meteorological models providing wind speed and solar radiation data have allowed the teams to model the power output of new wind and solar installations that would need to be built to provide electricity in their high-penetration scenarios. Several of these studies have been used to inform the assumptions for this study. USING A COMBINATION OF STRATEGIES TO PROVIDE 100% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY FOR EUROPE Rasmussen et al (2012)17 used a similar method modelling hourly demand, solar and wind output, across 27 European countries. They then sequentially analysed how using a number of different strategies could increase the proportion of demand that can be met by variable renewables. They assumed unconstrained transmission in their scenarios. STORAGE WITH OVERGENERATION Trying to meet 100 TWh/yr of demand by generating exactly 100 TWh/yr of renewable electricity is very difficult, as it would require that every unit of electricity generated in excess of demand at one time is stored, potentially for a long time, for eventual later use. Rasmussen et al show that combining the use of storage with overgeneration ­ that is, generating more renewable electricity than demand ­ dramatically reduces the amount of storage required to achieve a fully renewable system. Figure 3, taken from the Rasmussen et al paper, shows this clearly. With an average Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) generation of 1.25 times annual average demand, the amount of storage required drops by over 80%. STORAGE SIZE The next stage of analysis looked at what size of storage is most useful. For the European scenario studied, it was found that a storage size equivalent to 6 hours of average demand was sufficient to smooth out most variability over the day/night cycle. Beyond this size there were strongly diminishing returns. A system with 25% overgeneration and 6 hours of storage was capable of meeting 97% of annual demand. The last 3% is due to  rare periods when both solar and wind generators have low output for a number of days in a row, and providing short-term storage capable of meeting all of these possible scenarios would be difficult, hence the diminishing returns. However it should be noted that this `optimum level' of 6 hours storage is for the scenario with 60% wind / 40% solar in Europe, as Europe generally has a good wind resource but a poor solar resource. The authors note that if the grid was trying to run primarily on solar energy, more storage would be needed, up to 12 hours for a 100% solar grid. This is because storage plays a more important role for smoothing the day/night cycle of solar, whereas wind power blows both day and night and storage smooths this production out over a shorter timescale.  DISPATCHABLE RENEWABLES   There are of course other renewable electricity technologies which can flexibly generate power on-  the proportion from wind of total renewable generation, with solar as the remainder.  demand, such as hydropower, biomass combustion  and geothermal. However the scale of these  technologies is more limited than that of wind and solar, due to the need for specific geography in the case of hydro  and geothermal, and competition with other demands in the case of biomass. These technologies have a role to  play in a renewable energy future by balancing wind and solar, and will likely be mostly used in enabling the final  few percent of a 100% renewable grid to be achieved. Hydro power systems are often used today as the `generator  of last resort' in power grids with bid-in power markets, where hydro generation is used on rare occasions when  conventional generators are struggling to meet peak demand. Due to the many ecological and social problems  caused by hydropower from large scale dams this analysis chooses to consider a future without building any more  large hydro dams.  Rasmussen et al next took into account the electricity currently provided by existing hydro power systems in Europe, equivalent to 4.6% of the annual demand. When this was included in the model, essentially meaning that solar, wind and storage only needed to provide 95.4% of demand, the fully renewable system was achieved more easily, requiring only half the amount of overgeneration.    THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INCREASED TRANSMISSION In the regions of the developing world looked at in this analysis, existing transmission interconnections between countries are unlikely to be as available as Europe. The studies referenced below find that · while better transmission to link up wide geographical regions does help enable renewables to meet more of electricity demand,    · even with no or low levels of transmission it is still possible for renewables to meet a large portion of demand (in the absence of other strategies like storage and overgeneration), and · the incremental benefits of significantly enhanced transmission links are relatively small, with diminishing returns. Becker et al (2014)18 modelled a high penetration of wind and solar photovoltaic power in the lower 48 states of the USA, divided into 10 regions specified by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Rodriguez et al (2014)19, performed a similar analysis across 30 European countries. These specifically looked at effect of geographic dispersion by considering individual member countries or regions, with and without various levels of transmission. These studies did not include storage in their analysis, and assumed that at times when renewable generation is insufficient, flexible (dispatchable) generation can be used to meet the shortfall ­ much like fossil gas turbines are used today. The amount of electricity generated from wind and solar was specified as equal to the grid demand, on an annual average basis ­ which is actually a worst case scenario for sizing a renewable grid (see Figure 3). However as no storage was employed, at times when wind and solar production was in excess of grid demand it was wasted, while at times when it was less than grid demand backup power was used. The key variable being sought was ""what proportion of grid demand can be met by wind and solar over a whole year"". The results are given in Table 3.  These results are useful for understanding the benefits of linking up renewables over a large geographical area via transmission interconnection. These studies indicate that the incremental improvements in investing in greater transmission are part of the solution to creating renewable electricity grids. However it is instructive that 67-80% of demand can be met by renewables without storage or overgeneration in the absence of a large transmission grid in the European study ­ each country was modelled as its own separate grid. A theoretically unconstrained transmission grid increased this by only 9 percentage points to 85%. The U.S. study had broadly similar findings. Another finding worth noting is that preliminary results of an Australia-wide renewables modelling study indicates that clustering wind farms in 4 main areas across the continent provides a similar benefit (in terms of diversity of resource) to wind farms scattered individually20. This suggests that the benefits of geographical diversity can be gained with a targeted approach to transmission. DIFFERENCES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD There are important ways in which the renewable electricity future in the developing world may be quite different from that in Europe and the United States. These include: · The regions of the world that this study focuses on have different solar and wind resources. · Developing countries may not have, presently or in the future, an extensive transmission grid. · Demand management and current reliability.   RENEWABLE RESOURCE COMPARISON On the first point, a high level look at global solar and wind resources on the maps on the following pages gives some insight. Figure 4 shows average wind speeds across the world, which correlates with power output of wind turbines. Figure 5 shows solar resource measured as Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI). GHI is a measurement of both direct sunlight and diffuse sunlight ­ scattered sunlight which is present even with cloud cover ­ which is useable by solar photovoltaics, as falling on a plane horizontal to the Earth's surface. Figure 6 shows Direct Normal Irradiation21, which measures only the direct portion of sunlight, as falling on a plane which precisely tracks and matches the angle of the sun over the course of the day. DNI is the relevant resource to consider for Concentrating Solar Power plants. These maps have been created with data supplied by Vaisala/3Tier, a global renewable energy consulting company22. The windspeed data shows that the developing regions considered in this study have generally a similar or worse wind resource than Europe and the contiguous United States. The regions close to the equator have a very poor wind resource, while it is generally better away from the equator. The solar data shows that these same developing regions considered have generally a superior solar resource to Europe and the US. Even South-East Asia and other equatorial regions which have a somewhat lower DNI resource due to cloud cover still receive enough total GHI to have a comparable or higher solar potential to southern Spain. Away from the equator the solar resource is comparable or significantly higher than the south-west United States. This suggests that the regions in this study will benefit from a higher share of solar in their renewables mix than wind, a reversal of the results of the European and US studies. LARGE GRIDS OR SMALL? In Africa there exists today a large number of transmission interconnections between countries across the continent (see Figure 6). However it is possible and indeed likely that rural parts of the world without any grids currently may need to `leapfrog' conventional fossilised electricity grids, and use small-scale micro-grids with localised renewable energy sources. This approach has great potential because renewables, particulary solar PV, are modular so can gradually be added to as a community is able to afford more energy. The concept of `climbing the solar ladder'23 envisages communities starting with solar lanterns to replace kerosene lamps, to small solar panel & battery systems able to provide a house with energy after dark, to community ­ level microgrids also able to power labour-saving machines such as grain milling, sewing machines and other enterprises that will generate income. When it becomes more affordable there are benefits to joining an electricity network with more diverse generation, and the potential to aggregate storage. It is likely that the renewable future of the regions in this study will have a more significant role for micro-grids than that which exists in developed nations today, but still incorporate large-scale and decentralised grid-connected power sources, especially to supply large urban areas with electricity (note that small-scale renewable generation can also be grid-connected). It is not within the scope of this study to specifically prescribe how the mix between these options will play out. Significant investments in new and upgraded transmission will be required both for a renewable and a fossil fuel future. Out of the $20 trillion the IEA projects will be spent on all new power infrastructure worldwide to 2040, $8.7 trillion of this is on transmission alone. The IEA estimates only 4% of this is needed specifically to integrate renewables into the grid24. Estimating whether or how much extra transmission would be required in a fully renewable future would also need to account for transmission investments that would have occurred anyway ­ to connect new fossil and nuclear power plants, and supply buildings and communities that are not currently on the grid with new connections. The complexity of this exercise is beyond the scope of this study, and as such we do not include any extra transmission costs in our results. RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT Many parts of the developing world that are connected to the electricity grid today do not receive power with the same reliability as a grid in more developed countries, which are typically tightly regulated to ensure greater than 99.99% of demand is met. In contrast, rolling blackouts are a commonly used method of `demand management' in developing countries, with particular towns, or parts of cities, receiving power only on some days, or for limited hours per day. The electricity grids are less likely to be well-maintained, increasing the occurrences of unexpected power outages. Increased use of decentralised renewable energy is likely to offer a significant improvement in the current situation in many places.   `Demand management' is a practice often discussed in developed countries in the context of dealing with extreme situations for the electricity grid ­ dealing with the highest peak demand by arranging for some industrial facilities to temporarily shut down, or timing hot water systems and pool pumps only to operate at off-peak times. Using strategies like these to time-shift electricity demand by a few hours will likely play an important role in a renewable future, by using more power at times of high wind and solar output, and using less at times of low output. It may be that in developing countries demand management is easier to implement due to different existing expectations of the availability of grid electricity.   METHODOLOGY Detailed hourly modelling is beyond the scope of this study. Based on principles derived from the results of the European and US studies, and making conservative assumptions, we specify a high-level 100% renewable electricity generation scenario for several regions of the developing world. Detailed results and calculation steps can be found in Appendix II. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGY GENERATION AND DEMAND Demand for each region is calculated based on projected electricity demand in the WEO 201425. The WEO also gives electricity generation for each region26, which for 2012 is 12-22% greater than demand in the regions considered. This would be due to a number of factors, primarily · Own consumption in fossil and nuclear power plants, which have significant parasitic loads due to pumping and compressing heat transfer fluids. · Losses in transmission and distribution networks. Wind and solar PV technologies do not have the parasitic loads associated with fossil and nuclear power stations as their energy conversion mechanisms are simpler and more direct. Some transmission and distribution losses will remain, though are expected to reduce over time as network investment improves efficiency, and decentralised renewables are able to generate power close to the point of consumption. For our renewable scenario analysis, this generation in excess of demand is assumed to reduce by 50%, such that the final electricity generation requirements are 6-11% greater than the underlying demand across the regions studied. This new generation requirement is considered to be the final gross electrical demand for the purposes of our analysis. VARIABLE RENEWABLES VERUS DISPATCHABLE RENEWABLES Rasmussen et al showed that combined with some dispatchable renewables (hydro), variable renewables (solar and wind) combined with storage could meet 95% of demand. For our regions we will be satisfied with variable renewables meeting less than 90% of demand. Dispatchable renewables ­ hydro (only capacity already existing in 2012), geothermal and bioenergy will make up the remainder. While on the timescale of minutes to hours CSP with storage can be considered dispatchable, as its output is inherently dependent on the solar resource it is considered a variable renewable along with wind and solar PV for our analysis. RENEWABLES OVERGENERATION The final scenario in Rasmussen et al required a renewables generation of 112% of annual demand. Our scenarios will consider a renewables generation equal to 130% of annual demand. This excess overgeneration is a conservative assumption to allow for the fact that there will be real-world differences in renewable resources, transmission constraints and load profile between the regions we are studying, and the European scenario in Rasmussen et al. STORAGE Rasmussen et al modelled 6 hours of storage as the optimum for their European scenario. This scenario also found that approximately 60% of generation from wind was optimal due to the good wind resource and relatively poor solar resource of Europe. Their results of other mixes with higher solar shares find that more storage is required for scenarios with a higher proportion of solar, up to 12 hours of storage for a 100% solar grid. As the regions of focus in our study generally have a better solar resource and similar-to-worse wind resource than Europe, our scenarios use more solar and more storage ­ detailed in the following regional-specific analyses.  This storage is not specified in terms of scale or technology, as we are not specifying in detail the nature of these future renewable electricity supply systems. As discussed, a generic cost of $200-$250/kWh of storage capacity has been used. This could be off-grid batteries, grid-connected batteries, utility-scale storage such as pumped hydro energy storage or other storage technologies. The only exception is that CSP plants have been assumed to have 6 hours of storage integrated into them27. This has been accounted for in calculating remaining storage requirements. OFF-SHORE WIND AND LARGE VERSUS SMALL-SCALE SOLAR PV The IEA costings matrix28 allows for separate costings and annual capacity factor for offshore vs onshore wind, and large-scale vs small/building scale solar PV. Offshore wind is more expensive than onshore wind but can generate at higher capacity factors due to better wind resources offshore. We have assumed that 15% of wind power in each region is offshore. Large-scale solar PV will generally be grid-connected, while small-scale solar PV may or may not be grid connected. We assume that one-third of solar PV in our regions is large-scale, with the remaining two-thirds small scale.  REGION-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSIS   The continent of Africa has overall an excellent solar resource. Even in the equatorial regions which experience higher cloud cover, the solar GHI resource is among the best on the planet (see Figure 5 and Figure 8). Outside of this equatorial band, in most of the northern and southern areas of the continent, the DNI resource (most relevant to CSP technology) is among the best on the planet (Figure 6).  AFRICA ­ WIND RESOURCE  Like most continents, Africa has both regions with very high and very low wind power potential. Coastal areas in the far east, north-west and southern parts of the continent have particularly good wind resources (as well as pockets of the Saharan desert and northern Madagascar), while much of the equatorial part of the continent has quite poor average wind speeds. AFRICA ­ GEOTHERMAL AND HYDRO POWER  Figure 8 Solar energy resource (GHI) for Africa. Sources: see note Geothermal in Africa is likely to be located primarily in the Rift Valley region. Some parts of the continent have already tapped into hydro potential significantly, while other areas have not.  WHAT A RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE FOR AFRICA COULD LOOK LIKE The vision of a renewable energy future for Africa in this analysis is detailed in Table 4 and Figure 10, and would broadly consist of: · Solar PV distributed across the continent, in standalone systems, microgrids and grid-connected installations. · Some wind power, starting in southern African countries which already have stronger grids, as well as some in the more remote eastern and north-western parts of the continent which will require further transmission links. · CSP with storage in the northern and southern parts of the continent, providing important flexible balancing power to electricity grids. · Use of the existing hydro dams, an increase in geothermal capacity and a small amount of bioenergy to provide 12% of electricity from non-weather dependent renewable resources. · Storage equivalent to 10 hours of average demand. RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES IN LATIN AMERICA  LATIN AMERICA ­ SOLAR RESOURCE  As with Africa, the solar resource of South America is excellent. Most of the continent except for the southernmost region of Patagonia has a good solar GHI resource. The area with the highest DNI and therefore suitability for CSP is around the Atacama desert ­ taking in southern Peru, south-western Bolivia and north-western Argentina (see Figure 6).  LATIN AMERICA ­ WIND RESOURCE  The wind resource of Latin America varies extremely. Much of the Amazon, around the equator, has a very poor wind resource. There are pockets of good wind locations such as in Central America, the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America, and the eastern-most part of Brazil. This area of Brazil has over 7GW of wind power installed30 across over 250 windfarms31. In addition, Patagonia ­ which covers a large area of the southernmost part of the continent, has an excellent wind resource.  Figure 11 Solar energy resource (GHI) for Latin America. Source: see note LATIN AMERICA ­ HYDRO POWER  Hydro currently dominates the Latin American electricity supply, accounting for 61% of total power generation. Of this hydro capacity, 59% is located in Brazil. If no new dams are built, by 2030 hydro will still contribute 32% of projected electricity generation.  LATIN AMERICA ­ GEOTHERMAL POWER  The parts of Latin America where the potential for geothermal power is greatest ­ the north-west of South America, Central America and the Caribbean ­ are also the areas with less hydro capacity. This is useful as geothermal power will be able to play a balancing role with the more variable renewable resources.     WHAT A RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE FOR LATIN AMERICA COULD LOOK LIKE The vision of a renewable energy future for Latin America in this analysis is detailed in Table 5 and Figure 13, and would broadly consist of: · Solar PV in covering rooftops in cities, and in small microgrids in remote parts of the continent. · Wind power installed in the high wind speed regions. · Some CSP installations in regions with high DNI, though likely limited by environmental factors in the Atacama region. · Use of the large existing hydro systems, some increased geothermal capacity to provide 38% of generation from dispatchable renewable sources. · Storage equivalent to 6 hours of average demand.  OTHER ASIA  `Other Asia' includes Asian countries except for OECD Asian countries and China. The `Other Asia' category is a slight modification from the 2015  Report and IEA's country groupings, as it includes India. The differences in costing is a result of this addition. `Other Asia' is not a contiguous geographic region as with Africa and Latin America, but covers a number of dispersed regions. The IEA also includes the many small Pacific island states in this analysis, for which they estimate data in aggregate, and are not all shown on these maps due to scale. A full list of countries in each grouping can be found in Appendix 1 of the full report  RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES IN OTHER ASIA  OTHER ASIA ­ SOLAR RESOURCE  India, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries in this region likely to be suitable for concentrating solar power (CSP), as the DNI map in Figure 14 shows. Nepal has good solar resources but as it is mostly a mountainous country, suitable sites may be difficult to find except in the lowlands. However most of the Other Asia countries have a good solar GHI resource, including the Pacific Islands that are not shown well on the map in Figure 1. Many people in this region live in isolated communities ­ whether on the Mongolian steppe or rural Afghanistan, or small islands in south-east Asia and the Pacific. It is envisaged that small-scale solar and battery microgrids will play a significant role in providing electricity access for these regions.   OTHER ASIA ­ WIND RESOURCE Much of South-East Asia, particularly Indonesia, has quite a poor wind resource (Figure 15), though Mongolia, India, Afghanistan and Pakistan have better wind. There is currently a small but growing wind industry in South-East Asia, though resilience to tropical storms is an issue. It is envisaged that wind power will not play as significant a role as solar in south-east Asia's energy mix.  OTHER ASIA ­ GEOTHERMAL  Indonesia, the Philippines and parts of the Pacific have large geothermal energy potential. It is expected that geothermal will play a significant role in the energy mix of these countries, where it can play a similar role to hydro in providing firm balancing power to variable renewables.   WHAT A RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE FOR OTHER ASIA COULD LOOK LIKE The vision of a renewable energy future for Other Asia in this analysis is detailed in Table 6 and Figure 16, and would broadly consist of: · India alone would consume half of the projected energy demand for the region. India is suited to a mix of over 90% of its demand being met by around 30% each of wind, solar PV and solar CSP · Extensive use of small-scale, microgrid solar PV across the whole region. · Wind power mainly in Mongolia, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the pockets of good wind resource in South-East Asia. · CSP mainly in India, potentially also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. · Widespread use of geothermal in Indonesia and the Philippines. · Geothermal, hydro and bioenergy contribute 18% of annual demand. · Storage equivalent to 10 hours of average demand.  COSTING RESULTS  Investment costs have been calculated for each of the regions, for providing the renewable electricity systems outlined.  The investment costs are for the additional renewable energy capacity over and above the renewable energy capacity that would be built anyway under the IEA New Policies Scenario.  As hydro capacity is assumed to remain constant from 2012, we have calculated the cost of the additional hydro that would have been built under the IEA New Policies Scenario, and subtracted this from final figures for each region. This is because it represents investment in renewable energy that would occur anyway, but in our scenario would be redirected from hydro to other renewables.  Data on cost and capacity factor (a measure of annual energy output per unit of capacity) have been sourced directly from the relevant sections of the IEA's input assumptions for the World Energy Outlook 201432. Costs from  the 450 Scenario have been used as they represent a more rapid decrease in the costs of renewable energy  in a world which takes greater action to decrease the  use of fossil fuels.   For simplicity, a linear progression of building of additional renewable capacity is assumed. This is  slightly conservative because in practice an increasing  growth curve would occur, meaning that more capacity Table 7 Additional investment costs for achieving 100%  is built later in the period when costs are lower.

GGA-1.txt,"  The Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) is a collaborative  of over 40 community-based groups, alliances  and movement support organizations in Indigenous,  African American, Latin@, Asian Pacific Islander  and working class white communities. In 2013,  CJA launched the Our Power Campaign (OPC):  Communities United for a Just Transition, a national  effort uniting communities fighting fossil fuels and  other polluting industries around a common vision  and strategy—to transition the economy in ways  that reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the source,  restore equity, and put decision-making in the hands  of communities.    Grassroots Global Justice (GGJ) is an alliance of  59 US-based grassroots organizing (GRO) groups  organizing to build an agenda for power for working  and poor people and communities of color. GGJ  focuses on bringing GRO organizations into a  long-term process of relationship building, political  alignment and the development of transformational  leadership. The membership of GGJ adopted a  framework in 2011 that calls for a holistic approach  to building grassroots global justice: No War, No  Warming, Build an Economy for the People and the  Planet. We weave and bridge together US-based GRO  groups and global social movements working for  climate justice, an end to war, and a just transition  to a new economy that is better for people and the  planet. GGJ is a co-founder of CJA and the World  March of Women-US Chapter.    The Climate Justice Alliance (CJA) along with its staff, members, and allies served on the leadership team that  helped organize the historic People’s Climate March and a series of other events during the People’s Climate  Week, September 20-23, 2014.  Several groups that helped to organize the People’s Climate March have shared their stories and perspectives of  the march and how they helped to make it a reality. Many CJA members have read and appreciate the contributions  they’ve made to the historical record in the telling of their stories. Contained in the pages of this report is  the CJA story. It reflects our understanding, experiences, and analyses in the process of planning and organizing  the Climate Week mobilizations, actions and events. We also share lessons we’ve learned along the way. This  report is not meant to be a definitive account of the organizing process; rather to add our voices— the CJA  narrative—into the mix.  We invite you to read our story…  IT TAKES ROOTS TO  WEATHER THE STORM  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014:  A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY    A global economic system that relies on unbridled industrial growth,  exploitation of natural resources and people, and diminishing controls over  waste and pollution have brought us to a tipping point. The vast majority of  the world’s scientists confirm what we witness and experience every day—that  the health of the planet is in jeopardy and humans are to blame. False promises  of market-based solutions—for example, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation  and Forest Degradation (REDD), Climate Smart Agriculture, Sustainable  Energy for All—and costly technological fixes such as waste incineration are  being promoted by corporations and embraced by world leaders. At best, these  policies will not go far enough; at worst, they will reproduce the exploitative  practices that lead to even greater instability, inequality and harm to people  and the planet. As the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) 21st meeting of the Congress of Parties (COP) in Paris, France this  December approaches, it is becoming increasingly clear that the intransigence  and false promises of the world’s economic and political elites will not solve  climate change. A powerful, independent, diverse, global social movement is  needed to make the demands and take the bold actions required to make the  change we need.  Such a social movement is growing in the United States. Indigenous, African  American and other communities of color and working class communities have,  despite limited resources, effectively used grassroots organizing, alliance/  coalition building and direct action to win significant victories against polluting  industries; for example stopping the expansion of oil refineries, shutting down  waste and coal incinerators, and preventing life-of-mine permits from being  awarded, etc. Their campaigns have prevented massive amounts of new carbon  emissions from reaching the atmosphere. These communities have become  central to the leadership of a diverse, growing, mass-based climate movement  that is needed to win real change. The historic Climate Week and People’s  Climate March (PCM) in New York City in September, 2014 were important  steps in this direction.  WE ARE FACING AN ECOLOGICAL CRISIS OF EPIC PROPORTIONS. THIS MOMENT  AND OUR CURRENT CONDITIONS REQUIRE NOT ONLY NEW SOLUTIONS TO OLD  PROBLEMS, BUT ALSO NEW STRATEGIES, PATHWAYS AND RELATIONSHIPS TO BRING  ABOUT THE BOLD AND LASTING CHANGE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN LIFE AND HEAL  THE PLANET.  THE MOMENT AND THE MOVEMENT  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY Coordinated by a diverse Mobilization Support  Team1 (MST) of about a dozen local, regional and  national organizations, coalitions and alliances  with additional organizing support from a strong  local New York-New Jersey Host Committee,  dozens of organizing “hubs”  and ultimately over 1500 organizations,  the PCM was the  largest climate march and environmental  justice mobilization in  history. Approximately 400,000  people turned out on the streets  of Manhattan on September  21st to raise awareness of the  increasing urgency of climate change. One of  the largest delegations—approximately 19,000  members of the Climate Justice Alliance (CJA), plus  an estimated 20,000 people from allied grassroots  organizing groups—helped highlight how  low-income communities are hit first and worst by  the floods, droughts and storms and at the same  time are cultivating real solutions on the frontlines  of the crises; solutions that governments need  to follow. And it laid plain that huge numbers of  people believe the present federal policy approach  is insufficient to avert the crises we are facing. The  People’s Climate March also illustrated to the world  there is indeed a social movement for climate justice  growing in one of the countries most responsible  for the greatest ecological crises of our times.  The Climate Justice Alliance played a central role in  the planning of this historic People’s Climate March  (). The CJA was also key to organizing the  People’s Climate Justice Summit (-), had  a large contingent at the Flood Wall Street Action  (), sponsored the People’s Tribunal ()  and organized an action outside the United Nations  during the UN Climate Summit (). While  ensuring the success of the week, CJA was primarily  concerned with lifting up the visibility and voices  of frontline, Indigenous and communities of color  in the march, shifting the center of gravity of the  climate movement and strengthening the Alliance  itself. The overarching goals of CJA’s participation  in the planning and implementation  of this climate convergence were to:  • Build the Bigger We by strengthening  relationships with larger  national organizations, linking local  priorities to national and global  statements of solidarity and connect  our campaigns and struggles.  • Empower Communities and Local Climate  Justice Organizations by raising the visibility of  local, regional and national frontline fights; lifting  up place-based leadership and expertise; and  embedding issues of justice and equity at the core  of all emerging narratives and political strategies.  • Build CJA by mobilizing members from around the  country to participate in the mobilization as a CJA  contingent and aligning national gatherings from  Detroit to Richmond with the local organizing in  New York/New Jersey.  • Impact Policy in New York by shaping the  climate justice agenda of the New York City Mayor  and challenging the New York Governor to ban  fracking.  In addition, CJA leadership saw the opportunity to  build a political agenda around a “systems change”  analysis. CJA members and allies clearly articulated  the need to break from the current system of  over-exploitation, over-consumption, over-production  and extractivism and, in its place, implement the  diverse, place-based solutions, practices, methods  1 The central coordinating body for the PCM was the Mobilization Support  Team (MST), which included: 350.org, ALIGN, Avaaz, Blue Green Alliance,  Climate Justice Alliance, Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, New  York City Environmental Justice Alliance, Oil Change International, SEIU  Locals 32BJ and 1199, Sierra Club, and UPROSE. CJA member organizations  were core conveners and organizers of this mobilization: NYC-EJA was a  co-facilitator of the New York-New Jersey Host Committee, the main local  coordinating body for the PCM, which also included Ironbound Community  Corporation in Newark and UPROSE in Brooklyn (both CJA members).  PCM was the  largest climate  march and  environmental justice  mobilization in history.  4 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  2 In the Our Power movement the term Frontline Communities refers to  communities that are hit first and worst by climate, economic or other crises.  Our Power Campaign states: “Communities on the frontlines of climate  change are the ones cultivating real, place-based solutions to address the  global ecological crises… They are also organizing to stop pollution and  poverty at the source, confronting the root causes of the climate crisis.”  and systemic alternatives being created in frontline  communities.3 This was particularly important for  CJA in light of the PCM’s final agreement not to align  on specific demands in order to keep the message  general and prioritize a bigger tent. CJA’s leadership  in the planning and coordination of the People’s  Tribunal, the People’s Climate Justice Summit, the  PCM, and two aforementioned direct action demonstrations  also buttressed the efforts of its members  to build power, as they were able to leverage their  membership in CJA to reinforce local efforts. Finally,  organizing the PCM raised CJA’s level of visibility  and established its leadership, historical contributions,  and expertise on sources and impacts of  climate change and environmental justice. CJA is  now a recognized force in this movement that more  established or better-known organizations must  contend with moving forward.  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY 3 Mary Lou Malig, Burning the Planet, One Climate COP at a Time (/14)  The mobilizations, actions and other activities  held during the NYC Climate Week are considered  important events inside a much broader and  protracted movement aimed at addressing the root  causes of climate change and building up real community-  led solutions. A sober analysis of the historic  relationship between the national mainstream environmental  movement and the environmental  justice movements reveal the latter has struggled  for decades with various forms of racial, economic,  gender and now climate injustice both within the  movement and outside of it. The environmental  justice movement has nonetheless worked to lift up  the voices, the resilience and the bravery of frontline  communities while organizing to end harm against  these communities and the earth. And it has pushed  for new ways of relating with one another to bring  about greater impact and more substantial change.  We uphold the following values and practices toward  a strategy that can help us win:  1. A winning climate movement requires the  leadership of frontline communities most impacted  by health, environmental, racial and economic  injustices associated with the ecological crises.  Further, movement leaders must be guided by  a collective vision, a clear understanding of  the problem, tried and tested community-led  solutions, and strategies that move logically and  appropriately from problem to solution.3 The  articulation of problems and solutions must simultaneously  address crises in the economy,  democracy and climate. Finally, campaigns  addressing these intersecting crises must employ  a range of strategies and tactics that include  direct action, mobilizations, and policy advocacy.  2. A winning climate movement needs to be  broad-based, inclusive and diverse, reflecting all  those ultimately impacted by climate change.  It must possess a willingness to struggle through  differences to attain greater alignment around  strategies, politics and vision, not only among  mainstream environmental and environmental  justice groups in the movement, but also with  other sectors such as labor, youth, faith, economic  and racial justice, health professionals and more.  3. A winning climate movement must be guided  by a vision of systemic change that is place-based,  defined by local knowledge and safeguards for  human and ecological health. That vision must  be strong and cohesive with strategies that  build power to scale, power that is bottom-up  and rooted in frontline communities of practice.  Further, it must support and appropriately scale  up solutions; stop the harm from happening  (pollution, extraction, etc.); shift the minds,  hearts and practices of people around the world  to join in this struggle for human existence; and  build a strong strategic and compelling argument  articulated in a unified voice.  4. A winning climate movement must be resourced  collectively and equitably. Building a movement  like this requires sufficient material, non-material  and financial resources to support the capacity  of people and movement actors to organize,  implement real solutions, fight for systems  change, and build the systems, institutions and  processes that support this change.  5. A winning climate movement must link with  international allies and social movements for  greater solidarity and impact. The interconnectedness  of economic and political systems and the  transnational behavior of corporations requires  that movements calling for system-wide change  and greater government and corporate accountability  to humanity and the earth be connected in  strategic ways.  BUILDING  A WINNING CLIMATE MOVEMENT  6 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  6. A winning climate movement requires that mobilizations  and actions be strategically organized,  coordinated and timed to make key advances.  Climate Week activities and the collaborative  processes and coordination of the PCM gave us the  opportunity to practice and test these principles.  Their application impacted the overall outcome of  these activities, resulted in important movement  advances, and revealed valuable organizing lessons.  The PCM was timed to coincide with the United  Nations Climate Summit on September 23 in order  to challenge the increasing corporate takeover of UN  climate negotiations and the privatization of land,  water and air.4 Around the world, all eyes were on  the United Nations to hear what the nations’ leaders  were saying about climate. What they saw were  over 400,000 people representing a variety of allied  movements in the United States voicing concerns  over climate change. The March organizers sent a  clear message to the world that the people of the  United States are willing to take action on climate.  The PCM created space for frontline communities  to put forward a vision of local solutions, not just  highlight problems. It also helped to open political  space for victories to be won on climate policy5 and  set the foundation to begin transcending the existing  cultures of practice and relationships between  national environmental groups (henceforth “big  greens”) and environmental justice groups. The  march served as a great model of shared leadership,  capacity and resources. It created opportunities  for grassroots organizing and climate policy organizations  from the New York region and around  the country to collaborate in its planning, laying  the groundwork for an ongoing commitment to  building a broader, united U.S. climate movement.  Connections forged in recent years6 laid the basis for  relationships between groups that would not have  ordinarily worked together. This coming together  demonstrated a new willingness to build power for  a common cause and a new level of cooperation.  PCM organizers were able to see and experience on a  small scale what collaborative resourcing could look  like. Though an imperfect process—as it was new to  those involved—resources of all kinds were raised,  shared, passed on, etc. There was a demonstrated  commitment by all, including national allies, to  support frontline leadership and participation.  Finally, the PCM provided space for other movement  sectors in the United States to participate in the  march, elevate their voices and concerns and  demonstrate solidarity with others, including  student and youth, faith-based groups, immigrant  rights organizations, labor unions, health care professionals,  scientists and new constituencies who  are beginning to see themselves as part of a growing  popular movement on climate. Significantly, the PCM  provided space for the participation of international  allies not only in solidarity mobilizations around  the world, but also in all Climate Week activities and  actions. They testified in the Tribunal, facilitated  and spoke on panels in the People’s Climate Justice  Summit and participated in the Flood Wall Street  and United Nation actions.  4 See CJA’s Call to Action ().  Civil society has increasingly been pushed out of the UN  spaces by more restrictive rules on participation, while the presence of  businesses and corporations has grown substantially.  5 For example, according to Wes Gillingham of Catskill Mountainkeepers,  “the climate march was a vehicle for showing opposition to fracking. There  were a lot of signs about fracking there and good press connecting the  issue to the march. One article in the press mentioned fracking as the most  abundant of all signs. All of that added pressure to the governor to make a  decision based on political opinion across the state.” (email to I. Kilimanjaro  /15).  6 For example, several members of the Mobilization Support Team—  including staff from 350.org, CJA and Sierra Club—shared (in separate  interviews with I. Kilimanjaro) that the first Building Equity and Alignment  for Impact initiative started by the Overbrook Foundation was one of the  key spaces where cross-sector conversations paved the way for planning  around the PCM to take place.  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY   THE GENESIS  While early exchanges about a 2014 NYC climate  mobilization can be traced back to discussions in  a number of different movement circles, members  of Climate Justice Alliance had their first set of  exchanges during a couple of movement strategy  sessions held in the Summer and Fall of 2013. At  these gatherings—the Extreme Energy Extraction  Summit in Minnesota and the Common Ground  Collaborative in upstate New York—Tom Goldtooth  of the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN)  proposed that members of CJA and other grassroots  groups ask the big greens to support a climate justice  protest in NYC, led by Indigenous and environmental  justice/climate justice communities.”Then in early January 2014, “when CJA first learned  about the Ban Ki-Moon Summit, we [a group of  organizers inside CJA] had a discussion with the New  York City Environmental Justice Alliance (NYC-EA)  about the possibility of collaborating with 350.org  to mobilize a street protest around this event. 350.  org had already been in touch with Avaaz, the Sierra  Club and some other big greens about organizing this  protest, and were keen to work with local NYC groups.  So when NYC-EJA informed us that they would only  engage with the big greens if CJA got involved, we  started preparing a pitch to the CJA Leadership Body  (representatives of all CJA members groups) as well  as the CJA Steering Committee. We also initiated a  preliminary call to discuss possibilities with 350.  org, the Sierra Club and Avaaz.”8 The larger organizations—  especially 350.org and the Sierra Club—  understood the need to have local NYC base-building  organizations involved to establish credibility across  the five boroughs. They also had been interested in  collaborating with CJA since the merger of the 1 Sky  Coalition and 350.org. So, after an initial convening  of local environmental justice groups, anti-fracking  groups, organized labor and these big greens in NYC  in February 2014, the idea for the People’s Climate  March was born.  Initially, there was considerable debate among CJA  Steering Committee members on whether to take on  this monumental task. At the center of this debate  was a historical distrust that many grassroots  groups had with several national environmental organizations.  Specifically, some CJA members had  direct experiences of being tokenized, betrayed  and their work being appropriated by some of  these big greens. There were also differences in  strategy, many feeling that the national climate  policy agenda controlled by the big greens at times  has been fundamentally opposed to the core values  of grassroots environmentalism—self-determination,  democratic process, and solidarity.9 Too  often shaped by funder agendas and not popular  mandate, the big greens’ policy platforms have  focused on market-based solutions agreeable to  industry; promoting alternatives to fossil fuels  that are not truly renewable; and capital-intensive  pollution control technologies. For environmental  justice and grassroots groups, such climate advocacy  strategies not only exacerbated the carbon pollution  burdens, but also served to increase toxic pollutants  in the backyards of poor communities, entrenched  the market hegemony of the biggest polluting  corporations, and avoided naming (and thus failing)  to address the roots causes of the climate crises.  Grassroots and frontline community groups are not  only concerned about the storms, droughts and other  weather events that characterize climate change in  the mainstream narrative, but are concerned about  ORGANIZING  THE PEOPLE’S  CLIMATE MARCH  7 According to Ananda Lee Tan, one of the organizers of the PCM, “During  the Common Ground collaborative meeting Tom Goldtooth of the IEN  suggested that members of CJA, Indigenous communities, environmental  justice groups and big greens collaborate on organizing an event around  the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples conference in September  2014. This meeting was hosted by Wes Gillingham of Catskills Mountainkeeper,  and included representatives from CJA, IEN, GAIA, 350.org, Sierra  Club and others.”  8 Email from Ananda Lee Tan to I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  9 See the Principles of Environmental Justice, written by the First National  People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991 (.  )  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY what some have called the dig, burn, dump economy  and its life cycle impacts. This means that naming  problems and framing solutions from the point of  extraction through dirty production, transportation  and waste disposal are critical to addressing climate  change.  After much debate, CJA committed itself to the  project; its investment evolved and grew exponentially  over time largely because of the leadership  from local organizations in New York and New  Jersey. It became clear that the PCM presented an  opportunity for frontline Indigenous communities,  communities of color and working class folks to  1) provide leadership in an expanding movement  on climate change through the coordination of the  PCM; 2) have a say in the direction of the PCM;  3) create space—in the Tribunal, the People’s  Climate Justice Summit and actions—to make clear  demands, especially given the lack of demands in  the PCM; and 4) create a platform to be heard, to  build strategically with allies to expand and advance  this growing movement. The commitment to the  Jemez Principles10 as a guiding framework for the  Mobilization Support Team process helped boost  the confidence of CJA members and allied environmental  justice groups, especially when it became  clear that these principles served to make the  Mobilization Support Team decision-making process  more transparent, democratic and accountable to  the community-based leadership of NYC. According  to Ananda Lee Tan:  When 350.org staff first asked for introductions  to local EJ groups in NYC (back in 2013),  we suggested that they exercise a measure of  respect in their dealings with our local partners,  especially in recognizing the historic leadership  of NYC-EJA members on local climate and environmental  justice issues. In the fall of 2013,  when early discussions of organizing a march  in NYC took place, we advised the national  groups that in order to establish credibility in  NYC, we needed to partner with NYC-EJA and  other local EJ groups first...as these groups  had the strongest relationships with both  community and political leadership (including  the Mayor’s office and cops) on such issues.  Later in the spring of 2014, when it became  clear that the national groups would have  trouble understanding the importance of EJ  principles, and were starting to fumble and  step on numerous local toes, we suggested  that the Mobilization Support Team adopt the  Jemez Principles of Democratic Organizing  as the basis (operating principles) for our  collaboration. While all the Mobilization  Support Team partners agreed to do so, we  acknowledged that [some] groups would not  be able to internalize the Jemez Principles  in their own operational structures. We also  suggested that the local New York-New Jersey  PCM Host Committee also adopt Jemez as part  of their operational agreements, and provided  some 101 advice on how to do so.  THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF  ORGANIZING THE PCM  The planning and coordination of the PCM required  an investment of a substantial amount of time, energy  and resources in a very short span of time. Initially  the organizing process was largely decentralized.  The Mobilization Support Team was created to make  key political, financial and logistical decisions. A New  York/New Jersey Host Committee anchored the local  and regional outreach efforts. Other committees and  online “hubs”11 were formed to address a variety of  needs, including logistical, communications, arts,  local organizing, fundraising and outreach, and more.  10 The Jemez Principles emerged from the Environmental Justice Principles,  and were developed in the early years of the “global justice” movement,  as a set of protocols to help large national NGOs understand, respect and  abide by the cultures of practice agreed to amongst grassroots, community  groups leading this movement. Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing  were developed to forge common understanding and guide collaborative  processes and relationships between people from different cultures, politics  and organizations. They were created and adopted in 1996 by a multi-racial  group of activists for the Working Group Meeting on Globalization and  Trade ().  11 The hub sites allowed people planning to participate in the PCM to  coordinate self-organized projects and actions with whomever they  wanted around any set of parameters, such as those coming from the same  geographic location, the same skills set, a common identity or an issue  people cared about most. The online system provided tools for people to  communicate and build together.  10 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  A national monthly conference call was convened to  share information with activists and organizations  throughout the country.  To coordinate such a broad-based effort, PCM  organizers had to overcome several key differences  in politics, ideas and culturally-rooted organizing  practices. It challenged people to face and deal with  assumptions, privilege, power and stereotypes. It  also forced members of the Mobilization Support  Team to shift their orientations so that differences  in organizing, communication, decision-making and  leadership became strengths rather than obstacles.  For instance, the culture of some organizations  is to act with quickness, agility and at significant  scale. Others are more deliberate in building base  and relationships in the community based on core  organizing principles. Both approaches were put  to the test and effectively utilized during the PCM  process. Over a 7-month period, national environmental  organizations, grassroots economic and environmental  groups, labor unions and online activist  organizations engaged in an inspiring process of  shared leadership, principles and mobilizing—  resulting in one of the most significant political  actions in recent times. And for the first time in US  climate advocacy history, grassroots environmental  justice organizations became equal partners at the  table with national green groups and labor, working  in coordination, cross-racially and cross-sectorally  to organize this massive mobilization.In the course of organizing the PCM, there were  several important pieces that illustrate key areas of  agreement, struggle and work. They are captured in  the following sections.  12 Sally Kohn, After Years of Racial Division, the Green Movement Gets Brown  (/14)  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY FLIPPING THE SCRIPT FOR  A NEW MOVEMENT NARRATIVE  The composition and formation of the march was a  critical and difficult early negotiation, and arguably  one of the biggest gains for frontline, environmental  justice (EJ) communities.13 The significance of the  front of the march was substantial: it is the place  where local and national media focus their attention  for interviews, reporting, image frames and media  bytes. In the US climate movement, the front of  most climate marches has typically been a place  dominated by white college students and members of  Sierra Club Chapters. After the “Forward on Climate”  protest, some AFL-CIO leaders said they could not  take the US climate movement seriously as long as  they were defined by their lily white, Ivy League  image.14 Meanwhile, for the US environmental justice  movement, place-based, bottom-up leadership  is critical to maintaining respectful relationships  across the movement. In the end, Indigenous and  other environmental justice communities led the  march both literally and metaphorically, placing  faces and voices of communities most vulnerable to  and at the “frontlines” of the climate crisis front and  center. At stake in this decision was how well the  PCM would reflect the growing climate movement  in the United States in a way that demonstrated the  issues, faces and voices of those impacted first and  worst by climate change.  Despite an initial agreement by the NY-NJ Host  Committee in favor of UPROSE’s recommendation  that frontline communities be at the front of the  PCM (with youth of color forming the very first  line at the front), subsequent alternate frontline  proposals kept getting recommended; hence the  struggle. To be clear, that there was struggle didn’t  mean that national allies failed to see or appreciate  the value of the frontlines. Rather it simply meant  that people needed to move through the natural  process of debate to ultimately arrive at the best  outcomes. In the end, an agreement was reached by  which indigenous peoples and other people of color  from frontline communities would lead the march  under the banner Frontlines of the Crisis, Forefront  of Change. The youth delegation—specifically young  people of color and Indigenous youth under the  age of 24—were at the very front and the rest of  the frontlines contingent marched in the following  order: representatives of local communities  impacted by Hurricane Sandy, Indigenous Peoples’  Block, member groups of CJA and other environmental  justice communities from across the U.S.,  other storm-impacted communities, anti-poverty  groups, representatives of global south movements,  domestic workers, farm workers, immigrant rights  groups and the migrant justice contingent.  The other formations were carefully and intentionally  negotiated as well. CJA members suggested that  its brothers and sisters from labor unions march  behind the frontline community formation, carrying  the banner We Can Build the Future to denote the  important leadership role that workers have to  assume in building the new, low-carbon economy.  Members of the Mobilization Support Team agreed  that youth groups, students and families would  march with this contingent to illustrate the inter-  generational leadership of the movement as well  as to highlight the generations who will be building  the new systems to replace the old.  After labor, youth and families, the Movement  Support Team agreed that the solutions’ practitioners  should march along with green groups who advocate  for, create and practice economic alternatives in  community energy, zero waste, public transportation,  local food and ecosystem restoration – together  carrying a banner that read We Have the Solutions.  After the solutions formation, all the campaigning  organizations and issue-focused groups organizing  to stop polluting industries and their financiers were  invited to march under the banner We Know Who’s  Responsible. This acknowledged that the climate  13 Environmental justice communities are generally low income and/or  people of color communities directly impacted by one or more environmental  hazards; their residents tend to be excluded from processes and  discussions on environmental regulations and policies that directly impact  them; and they are subject to inequitable implementation of environmental  regulations, requirements, practices and activities in their communities.  14 According to Ananda Lee Tan, this comment was made at a meeting of  labor, environmental and other progressive movements that labor activist  Joe Uehlein of the Labor Network for Sustainability pulled together at the  same time as the Forward on Climate protest in DC. As a result, participants  signed a statement that can be found at this link: .  org/uncategorized/labor-environmental-leaders-move-beyond-differences-  to-a-common-vision/.  12 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  movement must continue fighting the corporations  driving the present economic system causing the  ecological crises—from dirty energy companies to  the oil, gas and mining sector, big agri-businesses,  waste corporations, Walmart and the banks…the list  was long. After this formation, the science and faith  communities followed with a banner that read The  Debate is Over—messaging that the age of “climate  denialism” is finally over, and that science and the  moral high ground are cardinal points for US leaders  to take action. Finally, all other march participants  were invited to join behind the banner that read To  Change Everything, We Need Everyone!  FUNDRAISING AND  RESOURCE SHARING  Groups involved in the planning of the PCM began  fundraising early on. Some national environmental  organizations like 350.org, Sierra Club and  Avaaz made initial pledges to the PCM from their  budgets amounting to over $1.5 million. This first  set of resources was placed into an entity called Res  Publica, a civic organization co-founded by Avaaz  and that has acted as a fiscal sponsor for many organizations.  While Res Publica managed core project  expenses and donations for the PCM, PCM organizers  initially agreed that each group would raise funds  for their own organizing efforts to prevent fighting  over resources.  According to GGJ National Coordinator Cindy  Wiesner, “even for the big greens, it became hard to get  resources, having to go into their general operating  funds to put money towards the mobilization.”15 Yet  these organizations had dedicated development staff  to make appeals to donors, and it eventually became  clear that many funders preferred giving money to  larger national groups rather than contributing to a  shared fund or donating to grassroots organizations  directly.16 This reinforced a power dynamic whereby  the larger national organizations were in charge of  money, leaving many local groups to constantly have  to ask for help. Finally, fundraising and resource  sharing took place unevenly and of the funding-related  challenges that arose, many resulted from  ineffective or absent systems and protocols for  collecting and sharing resources. While mistakes  were made, it is clear that organizing at this scale  and pace and within such a short planning window  made it difficult to avoid them.  CJA initially set conservative fundraising goals as  part of the National Coordination Team.17 As this  body was sharpening a proposal for $75,000 to  an allied funder, its members learned that several  national environmental organizations were planning  to approach a set of New York City funders with a  proposal for nearly $7 million. On learning about  the big green proposal, CJA organizers decided on  two major shifts to its fundraising strategy:  • Break out of the cultures of scarcity that grassroots  and EJ groups often get mired in, and ask for a  much bolder amount to reflect CJA’s long term  aspirations of building a durable, grassroots  movement rooted in communities of practice, and  • Intervene with CJA’s big green partners to a) point  out that such large sums of funding should be  prioritized for long-term organizing in frontline  communities, not simply one day media events,  and b) ensure that approaching funders was done  together, with all proposal language vetted by CJA.  The relationships CJA had cultivated with the Sierra  Club through the Building Equity and Alignment for  Impact Initiative process initiated by the Overbrook  15 Email to I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  16 In fact, local organizations like UPROSE struggled with fundraising. Even  when the larger organizations brought them to meetings and urged them  to fund these grassroots groups directly, the funders responded with a  “thanks, but no thanks,” and instead granted resources to the larger organizations.  17 Staying consistent with EJ principles, CJA determined that it would  follow the leadership of the NY members and in so doing, would provide  national support. This led to the formation of a National Coordination Team  that included local leadership from New Jersey, New York and national  alliances (e.g., Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, Indigenous  Environmental Network, Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, etc.). While  NYC-EJA would lead on local organizing and coordination, the National  Coordination Team would help with national coordination, which included  fundraising, negotiating with funders, coordinating CJA and allied grassroots  involvement, and sitting at the national table with the national environmental  organizations to help ensure the messaging out to other national organizations  was consistent with CJA messaging, framing, Jemez approach, etc.  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY Foundation allowed them to leverage agreement  with the rest of the Mobilization Support Team  on these interventions. As the planning process  moved forward, and relationships within this team  grew stronger, a number of resources were made  available to CJA members and affiliates. Firstly,  Sierra Club and 350.org agreed to make transportation  subsidies available to provide buses, vans and  trains for EJ and grassroots groups to travel to NYC.  This amounted to over $180,000 and included the  expenses of 55 charter buses, which CJA members  filled. Additionally, 350.org, Greenpeace and some  other groups contributed towards some of the cost  of bringing on board local NYC organizers to work  with NYC-EJA.  On their own, CJA and its member groups stretched  themselves to bring in resources, presenting on  webinars that reached 89 funders . In total, they  raised over $300,000, of which over half was passed  through to local NYC and NJ partners. The initial  grant to CJA from the Chorus Foundation went to  the NYC-EJA, UPROSE and Ironbound Community  Corporation. Additional resources went to  Indigenous Environmental Network for supporting  and coordinating Indigenous Peoples’ delegations,  Right to the City for logistics and member outreach,  GAIA for supporting the overall coordination as well  East Coast member mobilization and to the Ruckus  Society for its direct action training. However, much  of the work leading up that point was done through  in-kind contributions. By the time resources began  to come in, grassroots groups were struggling  financially and wound up paying more for expenses  like flights and hotels because discounts were no  longer available. Other groups covered the travel  and lodging costs of large delegations of members  and international allies to New York out of their own  budgets, such as Grassroots Global Justice Alliance.  Lots of other types of resources were donated and  shared, including staff and volunteers, building rents  and usage, art supplies, fundraising events, meals,  fliers, media trainings and more. Strengthening the  practice around resource sharing and increasing  transparency in the allocation and decision making  power related to it are lessons towards a stronger  movement-building practice.  14 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  MESSAGING AND MEDIA  Communications was one of the most important  areas of collaboration in the PCM. Developing an  overall message for the march was challenging since  there were a number of issues that divided organizations:  Keystone XL, fracking, cap and trade. The  Mobilization Support Team made the strategic  decision to “caste the appropriate-sized net” by  agreeing on a broad set of core messages while  creating space for everyone to articulate their own  perspectives and political positions. The march  would “reset” the movement by providing a space  for working relationships to develop in the midst of  some deep political differences.  Determining the messengers for the event was  just as important as the message. The NY-NJ Host  Committee committed early to the principle of a  “People’s” Climate March, which meant that the  official spokespeople would not be celebrities or  traditional political leaders; rather it was agreed  that grassroots frontline leaders would be front  and center and given the support they needed for  their messages to reach a broad audience. One of  the key slogans, It Takes Roots to Weather the Storm,  was created at Center for Story-Based Strategy’s  workshop in Boston for a small cohort of CJA  members. This slogan means that the “communities  best prepared to survive today’s ecological crises are  those that have the strongest, deepest and longest  connections with the earth.” Traditional Indigenous  knowledge worldwide is critical for all people to  withstand the floods, droughts and storms resulting  from climate change. Participants in the training  agreed that “we needed to communicate to both the  UN and the US public that in order to meet the scale  and intensity of the climate crisis, world leaders  and nation states need to follow the leadership of  place-based communities and cultures of practice.  Traditional Indigenous knowledge coupled with  local, democratic resource governance is the most  reliable path for planetary survival.”CJA’s social media capacity grew steadily in 2014 as  member organizations organized Twitter storms and  Facebook campaigns for the Our Power Gatherings.  Due to collaborations with 350.org and The Other  98%, CJA’s social media reach grew exponentially  via the PCM—ultimately peaking at 1.5 million.  Our total Facebook reach on September 21 was  1,566,366. And the combined social media reachin relation to the PCM was over 8.8 million through  Facebook and 3.3 Twitter messages per second (on  the day of the PCM).  ARTS SPACES IN THE COMMUNITY  vs. OF THE COMMUNITY  The Arts Space was where the visually stunning  and memorable art captured in the media was  created for the People’s Climate March. Artists of  all kinds—from trained professionals to committed  volunteers—painted, drew, constructed and  assembled a variety of banners, parachutes, signs  carrying meaningful slogans, puppets and more.  One of the more popular symbols, the sunflowers,  were painted between UPROSE’s office and the Arts  Space. The sunflower was first used by local Detroit  environmental justice organizers as a symbol of  community resilience in the march to shut down  the Detroit incinerator during the 2010 U.S. Social  Forum. Since then, it has been used for the same  purpose and to demonstrate continuity of struggle  among CJA members. Its use in the march was led by  UPROSE. Shared Elizabeth Yeampierre, “We…chose  the sunflowers as an expression of solidarity with  Richmond and Detroit. We also wanted to show that  we weren’t alone; that we were part of something  bigger, stronger, united, inter-generational, and  based in communities of color.”“communities best prepared to survive  today’s ecological crises are those that  have the strongest, deepest and longest  connections with the earth.”  18 Interview with Ananda Lee Tan  19 Reach is the number of unique individuals who received timeline deliveries  of hashtagged messages. Similar to Timeline deliveries, there is no way to  know how many of the messages were viewed. Because the same users may  receive multiple timeline deliveries, measuring reach as well as deliveries  allows you to better understand the true spread of your message.  20 In interview with I. Kilimanjaro (/14)  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY An army of local and regional artists and dedicated  volunteers worked round the clock to create  stunning images of giant puppets, banners, placards,  parachutes and other creative props that defined  the character, beauty and creative spirit of the  PCM. The Indigenous bloc banners were used to  amplify messages on the Rights of Mother Earth and  opposition to tar sands and controversial cap and  trade policies. Many of CJA’s visuals were captured by  media outlets. While the Arts Space inspired the most  memorable elements of the march, upon reflection,  it also represented some of the most difficult contradictions.  It was established in a warehouse building  that was not easy to get to and was located in a  rapidly gentrifying Latin@ neighborhood. Artists  and volunteers struggled with limited capacity and  lead time, few financial resources, and a hectic and  sometimes chaotic environment. Some artists were  paid by organizations for their services while most  were volunteers. This created tensions in trying  to create a collective, collaborative space. The fact  that many of the artists and volunteers were white  added to the tensions. Although the volunteers and  organizers were able to get through the challenges  that this presented, future efforts will most certainly  need to take into consideration the dynamics that  are created when issues of race, class and gender are  not systematically addressed.  PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH  ORGANIZING PROCESS:  SOME KEY SUCCESS  Grassroots leadership from the frontlines: The  organizing principles and approach, as already noted,  succeeding in putting the leadership of frontline  communities at the center. This included authentic  grassroots leaders like Mari Rose Turac from  Richmond, CA (with the Asian Pacific Environment  Network), Kandi Mossett form North Dakota (with  Indigenous Environmental Network) and Stanley  Strugill from Appalachia (with Kentuckians for  the Commonwealth). It also included the NY/NJ  leadership, which, in spite of the many challenges,  worked hard, held people accountable, helped to  shape the messaging, got the word out, organized  people throughout the region to attend the march,  and did so much more. The real and perceived  leadership and participation in the movement  helped to broaden the base going forward, as people  were able to clearly see they have a place in it.  Forging new relationships: Coming back from the  experience, there were many beautiful stories of the  relationships built among the participants, especially  the delegates that caravaned on buses, trains, planes,  bringing with them their excitement, confidence, and  hope for the future. For the organizers, a successful  outcome of the PCM organizing process was the relationships  forged between people representing  different sectors and between representatives of  groups that have not always gotten along. Discussed  in more detail elsewhere in this report, this is  especially noteworthy for the relationships between  grassroots environmental justice groups and their  networks (including CJA) and national environmental  groups like 350.org, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace,  and Avaaz in light of historic tensions between environmental  justice groups and big greens. This was by  no means a perfect process and work is still needed;  but significant gains were made in this area.  Forcing political leaders to pay attention: The scale  of the march—and the presence of a diversity of  communities and sectors that went far beyond the  “usual suspects” of climate politics —sent a message  to the political leadership preparing to meet at the  United Nations that they need to be accountable to  the grassroots. This was most obvious when Ban  Ki-Moon, Al Gore and NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio finally  joined the March.  NYC-based grassroots leadership, leveraging PCM  to advance NYC-based campaigns: The local NY/  NJ leadership collaborations with national groups  leveraged the PCM to make progress with NYC-based  climate and environmental justice demands. Two  strategically timed banner drops by UPROSE and  NYC-EJA during the March highlighted the need  for waste equity and Zero Waste, a long-standing  local environmental justice campaign, as well as  the harmful impacts of gentrification in Brooklyn  and its intersection with climate change. Since then,  New York City’s Mayor announced the city’s new  16 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  sustainability plan called OneNYC and one of the  centerpieces, according to Eddie Bautista, “…is a  Zero Waste commitment with a stated goal of 90%  diversion of waste from landfills and a commitment  to overhaul the City’s commercial waste system.”  On the gentrification fight, Elizabeth Yeampierre of  UPROSE shared, “We had been reading articles and  hearing that a new property owner on our waterfront  was meeting with organizations and elected officials  to push for land uses that were inconsistent with our  community’s vision and needs. The company has  deep pockets and we felt we needed assistance to  amplify our concerns...The support that we received  from Greenpeace and Ruckus gave us visibility at an  unheard of scale—a scale that was equivalent to the  size of our struggle. The banners were seen by over  400,000 people which included our elected officials.  Days after, UPROSE was called to a meeting with two  congressional representatives and was able to gain  the support of important unions that marched with  us and begin the creation of a powerful coalition to  fight back against massive displacement.”PCM ORGANIZING PROCESS:  KEY POINTS OF CHALLENGE AND  CONFLICT  Although the challenges and points of conflict  are outnumbered by the successes and points of  alignment, many lessons are already informing  ongoing efforts.  Capacity, Internal Tensions and Priorities Given  that the People’s Climate Week was not originally in  CJA’s own plans and two “Our Power” Gatherings for  CJA members and allies were already in the works  (Detroit and Richmond), the Alliance set modest  goals at first—a small delegation of about 100  people. As it became clear that additional capacity  was required, CJA and its two co-anchors, Grassroots  Global Justice and Movement Generation, created a  division of labor that significantly stretched their  collective capacity.  One point of tension was around CJA’s priorities.  CJA National Coordinator Michael Leon Guerrero  raised the concern, “…how was CJA going to meet  its priority to build up and support the Our Power  communities when so much capacity and resources  were being directed toward the PCM and related  mobilizations? CJA was taking a huge risk; if we  didn’t have the numbers—if the PCM didn’t turn out  at least 100,000 people—it could have set us back as  an alliance and movement. Because of the level of  investment, it would’ve been a hard conversation to  have with members.”On the other side, national environmental organizations  and the PCM itself hired new organizers to  meet the urgent need to expand organizing capacity,  sometimes with insufficient training and oversight.  The result, according to organizer Samantha Corbin,  was that grassroots groups in the planning process  were being asked to provide input on decisions  without sufficient time to solicit input from their  bases:  Many people came in with good intentions and  tried to do it well; this was why it was possible  to work. But good intentions aren’t enough.  They are necessary but not sufficient. Some of  the depth was lost around time – not just that  it was a rapid pace, but some of the steps we  would take we weren’t able to take. Trying  to understand each other before jumping into  work never happened. All groups brought  something legit and real, but I saw lack of understanding  and appreciation.  Samantha’s assessment speaks to several important  elements that must be put into place to minimize  mistakes, burn-out, hurt feelings and more in any  comparable future collaborative planning process:  relationship and trust-building; effective systems  of communication and accountability; and principle-  guided work process and decisions. All of  these get quickly lost and/or overlooked in the  acceleration of a planning process if they are not  built in early on.21 Email from Elizabeth Yeampierre to I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  22 Interview with I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  23 Interview with I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY CJA and its grassroots member groups and allies  were confronted with how to engage members in a  meaningful way so that vision and principles of the  CJA and PCM were understood and shared rather  than members simply showing up and going home.  Yet the pace of the overall PCM organizing was not  especially conducive to this. Monica Wilson of the  Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA)  shared that “…it was challenging to bring the whole  network along with us. We didn’t want to show up  as GAIA’s staff, but as the network and as CJA. And  so bringing members of our network along was  challenging, while having to move that fast. But we  tried hard and that’s how we all build a stronger  movement…” Yet people working across CJA in  endless meetings at UPROSE’s offices experienced  some powerful moments when the realization hit  that they could get so much done together. According  to Ananda Lee Tan, “When we got up to scale, there  was trust and collaborative practice. Bottom up  organizing can achieve better pace if adequately  resourced.”  Communications A challenge that several CJA  organizers articulated was the absence of an  efficient communication system among themselves  and with PCM staff and volunteers. Difficulties and  occasionally tensions grew as the pace quickened.  For example, while several of the environmental  organizations shared office space in the Manhattan  office, there was little coordination with Mobilization  Support Team leaders and march organizers  who were not in that space, particularly around  messaging and outreach. This meant that often  decisions were made but did not get passed along  to the people responsible for carrying them out,  which often led to conflicts, issues of accountability,  people doing things that were not in alignment  with the team, or making mistakes. On the day of the  March, many decisions were made on the fly and not  communicated, which led to a tremendous amount  of confusion for the volunteers and staff.  That the communications in the organizing process  were not effective doesn’t negate the incredible  efforts of key organizers to share information as  best as they could under the circumstances. Key to  point out here is that when systems, processes and  point people are not established and identified early,  breakdowns and confusion are more likely as the  pace naturally picks up and the event nears.  Race and Privilege Issues related to race and  privilege emerged in a few instances during the  18 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  organizing process. In the rush to do things, some  members of the team often did not take the time to  engage local leadership, frontline communities and  communities of color in the development of talking  points, posters and other communications materials.  This led, for example, to English-only advertisements  on the subway system and Chinese-language posters  with the wrong date of the PCM.  To the credit of many members of the Mobilization  Support Team, assumptions and missteps were  named, struggled over and addressed as best  as possible, resulting in greater accountability  in subsequent behaviors and decision-making  processes. One 350.org organizer, for example,  solicited input that helped produce more robust,  meaningful and appropriate talking points.  As referenced above, the dynamic between  newly-hired white college-age organizers working  in communities of color and organizers based  in those communities also created challenges  early on. But this changed, however, in the weeks  leading up to the march as the larger organizations  recognized the local leadership already organizing  in communities and learned that partnering with  these organizations and supporting local infrastructure  is a more effective approach to organizing in  those communities.  Organizing Culture Another challenge that emerged  was related to the different orientation that environmental  organizations and environmental justice  groups have around relationships. The larger organizations  tend to be more transactional in how they  relate to organizations they don’t know or haven’t  worked with—especially environmental justice  groups. On the other hand, the environmental justice  groups in CJA tend to be more transformational,  focusing on a deeper level of relationship-building  that leads to longer term change. This orientation—  which is rooted in different constituencies and  definitions of membership—leads to differences in  organizing strategies. The national environmental  organizations tend to have members that are  mostly middle class, white and/or affluent, whereas  CJA members and the communities in which they  organize are poor and working class Indigenous,  people of color and white communities. Neither  organizing approach is fundamentally wrong, but  each brings about different aims, and coherence of  such differing strategies can be a major challenge.  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY Members of the Climate Justice Alliance and allies helped to organize the  People’s Tribunal and Climate Justice Summit. These two critical compliments  to the PCM created space for activists, scholars and frontline communities from  around the world to delve more deeply into the drivers and impacts of climate  change, providing examples from their own communities while creating,  sharing and strategizing with one another on some important components of  building a winning climate movement. CJA partnered with the New School to  host the People’s Climate Justice Summit and the United Methodist Women to  host the People’s Tribunal at the United Nations Church Center.  PEOPLE’S CLIMATE JUSTICE SUMMIT  The People’s Climate Justice Summit (PCJS) provided space for the sharing  of experiences, struggles, and solutions between five local, 13 national and  10 international representatives of communities either directly impacted by  climate change or directly fighting the extreme energy economy and extractive  industries and market regimes that drive climate change. The PCJS hosted  panels featuring the stories, proposals, and demands of communities first and  most impacted.  During this two day summit, panelists addressed a host of false promises  and quick fixes that perpetuate inequalities, ecological destruction and  extreme energy development, including dams, waste-to-energy schemes,  carbon markets and climate smart agriculture. They also discussed systems  alternatives and strategies for a just transition in which their communities  were engaged. “In the opening panel of the [PCJS], speakers were in consensus  about rejecting the financialization of nature, but the question arose: might  we need to use pieces of this approach to keep corporations accountable or to  protect natural resources?”24 On the panel that followed, movement leaders  from Brazil to Mexico to New Jersey shared struggles against incinerators and  dams while articulating desires to transform the extractive economy via what  CJA calls just transition pathways. A third panel spoke to the threats of climate  smart agriculture to people and the planet and the importance of youth in  leading real solutions today.  24 Matt Feinstein, While UN Climate Summit Makes False Promises, People’s Climate Summit Brings Community-  Led Solutions (/14)  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE JUSTICE  SUMMIT AND TRIBUNAL  20 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  PEOPLE’S TRIBUNAL  On the same day as the UN Climate Summit, the  People’s Tribunal put on trial the corporations,  governments and the United Nations for doing  little to slow climate change and address issues of  adaptation, mitigation and historical responsibility  in real ways. On trial were the false promises they  continue to promote, which mask their inaction  and perpetuate the problems through destructive  market mechanisms. The People’s Judicial Panel—  whose role was to listen to and amplify the voices of  those who are witness to and impacted by climate  and environmental injustices—included movement  activists Lisa Garcia of Earth Justice, Julia Olson  of Our Children’s Trust, Rex Varona of the Global  Coalition on Migration, and Jeremy Brecher of the  Labor Network on Sustainability. The Judicial Panel  concluded that “based on the evidence we have  heard here today, the nations of our world are in  violation of their most fundamental legal and constitutional  obligations.”  Testimonies were offered by members of frontline  communities from 14 years of age and up and moved  from struggles in the New York / New Jersey region  through the United States to Mali, Honduras, Kenya,  Ecuador and Peru, to name a few. The issues about  which people testified were varied and included  the destruction of food systems, criminalization  of resistance, contamination of water and air, the  collusion of governments with corporations and  drug lords to steal land and rule by violence, the  poisoning of land through extractive chemicals and  technologies, and the imposition of trade agreements  that undermine local economies. The Judges  following the final panel shared this: “The good news  is that people are inspired and are still willing—after  all of this devastation—to come together to take  action...We were completely inspired to continue to  take action and not let the decisions of those across  the street change our minds.”  CONTRIBUTION OF  INTERNATIONAL ALLIES  With support from CJA, the Grassroots Global Justice  Alliance and Grassroots International co-chaired the  International Committee. Together they brought  a strong cohort of over 40 social movement representatives  from the Global South to the march and  tribunal with two purposes: accompany and show  solidarity to the communities and organizations  represented in CJA and represent the struggles and  perspectives of Global South communities. These  international allies made important contributions  to the panels at the PCJS and testimonies at the  Tribunal, demonstrating that we not only share  common enemies, but also share similar visions for  a just future. Engaging in these kinds of building  and sharing opportunities broke the isolation and  helped to advance a common agenda for climate  justice, systems change and just transition between  our members and our global partners.  Some of the key leaders were: Rosa Guillen of World  March of Women from Peru, Mithika Mwenda of Pan  African Climate Justice Alliance from Kenya, Maxime  Combes and Christophe Aguiton of ATTAC France,  Juliette Rousseau of Alternatibas, Mary Ann Manahan  from Focus on the Global South, Jorge Santiago  from DESMI (Social and Economic Development for  Indigenous Mexicans) in Mexico, Miriam Miranda  from the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras,  Srijana Poudel from the Women Awareness Center  in Nepal, Elisa Estronioli from the Movement of  People Affected by Dams in Brazil, Mamadou Goïta  from the Institute for Research and the Promotion of  Alternatives in Development in Mali, and more.  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY FLOOD WALL STREET  The day after the PCM, direct action organizers—many from Occupy Wall  Street and the post-Hurricane Sandy movement assembly along with CJA  member organizations like Ruckus Society and Rising Tide North America—  organized the Flood Wall Street action at Battery Park. This was a response to  CJA’s Call to Action in solidarity with all communities on the frontlines of the  climate crises. This act of solidarity was significant in that Flood Wall Street’s  (FWS) mainly white organizers succeeded in respectfully aligning with and  engaging frontline communities in the planning of the action. CJA members  helped facilitate a number of the early action planning calls, facilitated dialogue  between local action organizers and environmental justice community groups,  and sent a large delegation of members and international allies to this action.  DIRECT ACTION  22 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  Over 2,000 people took over Wall Street to denounce  the role of multi-national corporations and financial  institutions in promoting fossil fuel exploitation and  other forms of destructive, extractive energy. FWS  organizers met their articulated goals of planning a  successful action more daring than the PCM both in  its form and its content, as they directly targeted the  economic roots of the climate crisis. FWS organizers  attempted to build relationships, solicit input and  attempt to make sure their frames were useful.  But “CJA folks weren’t available to respond or fully  engage in the action organizing process with them.  This was more a symptom of the over-stretched and  limited capacity, not from a lack of desire or from  political difference.”As in other direct action demonstrations, activists  (more often but not exclusively white) that are  willing and able to take actions involving a greater  level of risk are themselves often not grounded  in organizing practices that are relevant to  Indigenous, communities of color and working class  communities. In the course of planning this action,  the Ruckus Society provided guidance on what  consultation means and what actual collaboration  looks like. Some of the challenges in the planning  process required teaching people what it means to  do an action on behalf of the grassroots and helping  CJA folks understand why doing direct action was  also as critical.  Flood Wall Street coordinators organized a panel of  international allies and social movements before the  direct action to provide political education for those  who were to take part. The CJA delegates were well  prepared and participated with enthusiasm. Several  international delegates shared with Saulo Araujo  from Why Hunger that they were happy to see  people form the U.S. engaging in the struggle. “They  don’t see that too often in newspapers, because of  the filtering (blockade) by the corporate media. The  composition of different international voices was  another highlight. It seems the only voice from North  America was Naomi Klein.”ACTION AT THE UNITED NATIONS  On September 23, 2014, United Nations head Ban  Ki Moon convened a one-day UN Summit on climate  change to galvanize support from government  leaders for a new international agreement to curb  emissions and implement strategies for climate  change adaptation. Members of CJA, allies and  supporters attempted to bring a statement that  afternoon from the people to world leaders in  attendance at the Summit, but were refused entry to  the United Nations. The statement wrote:  We demand that world leader’s support and  move money to our community-led priorities  and local infrastructure needs to build  sustainable community economies, energy  democracy, zero waste, food justice, public  transit and affordable housing – pathways  that can create millions of long-term jobs and  put our communities back to work. We support  Indigenous peoples, our brothers and sisters of  the North and the Global South, in their climate  justice struggles linking land and water rights,  land title and the full implementation of the  UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous  Peoples.  Kandi Mossett of the Indigenous Environmental  Network risked her credentials to deliver the  full statement inside the UN Climate Summit. The  exclusion of community members on the frontlines  of the crisis reaffirmed what many already knew:  that today’s decision-making arenas have been  taken over by a corporate agenda that prioritizes  destructive profit-driven policies over the well-being  of families, workers and communities. Although  people were turned back, the action was important  for the message it sent to the world about a growing  movement of people on the frontlines of the climate  crisis.  25 Interview with I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  26 Email to I. Kilimanjaro (/15)  THE PEOPLE’S CLIMATE MARCH 2014: A CLIMATE JUSTICE STORY KEY LESSONS  FROM NYC  CLIMATE WEEK  Numerous lessons have emerged since the  September 2014 mobilizations and events, some of  which are presented below.  Lead with transformative vision and practice: NYC  Climate Week inspired many to share, evolve and/  or articulate transformative visions, often based on  principles and meta-narratives like just transition.  This concept is rooted in historic conflicts between  communities and workers on the frontlines of environmental  justice struggles and is about negotiating  pathways to local economies that are environmentally  sustainable and healthy. Spelling out these  transition pathways to new economies provides  vision, hope, and clear and actionable steps for  people and communities to take. For CJA’s Our Power  campaign, this involves implementing zero-waste  solutions, community housing initiatives, local food  systems and much more. Building such systems will  allow communities to be better prepared to weather  the storms that climate change is wreaking on  populations around the world.  Ensuring organizing at a fast pace doesn’t sacrifice  deeper-level questions. When things are moving fast  in an organizing process or mobilization, depth is  often lost as there is little time to spend discussing  and working through deeper-level questions. Early  in an organizing process, we need to ensure that  systems, guided by principles and clear protocols,  are put into place as best as possible. This means  anticipating volunteer and staffing needs and  developing/identifying training materials. It entails  building in time for training informed by an intersectional  analysis of race, class, gender, patriarchy,  and heteronormativity that also articulates local  conditions, dynamics and needs. We need processes  that clarifies responsibilities, chain-of command,  decision-making processes, and internal communication  flow. We also need time early on to struggle  24 IT TAKES ROOTS TO WEATHER THE STORM  through ideas and develop key messages and talking  points.  Invest in the capacity of frontline organizations and  their alliances to meaningfully and fully contribute  to and participate in national agenda formation,  events and other movement building activities.  Greater transparency is needed in resource-sharing,  allocation, and decision-making related to it. If  equal resource allocation went to grassroots organizations,  it would create new and better conditions  for impactful organizational and cross-sectoral collaborations.  The other side of this is that frontline  communities need to be honest and realistic about  their own money and capacity to strategically  participate in various movement processes, mobilizations  and events.  It is clear that integrity in this area is fundamental  to any social movement’s progress. In the sacred  process of building a movement for systems change,  clarity on the what is needed to do that—in terms  of finances, human capacity and in other ways—is  critical, as is the establishment of clear guidelines  how to use, distribute and deploy resources.  Its also necessary to navigate the tension between  available resources, the urgency of the moment, and  the potential impact of the action. Although CJA’s  resources and capacity were low and stretched thin,  there was a real need to organize activities other  than the PCM where frontline community members  could speak directly to needs, concerns, challenges,  solutions and calls to action. For example, Ruckus  Society and several CJA members and allies, in spite  of overall exhaustion once the People’s Climate  March was over, succeeded in coordinating the  strategic action at the UN in one day.  Take risks to build relationships and trust: The PCM  demonstrated how social movements today must  take bold yet thoughtful risks to build powerful relationships  and achieve desired results. Though  the process of building trust was imperfect, trust  and faith in one another grew with small successes.  “Everyone took political risks entering the process  and making decisions. This meant that march  organizers had to put their organizational and  personal positions on the back burner so that a  broad level of political alignment on strategies could  be reached.”27 Getting to this point, however, requires  investment in building trust. Said Samantha Corbin:  People were trying to build relationships with  each other in good faith, but at the same time  the speed and urgency of the organizing kept  increasing. Everyone (and every group) had  needs that weren’t being met which at times  led to everyone feeling preyed upon by the  other. At some point, members of every group  expressed feeling used or taken advantage of  or not being listened to…And I saw it as a real  stumbling block between the [grassroots and  national organizations].  Related to building trust and relationships is naming  and committing to address issues of race and privilege  in honest and respectful ways. In some circumstances,  this involves anti-racist and anti-oppression work  in order to avoid fragmentation or the reproduction  of the the same inequities inside the movement that  prevail in the broader society. Supporting leadership  of local, frontline communities isn’t simply a race  issue. But the central importance of consulting with,  building with, and supporting the local leadership of  communities of color manifests most clearly when  predominantly white organizations and activists  are attempting to work in communities of color. As  a demonstration of this principle, the CJA national  leadership itself didn’t consider stepping up into a  leadership role in the planning of the PCM without  the invitation from and ongoing consultation and  coordination with NY-NJ members and allies. And  once they stepped into this role, they prioritized  funding and supporting their local members and  allies.  Take risks to build power: To build power, strategic  risk-taking is needed. A challenge that impacted the  planning of the Flood Wall Street action was the fear  many people have about arrests with mass direct  action. Building training and thoughtful discussion  of tactics into an organizing process can address  these fears, equipping people with the tools and  information necessary to make smart choices about  when and how to step into powerful actions that  involved heightened personal risk.  Recalibrate the Movement: Those hit first and  hardest by the environmental and climate crises  should have their voices and concerns heard most,  and their strategic and tactical leadership should  be respected. “By prioritizing representatives of  frontline communities...we are starting to shift the  national climate discourse around where climate  solutions should come from.”  "
GP-2014-1.txt,"greenpeace.org  Clicking Clean:  How Companies  are Creating the  Green Internet  April201  Executive  Summary  For the estimated 2.5 billion people around the  world who are connected to the internet, it is  impossible to imagine life without it. The internet  has rewoven the fabric of our daily lives – how  we communicate with each other, work and  entertain ourselves – and become a foundation  of the global economy.  Seemingly on a daily basis, new businesses that use  the internet as their foundation are disrupting and often  replacing long-standing business models and industries.  From music and video to communications and mail, more  and more of our “offline” world is moving online. We can  expect that trend to continue and accelerate as the global  online population reaches 50% of the world’s projected  population, moving from 2.3 billion in 2012 to an expected  3.6 billion people by 2017.While the online world appears to grow at the expense  of some traditional business models in the offline world,  it is rapidly creating increased demand for at least one  offline product: electricity. The rapid growth of the cloud  and our use of the internet have produced a collective  electricity demand that would currently rank in the top six  if compared alongside countries; that electricity demand  is expected to increase by 60% or more by 2020 as the  online population and our reliance on the internet steadily  increase.While shifting businesses to an online model can create  significant gains in energy efficiency, the energy appetite of  the internet continues to outstrip those gains thanks to its  dramatic growth. Critically, the internet’s growing energy  footprint has thus far been mostly concentrated in places  where energy is the dirtiest.  But there is good news to report: since our last report,  How Clean is Your Cloud? (April 2012),3 leading data  center operators have taken key steps toward building  a green internet, particularly those companies that have  committed to build a 100% renewably powered platform.  These commitments are having a profound impact in the  real world, shifting investment from legacy coal, gas and  nuclear power plants to renewable energy technologies,  and disrupting the status quo among major electric utilities.  In US states like North Carolina, Nevada and Iowa, these  companies’ commitments to clean energy are resulting in  large amounts of wind and solar power displacing coal, gas  and nuclear plants or preventing them from being built, to  the tangible benefit of the global climate and communities  living in those states.  The environmental rationale for technology companies  to act has been clear for many years, as a rapid shift to  renewable energy is necessary to stem the worst impacts  of climate change. Now, the business case is becoming  more compelling as well: costs for renewable energy  continue to drop, prices for fossil fuel-based electricity are  rising, and leading companies are perceiving those price  cues. They are also heeding customers who increasingly  value sustainability.  Unfortunately, despite the leadership and innovation  demonstrated by green internet pioneers, other companies  lag far behind, with little sense of urgency, choosing to  paper over their growing dirty energy footprints with status  quo solutions such as renewable energy credits and  carbon offsets while rapidly expanding their infrastructure.  Other internet companies have refused to pay even lip  service to sustainability, and are simply buying dirty energy  straight from the grid. Those companies, most notably  Amazon Web Services, are choosing how to power their  infrastructure based solely on lowest electricity prices,  without consideration to the impact their growing electricity  footprints have on human health or the environment.  A Green Internet is Crucial  for a Healthy Climate  We witness on a daily basis evidence that the foundation  of our offline world, our planet, is out of balance as a  result of climate change and other threats caused by  our reliance on dirty sources of energy. The scientific  community is issuing warnings, increasingly dire in nature,  that our continued reliance on the energy technologies  of the past is putting our future in grave danger. We need  to shift at internet-like speed to a world powered by  renewable sources of energy, disrupting the status quo  to which electric utilities and other fossil fuel providers are  desperately clinging.  We cannot make the transition to a renewable powered  society fast enough unless the internet is a platform leading  the world toward a clean energy future, and not building a  new attachment to our dirty energy past.  The pressing need for the internet to drive the clean  energy revolution is perhaps most evident in China, which  will host much of the internet’s growth in the decade to  come. China is also the country with the world’s largest  carbon footprint. As companies begin to build their  internet infrastructure there, acceptance of status quo  dirty energy would be disastrous for efforts to wean China  off of polluting energy sources. Innovative approaches  to clean energy procurement, by contrast, could be  transformational there.  Major brands are taking meaningful steps to steer their  infrastructure investments toward cleaner energy, but the  sector as a whole remains focused on rapid growth. Most  companies still are myopic to the critical nature of their  energy choices, focusing only on maximizing efficiency.  The replacement of dirty sources of electricity with clean  renewable sources is still the crucial missing link in the  sector’s sustainability efforts.  With this year’s update, we have expanded our analysis to  examine a total of 19 global IT companies that are leading  the sector’s move to the cloud, including several major  colocation companies for the first time. These companies,  while less well-known than branded giants like Google  or Amazon, operate the data centers behind much of  the Internet. As a function of that expanded analysis, this  update now includes over 300 data centers in our survey,  up from approximately 80 in the previous edition. We  have updated our evaluation to account for how these  colocation companies are pursuing opportunities to play a  meaningful role in driving renewable energy deployment to  meet the internet’s energy needs.  Key Findings  (1) Six major cloud brands – Apple, Box, Facebook,  Google, Rackspace, and Salesforce – have committed  to a goal of powering data centers with 100 %  renewable energy and are providing the early signs  of the promise and potential impact of a renewably  powered internet.  (2) A number of leading brands, most notably Apple and  Facebook, have made significant improvements in  their energy transparency, discarding the previous  dogma within the sector of withholding energy data  due to competitiveness concerns. Transparency still  remains weak overall among many brands, particularly  colocation providers.  (3) Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides the  infrastructure for a significant part of the internet,  remains among the dirtiest and least transparent  companies in the sector, far behind its major  competitors, with zero reporting of its energy or  environmental footprint to any source or stakeholder.  Twitter lags in many of the same areas.  (4) As a result of pressure by three major brands (Apple,  Facebook and Google) located in North Carolina,  Duke Energy, the largest utility in the US, adopted a  Green Source Rider, opening the market to renewable  electricity purchases for large customers in North  Carolina.  (5) Google maintains its leadership in building a renewably  powered internet, as it significantly expands its  renewable energy purchasing and investment both  independently and through collaboration with its utility  vendors.  (6) Facebook continues to prove its commitment to build a  green internet, with its decision to locate a data center  in Iowa driving the largest purchase of wind turbines in  the world.  (7) Apple is the most improved company since our last full  report, and has shown itself to be the most innovative  and most aggressive in pursuing its commitment to be  100% renewably powered.    Information Technology (IT) companies have  a central role to play in enabling a modern,  renewable-powered energy infrastructure.  An estimated 2.5 billion people are currently  online, and that number is expected to increase  by nearly 60% in the next five years.4 If the  rapid growth of the digital economy is linked to  renewable energy sources, the IT sector has the  opportunity to catalyze transformative change  in the consumption and production of energy,  with the potential to drive a significant reduction  in the greenhouse gases (GHGs) that cause  climate change.  Powering the Digital Economy  Despite significant improvement in transparency from  some companies since 2012, estimates of the energy  demand of our growing number of electronic devices  and the online world to which they are connected have  varied widely in their methodology and scope. Many of  the existing studies are based on country samples, annual  surveys or industry predictions that are difficult to compare  due to variant methods and areas of focus between the  three different parts of the internet system: data centers,  communication networks and end user devices.  One of the most comprehensive and well recognized  snapshots of the internet’s energy demand at the global  level is the SMART 2020 report (2008), and the update in  2012, the SMARTer 2020 report, which pegs IT-related  emissions at approximately 2% of global emissions, on par  with emissions from the global aviation sector.  The updated analysis of the SMARTer 2020 report shows  the relative shift in the energy footprint of the IT sector from  devices to data center and networks, tracking the ongoing  growth of internet-based computing and the shift to thin  client devices like tablets. Data centers will be the fastest  growing part of the global IT sector energy footprint as our  online world rapidly expands; their energy demand will  increase 81% by 2020.  Based on the estimates contained in the SMARTer 2020  analysis, the aggregate electricity demand of the cloud  (including data centers and networks, but not devices) in  2011 was 684 billion kWh. If compared with the electricity  demand of countries in the same year, the cloud would  rank 6th in the world, with demand expected to increase  63% by 2020.The US remains the largest consumer of data center  power globally, followed by Japan, the UK, Germany  and France. Emerging markets in Latin America, China,  Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Poland and Turkey are  countries where power demand is growing above the  global average (See China ” The Cloud’s Next Stop: China”  on page 17). Global power demand for data centers alone  grew to an estimated 40GW in 2013, an increase of 7%  over 2012.Data Drivers  Internet data will almost triple from 2012-2017, growing  from 44 to 121 exabytes.8 Streaming video and audio are  the biggest drivers of explosive data growth, along with  a 50% increase in the number of internet users globally.  Netflix and YouTube combined represent more that 50%  of internet traffic at peak times in North America.9 Globally,  YouTube remains the largest single source of data growth,  but social media services Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest  are also growing rapidly.    Power for a Green Internet  is Growing Rapidly  Renewable energy is available to power the Internet: the  transition to a clean energy economy is underway, driven  by the increasingly competitive price of renewable power  compared to fossil fuels. Germany is leading the way with  25% of its electricity coming from renewable sources,  and targets of 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. More and  more studies show how renewable energy can provide all  future power needs for countries across the globe; indeed,  countries like Scotland, Denmark and the Philippines have  now set targets to be 100% renewable powered.  In 2012, over half of all new installed electric capacity  worldwide came from renewable sources. In the EU  the share was almost 70%, mostly due to solar and  wind power growth. The US added more capacity from  wind power than any other energy form in 2012, and all  renewable energy made up about half of total electric  capacity additions during the year.10 Solar is booming  in the US as well, following in wind energy’s footsteps; in  2013, solar energy accounted for 29% of all new electric  generation capacity, up from 10% in 2012.In the US, there are now nine states that are getting 10%  or more of their electricity from wind power, with Iowa  (25%) – a data center hub – topping the list.12 In China,  wind energy produced 135TWh in 2013 – 22% more  power than all of the country’s nuclear reactors.Fossil Fuels: Barriers to a Green Internet  While penetration of renewable energy technologies  like wind and solar energy has grown rapidly in the past  decade, legacy energy generation from coal, gas and  nuclear power remains the status quo for most parts of  the world. To prevent the most dangerous climate change  (brought on by global warming of 2 °C or more), global  emissions must peak before 2020. The International  Energy Agency (IEA) states that most proven reserves of  fossil fuels must stay in the ground in order to meet those  goals.Coal is the chief culprit for global greenhouse gas (GHG)  pollution.15 A combination of energy efficiency, activism,  environmental regulations and cheaper gas has started a  wave of coal plant shutdowns in the US in recent years,  and caused a halt in the construction of new coal-fired  power plants.16 However, coal is still the source for  approximately 40 % of electricity in the US,17 and is still  burnt for electric generation around the world. It should be  the energy source most avoided by IT companies when  making decisions about how to power their data centers.    Is it green?  Nuclear: Nuclear power plants create unacceptable  risk to the environment and human health and are an  expensive diversion from the deployment of renewable  energy and energy efficiency required to stave off the  worst impacts of global warming. Efforts to revive  the nuclear industry in the US have failed due to the  impossibly high costs of building and maintaining  nuclear power plants – that money is best spent on  renewable sources of power.Hydropower: Hydropower is the most established  baseload clean energy source. Sourcing energy for a  data center from existing hydropower reduces carbon  emissions and is more environmentally friendly than  powering from a predominantly coal, gas, or nuclear  powered grid. However, using existing hydropower  does not lead to investment in new renewable energy  capacity, and large hydropower projects can have  detrimental effects on local environments. Wellplanned  and managed small-scale or microhydro  power projects have much less impact on river  ecosystems, and have the potential to provide a  scalable baseload power source for data centers.  Geothermal: Geothermal energy is a consistent and  renewable source of power in areas of the world where  it can be found. It provides significant and growing  electric generation in countries like the US, Iceland,  and Indonesia. In 2013, 600MW of new geothermal  power was added globally.21 Apple has recently  secured electricity for its Reno data center for local  geothermal sources.Biogas: Biogas can come from many sources;  methane from landfill sites and anaerobic digestion of  farm waste or sewage sludge are the most common.  The environmental benefits of biogas vary widely  depending on the source.  Biomass: Large-scale biomass used for electricity  generation can create significant environmental  problems, as the source of biomass is likely to come  from unsustainable sources. Wood pellets from the  southeast US are currently being shipped to the UK  and other parts of the EU, simultaneously driving  deforestation and undermining climate protection  goals in both countries.Dont Frack the Internet  In the US, utilities have vastly increased their generation  of electricity from gas obtained from unconventional  reserves, known as “shale gas” or “tight gas.” Shale gas  requires drillers to crack the reservoir rock using a process  known as hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracture methods  (“fracking”) are associated with a range of environmental  impacts, including the pollution of local groundwater.  While natural gas from conventional reserves has a lower  carbon intensity than coal, it still generates significant  GHG emissions.The GHG footprint of shale gas may be  significantly greater than for conventional gas, with some  life-cycle analyses showing shale gas to have a GHG  footprint that is higher than even coal, due to fugitive  methane emissions that are leaked during gas extraction  and transportation.18 While the increasing supply of natural  gas due to fracking has helped to shut down a number of  coal plants, shale gas also diverts investment away from  renewable energy.A small but increasing number of data center companies  are deploying natural gas-powered fuel cells on site as  both primary and backup power supplies. Natural gas  used in fuel cells creates less pollution than when it is  combusted in power plants, and fuel cells can be a good  mitigation strategy when used as a primary power source  to unplug a data center from a coal-fired grid (See “eBay  unplugs from a dirty grid: p 29). Nonetheless, natural gas  cannot be considered renewable even when used in fuel  cells.    China has 618 million internet users and is the single  largest internet market on the planet,24 with more people  online than inhabitants of Western Europe. In 2012 alone,  almost 53.5 million people came online in China – a rate of  1.7 new online users per second. China will add another  200 million users by 2015,25 with most accessing the  internet via mobile technology.  Internet companies are growing rapidly to provide  services for the new market. China’s largest internet  company, Tencent, ranked as the 4th largest in the world  by market capitalization, behind only Google, Facebook  and Amazon.26 In addition to Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and  Sina (owner of Weibo) are the biggest internet companies  in China. Both Tencent and Alibaba are expanding into  international markets. These companies are investing  billions of dollars in new Chinese data centers to match  their explosive growth.The rapid growth in internet use in China means huge  quantities of electricity will be needed to power internet  and online mobile services. Between 1.5% (700TWh) and  3% (1412TWh) of all electricity generation in China was  used for the internet in 2011, according to estimates.That power comes from a national grid that is currently  dominated by coal.  Chinese IT companies have been introducing energy  efficiency measures to reduce power consumption, but  the rapid growth in demand for online services means any  carbon savings are quickly overwhelmed, and emissions  from the Chinese IT sector will continue to grow unless  aggressive energy efficiency targets are combined with  prioritizing renewable energy sources.  International internet companies are all looking at options  to grab a share of the Chinese market. Amazon has just  announced plans for a Chinese-hosted AWS China Region  and IBM has plans to build its own Chinese data center29,30.  Industry experts are predicting that China will become the  key location for data center construction in the coming  years.Until 2012, any company plugging into the grid in China  had no choice over its source of power. However, the  Chinese Government is now acting to cap the growth of  coal power in key regions to tackle its air pollution crisis,  and is introducing ambitious renewable energy targets  to transition China’s electricity generation toward clean  energy. 32 In 2013, China increased its solar target to  35GW by 2015 and enacted new policies to allow private  solar installations to connect to the grid and achieve  attractive economic terms for the power they generate.The changes represent a crucial opportunity for internet  companies and data center operators in China to invest  directly in clean energy and slash their growing energy bills.  IKEA34 and Lenovo35 are investing in their own solar PV  installations in China. China’s top internet companies have  yet to take advantage of the new opportunities to invest  in solar power, as sector leaders Apple, Facebook and  Google are doing in the US.    Defining a Green  Internet Company  The IT sector has made substantial progress in driving  innovation in data center and server energy efficiency  design in the past 5-plus years, which is helping to curb the  expected growth in data center energy demand. However,  given the scale of predicted growth in the energy footprint  of the online world, all major online companies must  factor access to renewable sources of electricity into any  meaningful sustainability strategy. At both a company and  a sector level, delivering a green internet has to include a  long-term commitment to growing with renewable energy,  and a near-term strategy that will put both existing demand  and future growth on a path to being 100% renewably  powered.  The environmental rationale for technology companies  to act has been clear for many years, as a rapid shift to  renewable energy is necessary to stem the worst impacts  of climate change. Now, the business case is becoming  more compelling as well: costs for renewable energy  continue to drop, prices for fossil fuel-based electricity are  rising, and leading companies are perceiving those price  cues. They are also heeding customers who increasingly  value sustainability.  Fortunately, several leading companies have recently  made meaningful commitments to embed within their  business model the goal of a renewably powered internet,  and taken steps to implement those goals. These  leaders recognize their rapid energy demand growth as  a responsibility, but also as an opportunity to disrupt the  status quo in the energy sector and ensure their longterm  sustainability. While each company will have different  opportunities depending on their business model and  geographic location, key ingredients for any company  that wants to build their part of the internet with renewable  energy must include:  • A long-term commitment to become 100%  renewably powered.  • A commitment to transparency on IT performance  and consumption of resources, including the source  of electricity, to enable customers, investors, and  stakeholders to measure progress toward that goal.  • A strategy for improving energy efficiency while  increasing the supply of renewable energy, through a  mixture of procurement, investment, and corporate  advocacy to both electricity suppliers and government  decision-makers.  By making better energy choices and demanding more  from utility vendors, some internet companies are already  demonstrating their ability to be critical catalysts in driving  utilities and governments toward the development of  cleaner electricity generation that will ensure a truly green  online world – and a greener offline world for us all.    I. Energy Transparency  It is not possible to properly assess whether a company  or its products are sustainable without adequate  transparency on the company’s inputs and outputs. Just  a few years ago, while there were a number of companies  touting how “green” the cloud or their cloud was, very few,  if any, offered useful details on one of the biggest inputs  into a data center: electricity. The sector was reluctant  to discuss electricity use in any level of detail, as if IT  companies had adopted a collective code of silence.  Fortunately, we are beginning to see a meaningful shift  among leading data center operators, particularly within  the last two years, to acknowledging that revealing energy  information is no longer equivalent to publishing the  secret formula for Coca-Cola. Business and government  customers increasingly want to know key data points  on the environmental performance of facilities to which  they have “off-shored” their computing capacity, as  they have goals on carbon reduction and renewable  energy they expect their cloud provider to help them  achieve. Customers need reliable data to evaluate the  environmental performance and carbon footprint of their IT  vendors and suppliers. Among the major cloud providers,  only Amazon refuses to provide any details on the energy  performance and environmental impact associated with its  operations.  Despite the adoption by the Green Grid of new data  center environmental performance metrics like Carbon  Utilization Effectiveness (CUE, to measure carbon intensity)  and Green Energy Coefficient (GEC, to indicate the  amount of renewable energy),36 the number of companies  reporting under these new metrics remains quite low,  though there has been some recent improvement. eBay  provides the best example, including CUE as part of its  regularly updated Digital Service Effectiveness dashboard,  illustrating the performance connection between  environmental and business metrics.II. Renewable Energy  Commitment & Siting Policy  Starting with Facebook in 2011, six major cloud  companies have now made long-term commitments to  be 100% renewably powered (Apple, Box, Facebook,  Google, Salesforce and Rackspace). These commitments  send a powerful signal to both utilities and colocation  providers that if they expect to earn the business of these  companies, they will need to provide a strategy for how  they can help them achieve this goal.  Site selection is a critical decision for determining the nearterm  sustainability of the facility, whether a company is  building or renting data center space. Location has a large  impact on what options are available to leverage outside  air cooling, as well as access to renewable energy sources.  These six companies and others have also strengthened  the weighting of access to renewable electricity in their  site selection criteria and energy policies, as shown by  Facebook and through the energy policies published by  Google38 and Apple. “ Utilities are now much more  interested in collaborating  with us, and I think we are at  the beginning of a period in  which we could see a very  rapid change in the energy mix  utilities are providing in just a  few short years” Bill Weihl, Facebook Manager of Energy  Efficiency and Sustainability    III. Energy Efficiency and  Mitigation Strategy  Energy efficiency is a critical element in each aspect of  operating a data center: data center design to reduce  energy spent on cooling; energy efficient servers; and  software and load management strategies to maximize  utilization of data center compute capacity. Improvements  in the utilization of data center compute resources has  been a key factor in curbing the rate of growth across the  sector.  Those companies which own and operate their own  facilities are already aggressively managing energy use,  and many have begun to collaborate in sharing and  developing more efficient facilities with peer operators  as well as many equipment manufacturers (see “Open  Compute Project shows potential of collective action”  p 30). While some companies still conflate their energy  efficiency with operating a green data center, often with  little in the way of comparative data to substantiate their  claims, leading companies such as Akamai, Yahoo and  IBM are setting clear benchmarks for improving the  energy efficiency and carbon intensity of their operations,  and regularly report their progress to stakeholders and  customers.  IV. Clean Energy Strategy  The options for securing a greater supply of renewable  energy for data center operators varies significantly  depending on their business model (cloud, colocation or  managed hosting) and the options available to them by the  state or utility to choose their electricity supply or electricity  supplier.  Moving away from RECs  With a few notable exceptions, the trend away from simply  buying renewable energy credits (RECs) as a means of  achieving environmental performance goals has continued  and accelerated among data center companies. By  themselves, RECs (and their cousins carbon offsets) are  largely instruments that preserve the status quo, as they  do little to increase the amount of renewable energy on  the grid, or displace dirty sources of electricity.40 RECs  also do not provide any meaningful return on investment,  as companies must continue to “rent” the right to claim  they are renewably powered each year. Companies  that buy them should only do so when they do not have  more meaningful options for securing renewable energy  in the locations available to them. If companies do buy  RECs, they must at a bare minimum buy RECs that  demonstrate strong additionality, and are in close proximity  to the facilities they wish to claim are renewable. They  should otherwise look to make more direct investments  in renewable energy or push utility and government  policymakers to add more renewable energy on the grid,  allowing customers to have the right to directly contract  for it.  Utility-based Strategies to Procure  Renewable Energy  Renewable Grid Power  Options for grid-supplied renewable electricity for a  data center operator depend upon the location of the  data center, its proximity to available renewable energy  generation capacity, and the investment strategy of the  respective utility. High availability of low-cost hydroelectric  or renewable sources of energy has led many companies  to locate in the Pacific Northwest in the US (hydropower),  Iceland (geothermal), and Sweden (hydro and wind).  “ Our goal is to power  every facility at Apple entirely  with energy from renewable  sources — solar, wind, hydro,  and geothermal” Apple Facilities Report  on Renewable Energy  Investment in renewable energy  While renewable energy and energy efficient technologies  continue to develop and grow, there are still significant  gaps in private-sector financing needed to deploy them at  scale across many markets. IT companies such as Google  have demonstrated significant interest (over $1 billion  invested) in making direct clean energy investments.Google’s investments have created much higher impact  than when companies purchase RECs; such investment  can provide much-needed capital for the development and  deployment of renewable energy, as opposed to RECs,  which only “rent” the clean attributes of renewable energy  generated by others. Investments can be structured so  that the investing company becomes an owner of the  project, or is only providing capital for the tax equity portion  of the project.  V. Advocacy  In order to ensure that the supply of clean energy can  keep pace with a data center’s growing electricity demand  over its lifetime, companies need to at a minimum make  a corporate commitment to engage in energy policy  decisions in regions where they establish operations. As  large commercial consumers of electricity, IT companies  have standing with utilities and policy-makers to influence  acceleration in the investment and deployment of the clean  electricity supply, enabling data centers to operate on  100% renewable energy. Companies can support:  • Adoption of renewable energy investment incentives,  including those specific to the IT sector for energy  efficiency and renewable energy deployment.  • Deployment of cost-effective, regionally appropriate  sources of renewable power generation for data centers,  and the retirement of coal-fired generation.  • Increased distributed generation to drive greater  deployment of renewable energy, which increases  grid stability and enables the retirement of older, dirtier  centralized generation. Facebook and Microsoft recently  advocated for this in Iowa.• Investment in the development of grid infrastructure and  energy storage technology to enable higher utilization of  variable renewable energy sources, such as wind and  solar.  • Greater availability of options for renewable energy  procurement, especially in states with monopoly utilities  that do not allow third-party sales of electricity.  Renewable Energy Tariff Programs  A number of utilities have recently established renewable  energy tariffs, or green tariffs, as a means of offering  a renewable class of electricity service to interested  customers, often at the behest of major data center  operators.41 Utilities in regulated markets in the US, such  as North Carolina and Virginia, which otherwise offer very  low percentages of renewable energy in their generation  mix, have been among those to offer renewable energy  tariffs.  Direct Access  Direct Access programs allow the customer to purchase  electricity from a different generator than the utility,  potentially creating stronger options for securing a  renewable electricity supply. Direct access is not available  in every jurisdiction, and is often made difficult by utilities  aiming to discourage participation.  Non-Utility Strategies to  Procure Renewable Energy  On-Site Generation  A growing number of data center operators have installed  renewable or alternative generation technology (primarily  fuel cells) on site to generate power for their facilities. The  declining cost of solar technology, along with tax incentives  available in many jurisdictions, has made solar an  increasingly attractive option for some facilities. However,  it may be difficult technically or economically for many data  centers to power a significant portion of their electricity  needs with on-site renewable energy, unless there is  nearby land available, as Apple had in North Carolina.  In jurisdictions that allow third-party sales of electricity,  it may be possible for data center operators to allow the  renewable technology to be owned and operated by third  parties.  Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)  An increasing number of cloud companies, such as  Google and Microsoft, have begun to take charge of their  electricity supply chain by signing long-term contracts to  buy renewable electricity from a specific source through  a utility or renewable energy developer via a power  purchase agreement (PPA), which helps to increase the  supply of renewable electricity onto the grid, and provides  the purchaser an effective buffer against rising or volatile  electricity prices.  “ The wonderful thing about  power purchase agreements  for clean energy is that they’re  at a fixed price, unlike brown  power costs which are going  up” Gary Demasi, Google Director  of Global Infrastructure.    Your Online  World: Green  IRL, or #dirty?  From social media to music, streaming video,  email and commerce, we are increasingly  moving much of our lives online. That means a  lot of new data to store. But where is that data  being stored, which companies are storing it,  and what kind of energy are they using?  Unlike internet giants like Google and Facebook, most  online companies do not, in fact, own their own data  centers. Most internet sites, video streaming services,  and cloud based storage services operate in data centers  managed by other companies, paying rent to digital  landlords that rent data center space or computing and  storage capacity. Many companies have turned to Amazon  Web Services to host their data, a problematic trend as  long as Amazon continues to power its data centers with  dirty forms of energy.  In the graphic on the next page, we offer a sampling to  show where some of the internet’s most popular sites and  services are being hosted – and the relative greenness  of the energy that those data centers are using. Energy  demand symbols are not drawn to scale and are meant  to offer a relative indication. For more information on the  energy footprints of each hosting company, see “Company  Scores Explained” starting on page 44.   Clicking Clean:  How Companies  are Creating the  Green Internet  Section Green Internet  Leaders and  Best Practices  II. Energy Efficiency & Mitigation  Greenhouse Gas Mitigation:  eBay Unplugs From a Dirty Grid  The electricity grid surrounding eBay’s Topaz data center  in Utah is one of the dirtiest in the United States, with  over 60% of the electricity still coming from coal-fired  generation.47 To address its outsized carbon footprint for  Topaz, eBay has chosen to effectively “unplug” its facility  from the local grid as its primary power source, relying  instead upon on-site fuel cells powered by natural gas  for 75% of its electricity needs, and using the grid only as  backup power in case of fuel cell failure.48 In addition, eBay  is currently financing a combined heat and power project  at a nearby facility, which it uses to offset the carbon  emissions produced by the natural gas powered fuel cells.  While fuel cells powered by natural gas are not renewable,  eBay’s innovative approach highlights the potential to use  distributed generation to power the cloud in certain areas,  rather than driving further utility investment in centralized  fossil fuel generation.  Honorable Mention: IBM, for repeated strong performance  on emissions reduction goals, and its patent for shifting  cloud computing demands on a distributed network to  meet environmental impact criteria.I. Energy Transparency  Energy Performance Transparency:  Facebook opens its books  Facebook dramatically improved its energy transparency  just a few months after it became a publicly traded  company in 2012, and now provides one of the most  accessible snapshots of its energy footprint in the sector.  Facebook now annually publishes its energy and carbon  footprint across its entire operations, and has also added  facility-specific performance dashboards45 to provide  nearly real-time reporting of the Power Usage Effectiveness  (PUE) and Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE) of its data  centers. Facebook recently open-sourced the code for  those dashboards.46 While many companies remain  reluctant to provide facility-level information, Facebook  sets a high bar for others to meet by allowing its users to  follow the platform’s progress toward becoming 100%  renewably powered.    Energy Efficiency:  Open Compute Project  shows potential of collective  action (Multiple Companies)  Launched initially by Facebook in 2011, the Open  Compute Project (OCP) seeks to replicate the success  of the open-source software model in data center and  server design.50 OCP aims to spur improvements in energy  efficiency across the sector, which is critical to building an  internet that can be renewably powered. With participating  companies sharing their hardware designs, OCP could  disrupt the status quo among server manufacturers, a key  sector vendor, allowing best practices to drive the market  more quickly. While OCP’s impacts are still emerging, the  project shows the potential of collective action in tackling  the sector’s energy footprint.  OCP provides one model for how internet companies  could approach another key vendor, electric utilities, to  accelerate the deployment of renewable energy. Such a  collective approach could have a truly disruptive effect  on the status quo in the utility sector, which is stubbornly  clinging to outdated models of centralized, polluting power  plants. That type of effort would ultimately help both the  internet and utility sectors accelerate their transition to  sustainable business models based on renewable energy.  III. Siting Policy & Commitment to  Renewable Energy  Commitment to Renewable Energy: Rackspace,  Salesforce, and Box Show That Renters Can Buy  Renewable Too  Three rapidly growing cloud companies, Rackspace,  Salesforce and Box, all adopted 100% renewable energy  policies in 2013.51,52,53 These commitments show that the  desire and motivation to build a green internet is not limited  to big public brands or those that own and operate their  own data centers. While internet companies enjoy a more  limited set of options to meaningfully procure renewable  energy when they do not own their facilities, commitments  by such prominent and fast-growing cloud brands create  important pressure on colocation companies to offer their  best customers real options for green hosting.  The launch of companies such as GreenQloud and Green  Mountain, data center operators in Iceland and Norway  respectively, are evidence of the rising demand for cleaner  options in the colocation sector. Rackspace’s sustainability  director described why they set the ambitious 100 %  renewable goal at a Greenpeace forum in November,  saying: “Our customers simply expect green energy.”  Renewable Energy Commitment & Siting Policy:  Facebook harnesses Iowa’s wind  Facebook adopted a strong preference for renewable  energy supply in its data center siting policy in 2011 to  support its long-term commitment to make the platform  100% powered by renewable energy. The company  showed the power of that siting policy in April, 2013,  when it announced plans to build its fourth data center in  Iowa, choosing the state over neighboring Nebraska in  part because Iowa had better policies and a more willing  utility to help Facebook meet its renewable goals. Just two  Google increases  transparency on its data  center energy use  Google releases information  on exactly how much energy  it takes to provide searches,  email, youtube videos and  all other Google services, as  well as its energy mix.  Facebook to renewable  energy siting policy for  data centers  Facebook commits to a  siting policy with a stated  preference to locate data  centers in areas with  renewable energy available,  bringing to a close the 20-  month Greenpeace Unfriend  Coal campaign.  Apple commits to  100 % renewable  energy for iCloud  Apple announces a doubling  of its solar installation at its  North Carolina data center,  along with a commitment  that all of its data centers  will be powered by 100 %  renewable energy.    Green Internet  Leaders and  Best Practices  In North Carolina, Apple’s large-scale solar investment,  made economically feasible in part by its ability to leverage  tax incentives against other parts of its business, helped  propel North Carolina to third place in 2013 among US  states in solar growth.58 Apple’s solar installations, in  combination with pressure for better energy options that  it applied along with data center neighbors Facebook and  Google, led Duke Energy to offer a new tier of renewable  electricity service. Duke’s new Green Source Rider  program is geared to prevent losing additional business to  increased solar investments from customers like Apple.In Nevada, Apple’s solar installation broke new ground for  renewable energy from the local utility, NV Energy, which  agreed to work in partnership with Apple to co-develop a  solar project and adopt a Green Energy rate tariff. That tariff  opened the door for other companies to explore renewable  energy options, showing the catalytic power that data  center operators can have when they push for more  renewable energy.  Google Greens the Grid with Renewable Purchases  at Unprecedented Scale  Google has continued to lead the charge among major  IT brands by signing five long-term power purchase  agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy,60 helping to  green the grid for its data centers in Iowa,61 Oklahoma,and Finland63 to date. Google has also worked to expand  its options for green electricity in Oklahoma to include  buying directly from the utility, resulting in the utility making  its first ever renewable energy investment.64 In addition to  greening its data centers, Google has invested over $1  billion in 15 renewable energy projects, such as the world’s  largest solar plant in Southern California, collectively good  for 2 GW of clean power.weeks after Facebook’s announcement, MidAmerican  Energy, the local utility in Iowa, announced plans to invest  $1.9 billion to increase its wind generation by 1,050MW.  That plan simultaneously marked the largest investment  in Iowa’s history54 and the world’s largest order of wind  turbines.Facebook has since announced it has an agreementwith MidAmerican to purchase energy from a new wind  project nearby its data center to allow it to fully power the  facility with renewable energy, but its desire for renewable  energy clearly had a much larger catalytic role in Iowa – and  potentially in Nebraska as well. Facebook’s decision to  spurn Nebraska has spurred debate in that state legislature  to strengthen policies to support renewable energy  investment, so that Nebraska can be more competitive for  future data center business.IV. Renewable Energy  Deployment & Advocacy  A) Renewable Energy Deployment  Apple applies innovation to on-site solar in Nevada  and North Carolina  Apple has done the most of any data center operator to  make its part of the internet green through the on-site  installation of renewable energy, particularly solar power.  For both its Maiden, North Carolina and Reno, Nevada  data centers, Apple is deploying large solar farms on site  or at nearby locations to provide a significant amount of  new renewable energy to meet its data center electricity  needs and fulfill its goal to be 100% renewably powered  and coal-free.  eBay quits the coal grid  for its Utah data center  eBay installs fuel cells  for its Utah data center,  setting them up in a way  that allows the facility to  run independently from  the electricity grid, which  is heavily powered by coal  there.  Facebook publishes  its energy and carbon  footprint data for first  time  Facebook publishes  its 2011 energy and  carbon footprint data and  announced a 2015 goal  of powering 25% of the  platform with renewable  energy.  Rackspace commits to  100 % renewable energy  Rackspace commits to a  goal of powering its data  centers with 100 % clean  energy.  Salesforce commits to  100 % renewable energy  Salesforce becomes the  fifth company to commit to  powering its cloud with 100  % clean energy.    In purchasing and investing in renewable energy at scale,  Google is also developing options that can be seized  by others. Google’s earlier PPA in Iowa contributed to  MidAmerican’s decision to dramatically expand its wind  generation capacity and enter into an agreement to provide  Facebook wind energy directly.  B. Advocacy  Apple, Google, Facebook try to make NC into a  Clean Data Triangle  North Carolina has been a hot spot for data center  expansion (see “Where the Cloud Touches the Ground”,  p 40), featuring major facilities operated by three of the  largest internet brands, Apple, Facebook and Google. The  dirty energy mix offered by utility Duke Energy to these  large electricity customers prompted a North Carolina  newspaper in 2011 to ask whether the companies were  creating a “Dirty Data Triangle.”Since then, all three of the companies have developed  long-term commitments to be 100% renewably powered.  The companies successfully teamed up with others to  compel Duke Energy, the nation’s largest utility and one  of its biggest emitters of global warming pollution, to offer  renewable energy to its major customers through a special  “Green Source Rider.”67 While not perfect, the program  represents an important shift in North Carolina, particularly  coming from a utility that has sold only a one-size-fits-all  dirty energy offering for decades. Google, Facebook and  Apple’s leadership shows how innovative companies can  disrupt the status quo, and how the online world can drive  green behavior in the offline world, even wrestling changes  from recalcitrant utilities, when IT leaders work together.  Apple report reveals  its path to 100%  renewable energy  Apple releases an  environmental report  disclosing how it would  reach 100 % renewable  energy for its data centers  allowing customers to have  faith that Apple is meeting its  ambitions with real action.  Apple, Facebook,  Google Team Up to Push  Nation’s Largest Utility  to Renewable Energy  Offering  Apple, Facebook and  Google team up to compel  their electric utility in North  Carolina, Duke Energy, to  offer a new breakthrough  renewable energy program.  Apple chooses solar for  Nevada data center  Apple announces it will work  with the local utility to power  its data center near Reno,  NV with 100 % solar and  geothermal power.  Microsoft makes its first  large-scale purchase  of renewable energy to  power a data center  Microsoft purchases wind  energy in Texas to power its  data center there, marking  its first ever large-scale  purchase of renewable  energy.    A Stain on IT clean energy efforts: ALEC  Some of the same companies using innovative  strategies to power the internet with renewable  energy are undermining those very efforts via their  political support for organizations which are actively  committed to sabotaging the clean energy revolution  and efforts to address climate change.  The most troubling of these political affiliations  is the membership by many IT companies in the  American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a  group that allows member corporations to pay to  ghostwrite model legislation for mostly right-wing  state legislators around the country. ALEC members  evaluated in this report  Google  • Facebook  • Microsoft  • Yahoo!  • eBay  • Verizon Terremark  ALEC is actively collaborating with many of the  nation’s worst polluters to kill clean energy and climate  policies around the country. In 2013, ALEC pushed  model legislation to repeal renewable energy portfolio  standards in over a dozen states, failing across the  board.The group’s 2014 agenda includes continued assaults  on renewable energy laws, plus a new effort to  attack net metering policies,72 which encourage the  growth of decentralized solar energy by allowing solar  customers to be fairly compensated for extra electricity  they sell back to the grid. ALEC is also targeting the  Environmental Protection Agency’s effort to limit global  warming pollution from coal-fired power plants.In addition to their membership in ALEC, Google and  Facebook also attracted criticism in 2013 for offering  political contributions to the Competitive Enterprise  Institute, a conservative think tank funded by fossil fuel  interests with a history of denying the reality of climate  change.Box becomes sixth  company to commit to  100 % renewable energy  Box becomes the sixth  and latest company to join  the growing club of global  technology firms who have  committed to powering their  cloud computing operations  with 100 % renewable  energy.  Apple begins powering  manufacturing with  renewable energy too  Apple announces it will start  building high-tech glass  for its products in Arizona  at a facility that will be 1% powered by solar and  geothermal energy.  Facebook powers new  Iowa data center with 1% wind energy  Facebook announces that it  will use 100% wind energy  to power its data center in  Iowa.    Section Where the  Cloud Touches  the Ground  Data center operators have followed each  other to different regions, forming data center  hubs that create concentrated pockets of high  electricity demand. Those data center hot spots  push utilities to build new electricity generation  that can harm both the local environment and  the broader climate if fueled by gas or coalfired  power plants. The clusters could also  drive utilities to invest in clean energy if the data  center operators demand it. Three regions in the  US which feature explosive data center growth  are North Carolina, the Pacific Northwest, and  Virginia.    Data Centers in the US  The US has more data centers than any other country. Below, some  of the regions that have been data center hot spots, their energy  mixes, and projected growth of renewable energy.  North Carolina  North Carolina has become a hot spot for data centers in  recent years, led by the high-profile entrances of Google,  Facebook and Apple into the state. Others have joined  them, including Walt Disney, AT&T, Wipro, Bed, Bath &  Beyond and others.As a result, data center electricity demand nearly tripled in  North Carolina from 2010 to 2012, according to data filed  by the local utility there, Duke Energy. Since Duke enjoys  a virtual monopoly on electricity sales in the state, its load  has grown considerably due to this data center investment  – and that load is powered by one of the dirtiest energy  mixes in the country. Duke generated 57 % of its electricity  in 2013 from nuclear power plants, 38% from coal, and 4  % from gas.78 A mere 0.1 % of their electricity came from  renewable sources like wind and solar power.79 Duke has  shown little ambition to get cleaner – its resource planning  documents show that in 2028, it still intends to generate  only 3 % of its energy from renewable sources.Internet companies’ growth in North Carolina gives them  a great deal of leverage over Duke – an official from the  utility once said that a data center “may be the most ideal  customer we could have.” Pacific Northwest  Oregon and Washington’s large data centers demanded  400 MW of electricity in 2012 and grew by almost 40 %  to 550 MW in 2013. A report from the Northwest Power  and Conservation Council estimated that data center  demand for the region could get “potentially as large as the  past aluminum industry in the region with loads in excess  ~2500 MWa”.Amazon’s data centers in Boardman, OR have grown so  quickly that it appears to have almost single-handedly  pushed its electricity provider, the Umatilla Electric  Cooperative, to a large enough size that it now is bound  by a state law to generate more renewable energy.Umatilla sought to avoid having to comply with the state’s  renewable energy requirement, financing a statewide ballot  initiative to redefine renewable energy to include 60-yearold  dams.84 Amazon has been content to let Umatilla do  just that, exerting none of its leverage as one of Umatilla’s  biggest customers to pressure the utility to call off its  assault on the law. In early 2014, Umatilla successfully  bullied its way into attaining a legislative loophole that  would allow it to comply with the law without investing in  wind and solar energy.Amazon’s course of inaction stands in stark contrast to  Apple, Google, Facebook and Rackspace, which operate  or are building data centers in Oregon, and are demanding  that their utilities provide more, not less, renewable energy.  In response, some utilities are asking the state for the ability  to provide more renewable energy to their data center  customers.  Virginia  Northern Virginia contains one of the most concentrated  epicenters of data centers in the world – it is a key location  in the internet’s infrastructure. Amazon operates multiple  data centers in the region, but is far from the only company  there. Much of the internet’s traffic is routed through this  area, and large amounts of federal government data are  stored in the region’s data centers as well.  Dominion, the utility in Virginia, services these data centers  with electricity. Its web site shows that data centers  demanded over 500 MW of electricity in 2012, a quantity  it expects to double by 2017. Unfortunately, Dominion’s  generation mix is comprised of almost entirely dirty  energy sources.87 Burning coal generates 38 % of the  state’s power; nuclear power plants generate 42 %; gas  generates 17 %. Renewable energy generates only 2 %  of the company’s power.88 Dominion’s long-term plan that  it submitted to regulators shows that it does not intended  on making any significant increase in its investment in  renewable energy over the next 15 years.  Clean energy index methodology (Column 2)  Greenpeace has established the Clean Energy Index as a  response to the lack of useful metrics and publicly available  data to evaluate and compare the energy footprints of  major cloud providers and their respective data centers.  This lack of data is not due to the fact that data does  not exist. However, most companies remain unwilling  to provide even the most basic information about both  the amount and source of their growing electricity  consumption. Despite a proliferation of metrics created by  the industry (such as PUE) that attempt to quantify how  green a data center is as measured by energy efficiency,  very few companies report under newer metrics (such as  Green Energy Coefficient, GEC) that could shed any light  on the basic question: how much dirty energy is being  used, and which companies are choosing clean energy to  power the cloud?  The Clean Energy Index attempts to provide a basic  answer to this question, based on what can be gleaned  from the limited information available, and focusing on  recent investments of select brands and the current clean  energy supply associated with each investment.  Starting with an initial set of some of the largest cloud  providers, Greenpeace has attempted to identify two main  inputs from a representative sample of their most recent  (five years or less) infrastructure investments.  Those inputs are:  (1) Estimated size of electricity demand of each facility (in  megawatts);  (2) Amount of renewable electricity being used to power it  (by percentage).  This information is then used to approximate, initially on a  facility level, the number of megawatts of clean energy the  facility will consume. Having calculated a facility-level Clean  Energy Index for a representative sample of data centers,  Greenpeace derives a company average of clean energy  percentage across its facilities.  In compiling the information included in this report,  Greenpeace contacted all companies featured here and  asked for information regarding their data center facilities,  and for information on their infrastructure siting and  mitigation efforts. Greenpeace made estimates of data  center power demand available to companies for comment  in advance of publication, and issues raised by the  companies are highlighted in footnotes on the scorecard.  The above inputs are from the following sources:  • Submissions by companies directly to Greenpeace  • Public submissions by companies to reporting entities or  stakeholder publications  • As defined by company when announcing investments  • As reported by the media (in stories on the investments or  construction of facilities, etc.)  • Electricity demand is derived by taking the announced  size of investment and deriving total number of MW, using  industry average cost per IT load ($15million US dollars  per MW) multiplied by publicly available PUE for facility or,  if not available, 1.5 for new facilities.  • If not reported by the company, the generation mix of the  electricity is taken from one of the following sources, as  available, in declining order of preference:  • The most recent published generation mix of the local  utility  • In the U.S., the 2010 eGrid State level generation mix  (9th Edition) as reported by US EPA, or if not applicable,  reported subregional eGrid generation mix  • Outside the US, the European Commission and  International Energy Agency 2009 Statistics  Important Note: This analysis does not attempt to  represent itself as a comprehensive snapshot of how much  clean energy is being consumed on a company-wide level.  Only the companies can properly provide that.  Greenpeace would welcome the opportunity to incorporate  more detailed data to inform our analysis, as that would  likely provide a more complete and refined picture of cloud  providers’ energy use. As companies provide better data,  Greenpeace will incorporate this into our evaluation and  encourage other companies to follow.  For those companies that have adopted 100% renewable  energy targets and also provide facility-level energy details,  Greenpeace uses current consumption and renewable  procurement data provided by the company instead of  ultimate facility capacity.

Achieving this transition relies upon addressing key energy  issues such as access to modern energy services, security of  supply and the sustainability of the energy mix. Environmental  degradation, increasing energy demand and unsustainable  resource use are critical development challenges that require  a coherent response. Renewable energy presents an  opportunity as it will play an essential role in advancing  sustainable development by providing millions with access to  energy, whilst helping ensure energy security, mitigating the  existential risk of climate change by reducing emissions, and  generating growth and employment.  The benefits associated with renewables are influencing how  countries meet their energy needs; the global increase in  renewable energy policies and investment attests to this. This  growth in the uptake of renewable energy - the “Silent  Revolution” - is playing out across the globe: over the last  decade 553,000 MW of renewable energy capacity has been  installed, with global total investment reaching a record $ 270  billion in 2014, and the cost of modern renewable energy  technologies continues to fall.  Accelerating the “Silent Revolution” globally requires  greater levels of commitment and cooperation to develop  enabling policy, combined with practical business  solutions. To facilitate this, policy makers, scientists and  businesses require access to up-to-date, relevant and  reliable data. Scenarios are a helpful aid for decision  making, by mapping out the complex issues and  information that must be considered. Through its  investigation of issues surrounding the future of energy, the  Global Energy [R]evolution 2015 makes an invaluable  contribution to informing decision-makers worldwide.  The Global Energy [R]evolution publication is an important  complement to IRENA’s efforts to provide knowledge and  expertise, and to facilitate the flow of information  encouraging the deployment of renewables. Therefore,  IRENA welcomes this fourth edition of the Global Energy  [R]evolution scenario, and the contribution the Global Wind  Energy Council, Solar Power Europe and Greenpeace have  made to the vital debate on transitioning the world to a  more secure and sustainable energy future.

Despite rising energy use, for the first time in 40 years,  global CO2 emissions associated with energy  consumption remained stable over the course of the year  while the global economy grew. The landmark  “decoupling” of economic and CO2 growth is due in large  measure to China’s increased use of renewable  resources, and efforts by countries in the OECD to  promote renewable energy and energy efficiency. This is  particularly encouraging in view of COP21 later this year  in Paris, where countries will announce and/or confirm  actions to mitigate climate change, setting the stage for  future investment in renewables and energy efficiency.  This decoupling clearly signals that renewables have  become a mainstream energy resource. The penetration  and use of both variable and non-variable renewables  are increasing, thereby contributing to diversification of  the energy mix. As of early 2015, 164 countries have  renewable energy targets in place. Many of these  countries have also engaged in an energy transition  path towards renewable energy and energy efficiency.  However, even with these successes, growth in  renewables capacity as well as improvements in energy  efficiency are below the rates necessary to achieve the  Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) goals of: doubling the  level of renewable energy; doubling the global rate of  improvement in energy efficiency; and providing universal  energy access by 2030.  We are still not on the pathway to 100% renewable energy  globally; a lot remains to be done particularly to increase  the use of renewables in the heating and transport  sectors. This latest edition of the Energy [R]evolution  provides insight of what needs to be done and where  renewable energy markets need to go. REN21 welcomes  the new Energy [R]evolution scenario as an important  contribution to the global energy policy debate. It provides  guidance on where investments need to reduce CO2  emissions below the carbon budget climate scientist have  identified to avoid runaway climate change.  The past decade has set the wheels in motion for a  global energy transition with renewables; it is  accelerating in many parts of the world. With the  implementation of ambitious targets and innovative  policies, renewables can continue to surpass  expectations and create a clean, equitable energy future.  Christine Lins    Introduction  The good news first: the Energy [R]evolution is already  happening! Since the first edition was published in 2005,  costs for wind power and solar photovoltaics (Pv) have  dropped dramatically and markets have grown substantially.  between 2005 and the end of 2014 over 496,000 MW of new  solar and wind power plants have been installed – equal to  the total capacity of all coal and gas power plants in Europe!  In addition 286,000 MW of hydro-, biomass- , concentrated  solar- and geothermal power plants have been installed,  totaling 783,000 MW of new renewable power generation  connected to the grid in the past decade – enough to supply  the current electricity demand of India and Africa combined.  Renewable power generation has become mainstream in  recent years. Onshore wind is already the most economic  power source for new capacity in a large and growing number  of markets, while solar Pv is likely to follow within the next 3  to 5 years. utilities in Europe, North America and around the  globe are feeling the pressure from renewables, and the old  business models are starting to erode. . In Germany, where  the capacity of solar Pv and wind power is equal to peak  demand, utilities like RWE and E.on struggle. More and more  customers generate their own power. The future business  model for utilities will have to change from selling kilowatthours  to selling energy services if they are to survive.  However, with all the good news from the renewable power  sector, the overall transition away from fossil and nuclear  fuels to renewables is far too slow to combat dangerous  climate change. During the past decade almost as much  capacity of new coal power plants has been installed as  renewables: 750,000 MW. Over 80% of the new capacity has  been added in China, where not only wind and solar power  lead their respective global markets, but also new coal.  but there are the first positive signs that the increase in coal  use is coming to an end in China. The amount of coal being  burned by China has fallen for the first time this century in  2014, according to an analysis of official statistics. China’s  booming coal in the last decade has been the major  contributor to the fast-rising carbon emissions that drive  climate change, making the first drop a significant moment.  100% renewables – a revolutionary idea gets more  and more support  Phasing out nuclear and fossil fuels entirely is still a  revolutionary idea and many energy experts are skeptical.  However, more and more scientists, engineers and activists  actively promote a 100% renewable energy vision. According  to the IPCC’s latest assessment report, we have already used  almost 2/3 of our carbon budget, if we are to have a  reasonable chance of limiting global mean temperature rise to  2 degrees C. At the current and projected rate of  consumption, this entire budget will be used by 2040. So it is  essential that we move rapidly towards a new form of energy  supply – one that delivers 100% renewable energy by 2050.  Greenpeace and its renewable industry association partners  have been researching and presenting Energy [R]evolution  scenarios since 2005, and more recently has started  collaborating with the scientific community. While our  predictions on the potential and market growth of renewable  energy may have seemed fanciful or unrealistic, they have  9  proved to be accurate.1 The 2015 edition of the global Energy  [R]evolution features: 1) a 100% renewable energy scenario  for the first time; 2) a basic Energy [R]evolution case with a  final energy share of 83% renewables which follows the  pathway for the E[R] published in 2012; and 3) and the IEA´s  World Energy Outlook 2014 Current Policies scenario  extrapolated out to 2050- which serves as a reference case.  the transport [r]evolution has not really started yet  While the transition towards 100% renewables in the  “traditional” power and heating sector seems well within our  grasp, the phase-out of fossil fuels in the transport- and parts  of the industry sector are still present major challenges,  especially air travel and transport. Oil dominates the global  transport system and a switch from combustion engines to  electric drives is not possible for example for airplans.. The  “transport revolution” is not simply a technology change; it  requires new mobility concepts and the auto industry need to  change just like utilities, from selling a product – such as cars  – to selling mobility services. Increased shares of e-mobility will  increase the overall power demand significantly, adding more  pressure on utilities to provide more electricity while phasing  out coal and nuclear power plants. Electric mobility must go  hand in hand with renewable energy expansion, as an electric  car supplied by coal power plant would emit nearly as much if  not more CO2 than an efficient one with a combustion engine.  new fossil fuels – a high-risk investment  The Energy [R]evolution scenario provides a pathway to phaseout  the use of oil roughly at the pace of the depletion rates of  existing oil fields. However, while we grapple with meeting the  climate challenge, companies and governments are spending  billions to develop new oil production which we cannot use. The  financial community is waking up to the risks associated with not  only investments in new production which may become  ‘stranded assets’, but the risks to the value of the existing  reserves carried by fossil fuel companies (and governments, for  that matter). The bank of England2 and others have started to  assess the risk to the global economy from potentially wiping  trillions of dollars’ worth of ‘unburnable carbon’ assets off the  balance sheets of fossil fuel companies. viewed in this context,  environmentally and economically risky projects to develop new  oil and gas fields in the Arctic, or in deep waters off brazil and in  the Gulf of Mexico, are high stakes gambles risking not only our  future but the stability of the global economy as well.  While road and rail transport for people will move step by step  toward electric drives, heavy duty fright will replace oil with  synfuels, hydrogen or bio mass. Aviation and shipping will have  to rely on fuels for the foreseeable future – and these fuels  need to come from renewable energies as well. Due to strict  sustainability criteria for biomass, the Energy [R]evolution  scenario only uses a very limited amount which needs to be  used wisely. Thus bio mass will be used mainly for aviation,  shipping (in combination with fuel saving concepts like second  generation wind drives) and to provide industrial process heat.  education – the fuel of the future  A 100% renewable energy supply requires changes in all sectors  and it is not just a technology switch, but goes hand in hand with  development of new business concepts and policies which  support them. New, lighter and sustainable materials, and  software development for better integrated “system thinking”  requires continuous research and education. New electricity and  energy market designs at both the wholesale and retail level will  be required to send the right price signals. New jobs will be  created while others will disappear. Investment in universities and  Schools pays of better than investments in fossil fuel projects.  just transition – don´t leave the workers behind  Currently there are almost 10 million workers in the global coal  industry, and our calculations show that the solar photovoltaic  industry could employ the same number of workers in only 15  years from now. The wind industry could grow by a factor of 10  from the current 700,000 employees to over 7 million by 2030  – twice as many as in the global oil- and gas industry today.  However, this transition will have to be organized and training  programs are needed to educate new workers and maintain  social stability for energy workers as a whole. Even the 100%  Energy [R]evolution scenario still requires 2 million coal  workers in 2030 -there is a still a generation to organize the  shift so no-one is left behind. but the transition must start now.  barriers towards 100% renewables? the lack of  consistent climate and energy policies!  A shift towards 100% renewables is possible within one  generation. A baby born in 2015 can witness a fossil fuel free  world by the age of 35 – but climate and energy policies  globally need to pave the way away from climate chaos  towards a sustainable energy supply for all.  The upcoming uNfCCC climate conference in Paris needs to  deliver mandatory policies for all countries. This could  establish the basis of a truly sustainable energy future.    SOLAR POWER EuROPE  Energy [R]evolution scenarios have become a well-known  and respected energy analysis since first published in 2005.  In the third version of the Energy [R]evolution published in  june 2010 in berlin, we reached out to the scientific  community to a much larger extent. The IPCC´s Special  Report Renewables (SRREN) chose the Energy Revolution as  one of the four benchmark scenarios for climate mitigation  energy pathways, because it was the most ambitious  scenario: combining an uptake of renewable energy and  energy efficiency, it put forwards the highest renewable  energy share by 2050. following the publication of the  SRREN in May 2011 in Abu Dhabi, the ER became a widely  quoted energy scenario and is now part of many scientific  debates and referenced in numerous scientific peer-reviewed  publications.  In March 2015, the Energy [R]evolution received worldwide  recognition when a widely circulated report from the uS-based  Meister Consultants Group concluded that the rapid  market growth of renewable power generation has been  largely underestimated and reported that “just about no one  saw it coming. The world’s biggest energy agencies, financial  institutions, and fossil fuel companies, for the most part,  seriously underestimated just how fast the clean power  sector could and would grow”. Meister identifies one group  that got the market scenario closest to right, however, and it  wasn’t the International Energy Agency or Goldman Sachs or  the uS Department of Energy (DOE) – it was Greenpeace with  the Energy [R]evolution project.  The basic principles and strategic approach of the  development of the Energy [R]evolution concepts have not  significantly changed since the beginning. They still serve as  a basis for scenario modeling. However, the methodology  and underlying scientific research about transport  technologies and concepts, energy resource assessments,  infrastructural requirements, technology developments, and  the cost of renewables have been continuously updated and  improved. The renewable energy targets have been increased  from 50% to 80% and finally to 100% by 2050.  Since the first Energy [R]evolution was published a decade  ago, the energy sector has changed significantly. Renewable  energy technologies have become mainstream in most  countries as a consequence of dramatically reduced costs. A  future renewable energy supply is no longer science fiction,  but work in progress.  However, the growth rates of renewables – especially in the  heating sector and in transport – are far too slow to achieve the  energy-related CO2 reductions required to avoid dangerous  climate change. A fundamental shift in the way we consume  and generate energy must begin immediately and be well  10  e x e c u t i v e s u M M a r y  image adele island, off of australia’s north coast.

Here are some of the IEA’s conclusions:  costs: Increasingly, renewables are competitive with new  fossil fuel plants, and the cost gap between renewable  electricity and fossil power from new plants is closing  worldwide. Nonetheless, markets still do not reflect the true  environmental cost of power generation from fossil fuels.  policy: Power markets must be redesigned to accommodate  variable, distributed renewables. Obstacles still exist for the  financing of renewable energy projects and grid connections,  thereby slowing down the transition. but the worst policy  mistakes are uncertainty and retroactive changes.  technology: Cogeneration and renewable heat have both  grown in absolute terms but are not increasing quickly  enough as a share of energy supply. The share of  cogeneration in power supply has even stagnated. Likewise,  battery storage has mainly been developed for mobility up to  now but is increasingly used for frequency regulation to  integrate a greater share of variable renewables.  mobility: Electric vehicles are catching on, with an increasing  number of manufacturers now offering hybrid and electric  options. fuel efficiency standards have also made light  vehicles more efficient. The standard should now be applied  to larger trucks and buses.  buildings: The technologies are available, and targets are in  place in many regions. However, the rate and depth of  energy-efficient renovations needs to increase for true  progress to be made in this sector because the building stock  has a service life counted in decades.  The Renewable Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)  has undertaken a global renewable market analysis each year  in june since 2004. The publication – “Renewables – Global  Status Report” – is among the most comprehensive global and  national surveys of the renewable industry sector. According to  the latest edition, the global renewable energy market in 2014  was dominated by three power generation technologies: solar  photovoltaics (Pv), wind, and hydro. Combined, these  technologies added 127 GW of new power generation capacity  worldwide. by year’s end, renewables made up an estimated  60% of net additions to the global power capacity. In several  countries renewables represented a higher share of added  capacity (REN21-2015).3 The increase in market volume and  strong global competition led to significant cost reductions,  especially for solar Pv and wind power. As a result, other  renewable energy technologies were under pressure to lower  costs, particularly in the heating sector due to the increased  competitiveness of electricity-based heating systems. Cost-competitive  solar Pv in combination with electrical heat pumps  have become economically viable, negatively impacting the  solar thermal collector market.  underway before 2020 in order to avert the worst impacts of  climate change.1 We need to limit global warming to less than  2° Celsius, above which the impacts become devastating.  climate change is not a prediction anymore –  it is reality  The world’s energy supply has bestowed great benefits on  society, but it has also come with high price tag. The world’s  most rigorous scientific bodies are in agreement on climate  change, which is occurring due to a build-up of greenhouse  gases, especially carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere caused  by human activity.  Globally, most fossil fuel is used to generate energy, either  electricity, heat, or motor fuel. We have evidence that, if  unchanged, the growth of fossil energy will lead to  unmanageable impacts on the global population.  Climate change threatens all continents, living systems,  coastal cities, food systems and natural systems. It will mean  more natural disasters like fire and floods, disruption to food  growing patterns and damage to property as sea levels rise.  If we remain dependent on fossil fuel in the pursuit of energy  security, the result will be a potentially catastrophic spiral  towards increasing greenhouse gas emissions and more  extreme climate impacts. The need for more fuels is driving  the industry towards unconventional sources, like shale oil  and gas, and gigantic coal mines, which destroy ecosystems  and put water supply in danger. Relying on a fuel that has a  fluctuating cost on the global market is also harmful to  economies. The use of nuclear energy is sometimes touted  as a climate change solution, but it is simply not viable. Apart  from being too dangerous and too slow to develop, it is also  incredibly expensive if all economic costs over plant lifetime  are taken into account.  furthermore, by switching to unconventional sources, we  extract more carbon from the ground. yet, since the  International Energy Agency coined the term “un-burnable  carbon,” the consensus is that we must leave most (around  two thirds) of our current carbon resources in the ground if  the world is to stay within its carbon budget. The more  unconventional fuels we add to our resources, the less likely  staying within an increase of two degrees Celsius becomes.  According to the IPCC identified the remaining carbon  budget: humankind cannot emit more than 1,000 gigatonnes  of CO2 from now. Therefore it is essential to move rapidly  towards a decarbonized energy system – in ideal case one  that delivers 100% renewable energy by 2050.    While developments in the renewable energy, heating and  cooling sector were slower than in the power sector, the  markets for solar thermal collectors and geothermal heat  pumps grew by 9%. bio-heat production remained stable in  2014, increasing only 1% from 2013 levels. The lack of  infrastructure for heating systems and an uncertain policy  environment impeded the development of the renewable  energy renewable energy heating market (REN21-2015).  The number of electric vehicles worldwide doubled year over  year to 665,000. E-mobility and recent developments in  battery storage (including significant cost reductions) are  likely to change the future role of renewable energy in the  transport sector. biofuels, however, are still the main  renewable fuel source in the transport sector; they grew by  8.4% in 2014 compared the previous year (REN21-2015).  In conclusion, developments in the heating/cooling sector  and the transport sector in particular are far too slow. Despite  all the success in the renewable power sector, the extreme  growth of coal power generation, especially in China,  undercuts many successes with renewables. However, the  first sign of a stagnation of coal demand in China – even a  small decline for the first time in 2014 – provides reason to  hope. The political framework of energy markets must adapt  to the newly emerging, mostly distributed energy  technologies in order to support the transition to 100%  renewable energy supply.  Thus, Energy [R]evolution has begun, especially in the power  sector, but heating and transport significantly lag behind.  Overall, the transition from fossil and nuclear fuels to  renewables is too slow, and energy demand is still growing  too quickly.  less is more  using energy efficiently is cheaper than producing new  energy from scratch and often has many other benefits. An  efficient clothes washing machine or dishwasher, for  example, uses less power and saves water, too. Efficiency in  buildings doesn’t mean going without – it should provide a  higher level of comfort. for example, a well-insulated house  will feel warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer and be  healthier to live in. An efficient refrigerator is quieter, has no  frost inside or condensation outside, and will probably last  longer. Efficient lighting offers more light where you need it.  Efficiency is thus really better described as ‘more with less’.  the transport revolution must start in megacities  Sustainable transport is needed just as much as a shift to  renewable electricity and heat production in order to reduce  the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Today, just  over one fourth (27%) (IEA WEO SR 2015) of current energy  use comes from the transport sector, including road and rail,  aviation and sea transport. by the end of 2013, 92.7% of all  transport energy need came from oil products, 2.5% from  biofuels and only 1% from electricity (IEA WEO SR 2015). A  transition from fossil fuels to renewable electricity – either  directly or via synthetic fuels – for the entire global transport  sector is required in order to phase-out carbon emissions.  This is one of the most difficult parts of the Energy  [R]evolution and requires a true technical revolution. It is  ambitious but nevertheless possible with currently available  technologies for land-based and other transport.  14% of all fossil transport fuels are used for “bunker fuel,”  meaning transport energy for international shipping and  international air transport. In order to replace bunker fuels  entirely with renewables, a combination of energy efficiency  and renewable fuels is required. both the marine and aviation  sector can start this transition, but we need more research  and development along the way towards a truly 100%  renewable system. biofuels and synfuels – produced with  renewable electricity – are the only realistic renewable energy  option for planes currently and for the next decade. for  ships, new wind-based drives, such as new generation sails  and flettner rotors, are needed to replace some engine fuels.  The transport [R]evolution, however, must start in  (mega)cities, where a modular shift from individual to efficient  and convenient public transport systems powered by  renewable electricity is possible in a short time frame and  with currently available technologies. Political action is the  main barrier in changing land-based transport systems.  the global energy [r]evolution – key results  Renewable energy sources accounted for 12% the world´s  primary energy demand in 2012. The main sources of today  are biomass and hydro, which are mostly used for heating  and transport but increasingly in the power sector as well.  for electricity generation, renewables contribute about 21%,  just as for heat supply (21%). While solar photovoltaic and  wind revolutionize the power sector with increasing shares,  hydropower remains the largest renewable source. biomass  is the number one source for renewable heating. However,  geothermal heat pumps and solar thermal collectors  increasingly contribute as well. About 81.2% of the primary  energy supply today still comes from fossil fuels energy.  The two Energy [R]evolution scenarios describe development  pathways to a sustainable energy supply, achieving the  urgently needed CO2 reduction target and a nuclear phaseout,  without unconventional oil resources. The key results of  the global Energy [R]evolution scenarios are the following:  • use energy wisely: Combining the projections on population  development, GDP growth and energy intensity results in  future development pathways for the world’s final energy  demand. under the Reference scenario, total final energy  demand increases by 65% from the current 326,900 Pj/a  to 539,000 Pj/a in 2050. In the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario, final energy demand decreases by 12%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  289,000 Pj/a by 2050. The Advanced scenario will shift the  energy demand trends; the peak will be reached in 2020  with a total consumption of 355,000 Pj/a – 7% below the  Reference case - and remain at that level for about a  decade. Due to a faster electrification of the transport  sector including higher shares of public transport the  overall final energy demand drops below current levels  before 2040 and reaches 279,000 Pj/a by 2050 – 15%  below the current global demand.  • electricity replaces fuels: under both Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, due to economic growth, increasing living  standards and electrification of the transport sector, overall  electricity demand is expected to increase despite  efficiency gains in all sectors. Total electricity demand will  rise from about 18,860 TWh/a in 2012 to 37,000 TWh/a by  2050 in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario. Compared  to the Reference scenario, efficiency measures in the  industry, residential and service sectors avoid the  generation of about 16,700 TWh/a. This reduction can be  achieved in particular by introducing highly efficient  electronic devices using the best available technology in all  demand sectors.  The transformation to a carbon free 100% renewable  energy system in the Advanced Energy [R]evolution  scenario will further increase the electricity demand in 2050  up to more than 40,000 TWh/a. Electricity will become the  major renewable ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for  various purposes but also for the generation of synthetic  fuels for fossil fuels substitution. Around 8,100 TWh are  used in 2050 for electric vehicles and rail transport, around  5,100 TWh for hydrogen and 3,600 TWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  • reducing global heat demand: Efficiency gains in the  heating sector are even larger than in the electricity sector.  under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios, consumption  equivalent to about 76,000 Pj/a is avoided through  efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the Reference  scenario. As a result of energy-related renovation of the  existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction of  low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning  systems, enjoyment of even greater comfort and better  energy services will be accompanied with much lower  future energy demand.  • electricity generation: The development of the electricity  supply sector is characterised by a dynamically growing  renewable energy market and an increasing share of  renewable electricity. This trend will more than compensate  for the phasing out of nuclear power production in the  Energy [R]evolution scenarios, continuously reducing the  number of fossil fuel-fired power plants as well. by 2050,  92% of the electricity produced worldwide will come from  renewable energy sources in the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario. ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, Pv, CSP and  geothermal energy – will contribute 68% to the total  electricity generation. Already by 2020, the share of  renewable electricity production will be 31% and 58% by  2030. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about  7,800 GW in 2030 and 17,000 GW by 2050.  A 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources  in the Advanced scenario leads to around 23,600 GW  installed generation capacity in 2050. by 2020, wind and Pv  will become the main contributors to the growing market  share. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind and Pv will  be complemented by electricity from solar thermal,  geothermal and ocean energy. The Energy [R]evolution  scenarios will lead to a high share of flexible power  generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already 31% to  36% by 2030 and 53% to 55% by 2050. Therefore, smart  grids, demand side management (DSM), energy storage  capacities and other options need to be expanded in order  to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.  • future costs of electricity generation: The introduction of  renewable technologies under both Energy [R]evolution  scenarios slightly increases the future costs of electricity  generation compared to the Reference scenario by 2030.  However, this difference in full cost of generation will be  minor with around 0.2 uS$ cent/kWh in both the basic E[R]  and the 100% renewables Advanced scenario, however,  without taking into account potential integration costs for  storage or other load-balancing measures. Due to  increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  across all world regions starting in 2030 under the Energy  [R]evolution scenarios. In some countries such as China  and India, the Energy [R]evolution pathway – under the  assumption of global fuel price paths – is economical from  the very beginning and cheaper than conventional power  supply after 2020 already. by 2050, the average global  generation costs in the basic Energy [R]evolution will be 2.5  uS$ cent/kWh below the Reference case, while the  Advanced scenario achieves lower cost savings due to  higher capacity needs (1.7 uS$ cents/kWh below the  Reference case).  • the future electricity bill: under the Reference scenario, on  the other hand, growth in demand and increasing fossil fuel  prices result in total electricity supply costs rising from  today’s uS$ 2.06 trillion per year to more than uS$ 5.35  trillion in 2050, compared to 19% lower costs (uS$ 4.3  trillion) in the basic E[R] scenario due to increasing energy  efficiency and shifting energy supply to renewables.  The Advanced scenario with 100% renewable power  replaces more fossil fuels with electricity and therefore  leads to higher overall generation costs of uS$ 6.2 trillion  by 2050 but savings in fuel supply costs especially for the  transport and industry sector due to a fossil fuel phase-out.  both Energy [R]evolution scenarios not only comply with    world´s CO2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  • world: future investments in the power sector: Around uS$  48 trillion is required in investment for the Energy  [R]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately uS$ 1.23 trillion per year, about  50% more than in the Reference case (uS$ 24.5 trillion or  0.63 trillion per year). Investments for the Advanced  scenario add up to uS$ 64.6 trillion by 2050, on average  uS$ 1.66 trillion per year, including high investments in  additional power plants for the production of synthetic  fuels. under the Reference scenario, the level of investment  in conventional power plants adds up to almost 50%, while  the other half would be invested in renewable energy and  cogeneration by 2050.  under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios, however, around  95% of the entire investment in the power sector would  shift towards renewables and cogeneration. by 2030, the  fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be  focused mainly on gas power plants.  because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario reach a  total of uS$ 39 trillion by 2050, approximately uS$ 1 trillion  per year. The total fuel cost savings would therefore cover  170% of the total additional investments compared to the  Reference scenario. fuel cost savings in the Advanced  scenario are even higher and add up to uS$ 42 trillion, or  uS$ 1.1 trillion per year. Thus additional investment under  the Advanced scenario would be covered entirely (107%)  by fuel cost savings. Renewable energy sources would then  go on to produce electricity without any further fuel costs  beyond 2050, while costs for coal and gas would continue  to be a burden on national economies.  • world: energy supply for heating: Today, renewables meet  around 21% of the global energy demand for heating, the  main contribution coming from the use of biomass.  Dedicated support instruments are required to ensure a  dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. In Energy [R]evolution scenarios, renewables  provide 42% (basic) and 43% (advanced) of global heat  demand in 2030 and 86% / 94% in 2050 respectively.  ◦ Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 33 % in 2050  (relative to the Reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  ◦ In the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal  energy (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and  hydrogen from renewable sources are increasingly  substituting for fossil fuel-fired systems.  ◦ A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  CO2 emissions.  up to 2030, biomass remains the main contributor of the  growing market share. After 2030, the continuing growth of  solar collectors and a growing share of geothermal and  environmental heat as well as heat from renewable  hydrogen will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels.  The Advanced scenario results in a complete substitution of  the remaining gas consumption by hydrogen generated  from renewable electricity.  • world: future investments in the heating sector: In the  heating sector, the Energy [R]evolution scenarios also  require a major revision of current investment strategies in  heating technologies. In particular, far more solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need to be  installed if these potentials are to be tapped for the heating  sector. The use of biomass for heating purposes - often  traditional biomass today - will be substantially reduced in  the Energy [R]evolution scenarios and replaced by more  efficient and sustainable renewable heating technologies.  Renewable heating technologies are extremely variable,  from low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors  to very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar  arrays. Thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the  Energy [R]evolution scenario in total requires around uS$  16.3 trillion to be invested in renewable heating  technologies up to 2050 (including investments for  replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately uS$ 420 billion per year. The Advanced  scenario assumes an even more ambitious expansion of  renewable technologies resulting in an average investment  of around uS$ 429 billion per year, while the main strategy  in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural  gas amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.  • world: future employment in the energy sector – reference  versus advanced scenario: The Advanced Energy  [R]evolution scenario results in more energy sector jobs  globally at every stage of the projection.  ◦ There are 35.5 million energy sector jobs in the  Advanced Energy [R]evolution in 2020, and 29.6 million  in the Reference scenario.  ◦ In 2025, there are 45.2 million jobs in the Advanced  Energy [R]evolution scenario, and 29.1 million in the  Reference scenario.  ◦ In 2030, there are 46.1 million jobs in the Advanced  Energy [R]evolution scenario and 27.3 million in the  Reference scenario.  jobs in the coal sector decline in both the Reference scenario  and the Advanced scenario, as a result of productivity  improvements in the industry, coupled with a move away from  coal in the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario.    In the Reference scenario jobs increase slightly to 2020,  after which energy sector jobs decline. This is mainly driven  by losses in the coal sector. At 2030, jobs are 4% (2.3  million) below 2015 levels. In the Energy [R]evolution  scenario, strong growth in the renewable sector leads to an  increase of 25% in total energy sector jobs by 2020, and  job numbers are nearly 60% above 2015 levels in 2025.  job numbers continue to rise after 2025, to reach  46.1 million jobs by 2030.  Renewable energy accounts for 86% of energy jobs by  2030. Solar photovoltaics will provide 9.7 million jobs,  equal to the amount of coal jobs today. Employment in the  wind sector will increase by a factor of 10 from 0.7 million  today to over 7.8 million in 2030, twice as many jobs as the  current oil and gas industry.  • world: transport: A key target is to introduce incentives for  people to drive smaller cars and use new, more efficient  vehicle concepts. In addition, it is vital to shift transport use  to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in  the expanding large metropolitan areas. Along with rising  prices for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the further  growth in car sales projected under the Reference scenario.  Due to population increase, GDP growth and higher living  standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to increase in the Reference scenario by around  65% from 90,000 Pj/a in 2012 to 148,000 Pj/a in 2050. In  the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario, efficiency measures  and modal shifts will save 53% (78,700 Pj/a) in 2050  compared to the Reference scenario.  Additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to  even higher energy savings in the Advanced scenario of  62% (92,000 Pj/a) in 2050 compared to the Reference  scenario. Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid,  plug-in hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring  about large efficiency gains. by 2030, electricity will provide  9% of the transport sector’s total energy demand in the  Energy [R]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 39% in  the basic and 52% in the Advanced scenario. Hydrogen  and other synthetic fuels generated using renewable  electricity are complementary options to further increase  the renewable share in the transport sector. In 2050, up to  14,000 Pj/a of hydrogen is used in the transport sector for  the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario.  • world: development of CO2 emissions: While the world’s  emissions of CO2 will increase by 56% between 2012 and  2050 under the Reference scenario, under the basic Energy  [R]evolution scenario they will decrease from 30,470 million  tonnes in 2012 to 4,360 million tonnes in 2050. Annual per  capita emissions will drop from 4.3 tonne to 0.5 tonne. In  spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production and  increasing power demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in  the electricity sector. In the long run, efficiency gains and  the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles  strongly reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 31% share of CO2, the industry sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic E[R]  scenario. by 2050, global CO2 emissions are around 80%  below 1990 levels in the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario.  co2 emission peak by 2020: The 100% renewable energy  Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario will decarbonize the  entire energy system by 2050. under that pathway the  combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy  technologies will lead to a stabilization of global CO2  emissions by 2020 and a constant reduction towards near  zero emissions in 2050.  by 2030, global CO2 emissions would be back to 1990  levels. Only a decade later, a further 60% reduction is  achieved. The total carbon emission between 2012 and  2050 would add up to 667 Gt CO2 in the Advanced Energy  [R]evolution scenario and 744 Gt CO2 in the basic E[R]. In  comparison, the Reference would lead to 1,400 Gt CO2  between 2012 and 2050 – more than twice as much as  under the Advanced scenario bringing the world to a +4°C  pathway with disastrous consequences for the global flora  and fauna and life-threatening impacts for the humanity.  Switching to 100% renewable is therefore a matter of  survival.  • world: primary energy consumption: under the basic E[R]  scenario, primary energy demand will decrease by 19%  from today’s 534,870 Pj/a to around 433,000 Pj/a.  Compared to the Reference scenario, overall primary  energy demand will be reduced by 50% in 2050 under the  E[R] scenario (REf: around 860,000 Pj in 2050). The  Advanced scenario results in a slightly primary energy  consumption of around 450,000 Pj in 2050 due to  additional conversion losses for the production of  synthetic-fuels.  The Energy [R]evolution scenario aims to phase out coal  and oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expanding renewable energy and quickly rolling out very  efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace  oil-powered combustion engines. This leads to an overall  renewable final energy share of 42% in 2030 and 72% in  2040 in the Advanced E[R]. by 2050, 100% of all global  energy demand is covered with renewables. The only  remaining fossil fuels are assumed for non-energy uses,  such as petrochemical and steel products.  further research is needed  further research and development of innovative technologies  is a precondition of the Energy [R]evolution and the required  fundamental transformation of the energy systems. Thus, the  scenarios assume further improvements of performance and  costs of plants for electricity and heat generation from  renewables, new vehicle concepts and in an implicit way also  for other infrastructures such as electricity and heating grids,  charging infrastructure, synthetic fuel generation plants or    a sustainable world energy outlook  storages and other load balancing options. The spatial  resolution of the scenarios and their development pathways  is very coarse distinguishing ten different world regions.  Energy systems and aspects such as the refinancing of  investment in new capacities are largely determined by  specific local and regional conditions. Therefore, the Energy  [R]evolution needs more in-depth systems analysis and  assessment of alternative pathways and concepts under  different framework conditions such as potentials and cost-effectiveness  of renewable energy use. Infrastructural needs,  economic and societal aspects need to be considered at  least country-wise and by more sophisticated methods as it  was possible for this study. Such analyses are already done  or underway in several countries and regions. Other countries  and regions still need more scientific analysis of feasible ways  deploying their potentials for efficiency measures and  renewable energies and for implementing new technologies in  a cost-effective way. To fully understand the Energy  [R]evolution requires the use and further development of  existing sophisticated modelling approaches such as system  dynamics, agent-based modelling of actor’s behaviour or  dynamic modelling of capacity expansion and operation with  high spatial and temporal resolution.  policies required for a transition to 100% energy  [r]evolution:  To make the Energy [R]evolution a reality, immediate political  action is required. There are no economic or technical  barriers to move to 100% renewable energy in the long-term.  Governments regulate energy markets, both for supply and  demand; they can educate everyone from consumers to  industrialists and stimulate the markets for renewable energy  and energy efficiency by implementing a wide range of  economic mechanisms. They can also build on the successful  policies already adopted by other countries. To get started,  governments need to agree on further binding emission  reduction commitments under the uNfCCC process.  Meanwhile, the global emissions landscape is changing  rapidly. As a result of declining coal consumption in China,  global energy-related CO2 emissions remained stable in 2014  for the first time in 40 years, despite continued economic  growth. If global mitigation endeavours are strengthened, this  trend will continue. This new landscape provides a greater  chance that the coal, oil and nuclear industries – which  continue to fight to maintain their dominance by propagating  the outdated notion that citizens need their unsustainable  energy – will face dramatic changes in both energy markets  and support from governments.  an effective climate agreement should include strong short-term  action and set out a clear long-term pathway. key  elements include the following:  a strong long-term goal: phase-out of fossil fuels and nuclear  power by 2050 through a just transition towards 100% renewable  energy, as well as the protection and restoration of forests. A  clear signal to decision-makers and investors at all levels that  the world is moving towards phasing out carbon emissions  entirely and accelerating the transition to 100% renewable  energy is needed. Countries’ short-term emission reduction  commitments must align with this long-term goal and support  transformational change, ensuring both fairness and  solidarity.  a 5-year cycle process for country commitments starting in  2020. All countries’ commitments should follow a 5-year  commitment period starting in 2020, which would form the  first period of the Paris Protocol. Moving forward, each period  would further deepen the commitments, allowing no backsliding.  5-year commitment periods incentivize early action,  allow for dynamic political responses and prevent the lock-in  of low ambition. They allow for a timely adaptation to the  technological advances of renewable energies and energy  efficiency.  legally binding: A legally binding protocol - including common  accounting rules for mitigation and finance - will compel  leaders to act boldly; legally binding obligations are a real  expression of political will, ensuring durability in the face of  political changes and increased ambition over time.  shifting subsidies away from fossil fuels: All countries should  commit to phase-out all subsidies - both for production and  consumption - for fossil fuels by 2020.  strong commitment for adaptation, finance and loss and  damage: The Paris Protocol should acknowledge that less  mitigation action means a greater need for adaptation,  especially finance. Consequently, an adaptation goal should  be established to ensure that the level of support meets  vulnerable countries’ needs under the actual warming  anticipated. A roadmap must be adopted in Paris to meet the  uS$ 100 billion commitment for climate financing by 2020.  bring down emissions before 2020. The gap between the  agreed upon goal of keeping warming below 2°C/1.5°C and  what countries actually intend to do by 2020 is widely  acknowledged. The pledges at the time of this writing (mid-  2015) would lead us into a world of 3 or more degrees  warming, with all its devastating consequences for humans  and ecosystems. While a process on how to bring the  emissions down was established at COP17 in 2011,  countries are still – four years later – failing to agree upon  sufficient action to mitigate greenhouse gases. In Paris at the  latest, governments and corporate leaders need to provide  innovate solutions for breaking the stalemate and laying the  groundwork for bold actions before 2020.

The world’s  most rigorous scientific bodies are in agreement on climate  change, which is occurring due to a build of greenhouse  gases, especially carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere caused  by human activity.  Globally, most fossil fuel is used to generate energy, either  electricity, heat, or motor fuel. We have evidence that, if  unchanged, the growth of fossil energy will lead to  unmanageable impacts on the global population.  Climate change threatens all continents, living systems,  coastal cities, food systems and natural systems. It will mean  more natural disasters like fire and flood, disruption to food  growing patterns and damage to property as sea levels rise.  If we remain dependent on fossil fuel in the pursuit of energy  security, the result will be a potentially catastrophic spiral  towards increasing greenhouse gas emissions and more  extreme climate impacts. The need for more fuels is driving the  industry towards unconventional sources, like shale oil and gas,  and gigantic coal mines, which destroy ecosystems and put  water supply in danger. Relying on a fuel that has a fluctuating  cost on the global market is also harmful to economies.  furthermore, by switching to unconventional sources, we  extract more carbon from the ground. yet, since the  International Energy Agency coined the term “un-burnable  carbon,” the consensus is that we must leave most (around  two thirds) of our current carbon resources in the ground if  the world is to stay within its carbon budget. The more  unconventional fuels we add to our resources, the less likely  staying within an increase of two degrees Celsius becomes.  The use of nuclear energy as a climate change solution is  sometimes touted as a solution, but it is simply not viable.  Apart from being too dangerous and too slow to develop, it is  also incredibly expensive.  1.1 the impacts of climate change  Every day, we damage our climate by using fossil fuels (oil,  coal and gas) for energy and transport. The resulting changes  are likely to destroy the livelihoods of millions of people,  especially in the developing world, as well as ecosystems and  species, over the coming decades. Significantly reducing our  greenhouse gas emissions makes both environmental and  economic sense.  box 1.1 | what is the greenhouse effect?  The greenhouse effect is a natural process, in which the  atmosphere traps some of the sun’s energy, warming the  earth and moderating our climate. Increase in ‘greenhouse  gases’ from human activity has enhanced this effect,  artificially raising global temperatures and disrupting our  climate. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide -  produced by burning fossil fuels and through deforestation.  Others include methane from agriculture, animals and landfill  sites; nitrous oxide from agricultural production; and a variety  of industrial chemicals.  According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  the united Nations forum for established scientific opinion, the  world’s temperature is expected to increase over the next  hundred years by up to 4.8° Celsius if no action is taken to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions – much faster than anything  experienced so far in human history. At more than a 2°C rise,  damage to ecosystems and disruption of the climate system  increase dramatically. An average global warming of more  than 2°C threatens millions of people with an increased risk of  hunger, disease, flooding and water shortages.  A certain amount of climate change is now “locked in”, based  on the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  already emitted into the atmosphere since industrialisation.  No one knows exactly how much warming is “safe” for life on  the plant. However, we know is that the effects of climate  change are already impacting populations and ecosystems.  We can already see melting glaciers, disintegrating polar ice,  thawing permafrost, dying coral reefs, rising sea levels,  changing ecosystems, record droughts, and fatal heat waves  made more severe by a changed climate.  1.2 climate change – the science  En November 2014, the 5th Assessment Report of the  International Panel on climate change (IPCC) was published.  Over 5 years, several hundered climate scientists analysed the  latest scientific literature to pull together a comprehensive  overview about the latest finds of climate research. This  subchapter summarizes the key findings based on the Summary  for Policy Makers (SPM).    1.2.1 observed changes  first, the IPCC sees a clear human component in climate  change, with anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions  having reached an unprecedented level. The result will be  considerable detrimental impacts on “human and natural  systems” (IPCC-AR 5 SPM).1  There is no question that global warming is happening;  indeed, “since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are  unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere  and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have  diminished, and sea level has risen.” (IPCC-AR 5 SPM). The  global average temperature per decade at the earth’s surface  continues to increase, with 1983 to 2012 likely being “the  warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern  Hemisphere.” from 1880 to 2012, the planet has warmed up  by 0.85 degrees Celsius. (IPCC-AR5-SPM)  Global warming affects the planetary water cycle. Areas with  little precipitation have waters of higher salinity because more  water is lost through evaporation than precipitation. Globally,  these areas are indeed becoming more saline, whereas  waters have become fresher in areas of greater precipitation  since the 1950s – a clear sign that dry areas are becoming  drier while wet areas are getting wetter.  Likewise, the oceans have absorbed more CO2 since the  beginning of industrialization. As a result, ocean surface  water has become 26 percent more acidic, with the pH  having decreased by 0.1 (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  figure 1.1 | globaly averaged combined land  and ocean surface temperature anomaly    from 1992 to 2011, the world’s largest ice sheets – in  Greenland and the Antarctic – also shrank dramatically, and  glaciers are melting almost everywhere. Scientists are also  highly confident that temperatures in most permafrost regions  have increased since the early 1980s, partly due to changing  snow cover (IPCC-AR5-SPM). Likewise, Arctic sea ice shrank  by 3.5 to 4.1 percent per decade from 1979 to 2012. In  contrast, the extent of Antarctic sea ice increased by 1.2 to  1.8 percent per decade from 1979 to 2012 as more ice  slipped from the continent into the water (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  As more ice melts, sea level rises. According to the IPCC,  “Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by  0.19 m on average,” faster than at any time in the past 2000  years (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  1.2.2 causes of climate change  The atmosphere lets light pass through to the surface, where  objects absorb this energy, giving off heat radiation in the  process. The atmosphere then partially traps this heat. Since  the beginning of industrialization, anthropogenic greenhouse  gases (GHGs) have significantly increased concentrations of  carbon dioxide ( CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O),  to name the three most potent GHGs (IPCC-AR5-SPM). As a  result, Earth’s atmosphere is more effective at trapping heat.  Population growth is a major factor in carbon emissions from  fossil fuel consumption, but the impact of this growth  remained stable from 2000 to 2010 relative to the three  previous decades. In contrast, the impact of economic  growth has skyrocketed. In particular, greater coal  consumption has begun to make the global carbon intensity  of energy consumption higher once again after a brief period  of progress (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  Since the IPCC’s fourth Assessment Report, scientists have  collected even more evidence of man-made climate change.  In fact, scientists now estimate that anthropomorphic  impacts make up “more than half of the observed increase in  global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010”  (IPCC-AR5-SPM). All continents except Antarctica are  affected. Since 1960, anthropomorphic effects are likely to  have affected the global water cycle, including the melting of  glaciers and, since 1993, surface melting of the Greenland  ice sheet. Likewise, civilization’s emissions are very likely  contributors to Arctic sea ice loss since 1979 and the global  mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s.  1.2.3 impacts of climate change  Natural and human systems are sensitive to climate change,  and impacts have been observed on all continents and in  oceans (IPCC-AR5-SPM). Along with melting snow and ice,  changes in precipitation are affecting both the quantity and  quality of water resources. On land and in both fresh and  saltwater, numerous species – plant and animal – have seen  the location of their habitats shift, as have migration patterns.  Seasonal activities are also changing, and species are  interacting differently in response to climate change. Ocean  acidification also affects marine life.  you don’t need to be a scientist to measure the changes.  Humans are also witnessing the effects directly, with  numerous studies showing that a wide range of crops in a  large number of regions now produce smaller harvests (IPCCAR5-  SPM). The Inuit can feel the permafrost soften under  their feet, leading built structures to collapse. Pacific  Islanders have seen their freshwater supplies contaminated  with saltwater and coastlines inundated as sea level rises.  Numerous countries around the world increasingly experience  extreme floods and droughts. The IPCC itself admits that “not  all regional effects of climate change are known,” but all of  these trends were predicted. If current predictions for the  future hold true, as is likely, the future looks bleak.  Sea level will continue to rise as glaciers melt, bringing  landlocked ice into the oceans. In addition, the oceans  themselves will thermally expand as the global temperature rises.  There will also be positive feedback – changes that amplify  the trend. for instance, melting permafrost will release  massive amounts of greenhouse gases. Less snow and ice  cover will mean that more heat is absorbed by darker  surfaces. furthermore, numerous natural systems – coral  reefs, mangroves, Arctic and Alpine ecosystems, boreal and  tropical forests, prairie wetlands, and grasslands – will  struggle to survive as the climate changes; if these natural  systems shrink, they will not be able to trap as much carbon  dioxide. Another result will be a greater risk of species  extinction and lower biodiversity.  In Europe, rivers will increasingly flood, and the risk of floods,  erosion, and wetland loss will increase in coastal areas  everywhere. Industrialized countries have emitted the most  GHGs, but developing countries – the ones least able to  adapt to climate change – will be impacted the most. The  areas hit the hardest include large parts of Africa, Asia, and  the Pacific rim.  The long-term effects of global warming will be catastrophic.  The Greenland ice sheet could melt completely, thereby  eventually raising sea level up to seven meters. There is also  new evidence that Antarctic ice is now at the risk of melting  based on increased rates of ice discharge. As this freshwater  enters the ocean, the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic could slow  down or stop completely. The result would be a much  different climate for Europe, which depends on the Gulf  Stream to bring up warm air from the South. furthermore, the  Golf Stream is part of a global system of ocean currents,  which could also be disrupted, leading to unexpected shifts  in climates around the globe. As the IPCC puts it, “Never  before has humanity been forced to grapple with such an  immense environmental crisis.”    figure 1.5 | widespread impacts attributed to climate change  based on the available scientific literature since the ar4  note The latest scientific research finds “substantially more impacts in recent decades now attributed to climate change.” Note that the chart above shows only those impacts for which causality  has been demonstrated for climate change. Other impacts may be linked to global warming in the future, so the list could grow. source IPCC-AR5-SPM.    1  1.2.4 extreme events  Since 1950, some of the changes in extreme weather and  climate events have been linked to human influences.  Extremely cold temperatures have decreased, while  extremely high temperatures have become more frequent.  There is also been a noted increase in heavy precipitation in  various reasons. Heat waves have become more common in  Europe, Asia, and Australia. The impacts of heat waves,  droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires have revealed the  “significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems  and many human systems to current climate variability”  (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  If civilization continues to emit greenhouse gases, further  warming is highly likely, with long-term, irreversible, and severe  impacts on the entire climate. To prevent this calamity,  greenhouse gas emissions need to be substantially reduced.  Even then, significant resources will need to be devoted to future  climate adaptation from current emissions (IPCC-AR5-SPM).  1.3 nuclear threats  Nuclear energy is a relatively minor industry with major  problems. Currently covering just 2.3 per cent of the world’s  final energy consumption, nuclear’s share is set to decline  over the coming decades.  The amount of nuclear capacity added during last 15 years  (2000-2014: 20,000 MW) (WNISR 2015)2 was 17 times less  than the new wind capacity built in the same period (356,000  MW) (REN21-2015).3 Those new wind generators have a  potential annual generation of 900 TWh – equal to 120  nuclear reactors with a capacity of 1000MW each.  Despite the rhetoric of a ‘nuclear renaissance’ – a term the  nuclear industry has used since around 2001, the industry is  struggling with massive cost increases, construction delays  and safety and security problems. japan’s major nuclear  accident at fukushima following a tsunami came 25 years  after the disastrous explosion in the Chernobyl nuclear power  plant in the former Soviet union, showing that nuclear energy  is an inherently unsafe source of power. As a result, Siemens  declared its exit from the nuclear power sector in 2011 and  now only focuses on the delivery of spare parts for the existing  reactors along with operation and maintenance service.  following the fukushima accident, the German Parliament  resolved to shut all nuclear power plants by 2022,4 including  immediate the immediate closure of nearly half of them. That  same year, Germany also passed a set of laws to further  boost renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.  In the wake of the fukushima accident, 95% of Italians also  voted in a plebiscite to reject nuclear energy. At the start of  2012, over 90% of the japan’s reactors were offline. There  have been no significant problems with the electricity supply  with only 3 of 54 in operation.    1.3.1 no solution to climate protection  The nuclear industry promises that nuclear energy can  contribute to both climate protection and energy security;  however, their claims need to be reality-checked.  The most recent World Energy Outlook 2015 and the Special  Energy and Climate Report published by the International  Energy Agency,5 includes a bridge scenario for a future  energy mix to keep global carbon concentration below  450ppm. While renewables and energy efficiency play the  largest role to achieve this target, a large expansion of  nuclear power up to 2030 is still included. The technical  assumption is that the installed capacity will be increased  from 392 GW in 2013 up to 552 GW in 2030 – an additional  150 GW. To reach this goal, 10 GW – 7 to 10 nuclear reactors  – need to come on line every year, an extremely unlikely given  the “performance” of the nuclear industry. This pathway  would be very expensive and hazardous, while hardly helping  to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. A more realistic  analysis shows:  • The IEA scenario assumes investment costs of  uS$ 4,800/kWe installed, in line with what the industry has  been promising. The reality indicates costs of new plant are  three to four times higher (see box).  • Massive expansion of nuclear energy comes with an  increase in related hazards: the risk of serious reactor  accidents like in fukushima, japan; the growing stockpiles  of deadly high level radioactive waste which will need to be  safeguarded for hundreds of thousands of years; and  potential proliferation of both nuclear technologies and  materials through diversion to military or terrorist use.  • Climate science says that we need to reach a peak of  global greenhouse gas emissions before 2020. Even if the  world’s governments decided on strong nuclear expansion  now, not a single new reactor would start generating  electricity before 2020 because it typically takes at least ten  years from decision to commissioning. Any significant  contribution from nuclear power towards reducing  emissions would come too late to help save the climate.  1.3.2 the dangers of nuclear power  Electricity from nuclear power does produce less carbon  dioxide than fossil fuels, but nuclear power poses multiple  threats to people and the environment during operation. The  main risks are for safety of the reaction, nuclear waste  disposal and nuclear proliferation. These three risks are  detailed below and are the reasons nuclear power has been  discounted as a future technology in the Energy [R]evolution  Scenario.  safety risks  Several hundred accidents have occurred in the nuclear  energy industry since it began, including Windscale (1957),  Three Mile Island (1979), Chernobyl (1986), Tokaimura (1999)  and fukushima (2011). Despite the nuclear industry’s  assurances that a nuclear accident of the Chernobyl scale  could never happen again, an earthquake and subsequent  tsunami in japan caused leaks and explosions in four  reactors at the Daiichi nuclear power plant. Large areas  around the plant have been seriously contaminated with  radioactivity from the plant. Areas up to 50 km from the  facility have been evacuated, and food and water restrictions  apply at distances exceeding 100 km. The impacts on the  lives of hundreds of thousands of people and on the  japanese economy will be felt for decades to come. The  fukushima disaster proves the inherent safety problems with  nuclear energy.  • All existing nuclear reactors need continuous power to cool  the reactors and the spent nuclear fuel, even after the  reactor has shut down. In 2006, the emergency power  systems failed at the Swedish forsmark plant for 20  minutes during a power outage, and four of Sweden’s ten  nuclear power stations had to be shut down. If power had  not been restored, there could have been a major incident  within hours.  • A nuclear chain reaction must be kept under control, and  harmful radiation must, as far as possible, be contained  within the reactor, with radioactive products isolated from  humans and carefully managed. Nuclear reactions generate  high temperatures, and fluids used for cooling are often  kept under pressure. Together with the intense radioactivity,  these high temperatures and pressures make operating a  reactor difficult and complex.  • The risks from operating reactors are increasing, and the  likelihood of an accident is now higher than ever. Most of  the world’s reactors are more than 25 years old and  therefore more prone to age-related failures. Many utilities  are attempting to extend the life of their reactors, which  were designed to last only 30 years, up to 60 years, which  poses new risks.    • A series of institutional failures set the stage for the  fukushima Daiichi disaster including a system of industry-led  self-regulation, the industry’s overconfidence, its  inherently dismissive attitude towards nuclear risks, and its  neglect of scientific evidence. Institutional failures are the  main cause of all past nuclear accidents, but the nuclear  industry’s risk assessments fail to take those into account.  • Nuclear utilities are reducing safety-related investments  and have limited staff numbers, but they are increasing  reactor pressure and operational temperature and the burnup  of the fuel. This accelerates ageing and decreases  safety margins.  nuclear waste  Despite 50 years radioactive waste, there is no solution for  the long-term storage and safeguarding of these dangerous  materials. Disposal sites of low-level radioactive waste have  already started leaking after only decades, even though  highly radioactive waste needs to be safely contained for  hundreds of thousands of years. The nuclear industry claims  it can ‘dispose’ of its nuclear waste by burying it deep  underground, but this approach will not isolate the  radioactive material from the environment forever. A deep  dump only slows down the release of radioactivity into the  environment. Power plant developers try to predict how fast  a dump will leak so that it can claim that radiation doses to  the public living nearby in the future will be “acceptably low”.  but scientific understanding is not sufficiently advanced to  make such predictions with any certainty.  As part of a campaign to build new nuclear stations around  the world, the industry claims that public acceptability, not  technical obstacles, is the main problem that burying  radioactive waste faces. It cites nuclear dumping proposals in  finland and Sweden but without scientific backing for its  claims of safe disposal.  The most hazardous waste is the spent fuel removed from  nuclear reactors, which stays radioactive for hundreds of  thousands of years. In some countries, the situation is  exacerbated by ‘reprocessing’ this spent fuel, which involves  dissolving it in nitric acid to separate out weapons-usable  plutonium. This process leaves behind a highly radioactive  liquid waste. There are about 270,000 tonnes of spent  nuclear waste fuel in storage, much of it at reactor sites.  Spent fuel is accumulating at around 12,000 tonnes per year,  with around a quarter of that used for reprocessing.6  The least damaging option for waste already in existence is to  store it above ground, in dry storage at the site of origin.  However, this option also presents major challenges and  threats, as was seen in the fukushima accident where there  was major disruption to the cooling of the spent nuclear fuel.  The only real solution is to stop producing the waste.  nuclear proliferation  Manufacturing a nuclear bomb requires fissile material - either  uranium-235 or plutonium-239. Most nuclear reactors use  uranium as a fuel and produce plutonium during operation. It  is impossible to adequately prevent the diversion of  plutonium to nuclear weapons. A small-scale plutonium  separation plant can be built in four to six months, so any  country with an ordinary reactor can produce nuclear  weapons relatively quickly.  As a result, nuclear power and nuclear weapons have grown  up like Siamese twins. Since international controls on nuclear  proliferation began, Israel, India, Pakistan and North korea  have all obtained nuclear weapons; aside from Israel and  North korea, all of these countries also have nuclear power  plants. The tasks of International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) and the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) are  inherently contradictory: to promote the development of  ‘peaceful’ nuclear power whilst at the same time trying to  stop the spread of nuclear weapons.  Israel, India and Pakistan all used their civil nuclear  operations to develop weapons capability, operating outside  international safeguards. North korea developed a nuclear  weapon even as a signatory of the NPT. A major challenge to  nuclear proliferation controls has been the spread of uranium  enrichment technology to Iran, Libya and North korea. The  former Director General of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, Mohamed Elbaradei, has said that “should a state  with a fully developed fuel-cycle capability decide, for  whatever reason, to break away from its non-proliferation  commitments, most experts believe it could produce a  nuclear weapon within a matter of months”.7  The united Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change has also warned that the security threat of trying to  tackle climate change with a global fast-breeder programme  (using plutonium fuel) “would be colossal”.8 All of the reactor  designs currently being promoted around the world could be  fuelled partly with MOx (mixed oxide fuel), from which  plutonium can be easily separated.  Restricting the production of fissile material to a few ‘trusted’  countries will not work. Instead, it would create greater  security threats through inequity and resentment. A new uN  agency is needed to tackle the twin threats of climate change  and nuclear proliferation by phasing out nuclear power and  promoting sustainable energy, which would promote world  peace rather than threaten it.

There are no economic or technical  barriers to move to 100% renewable energy. Governments  regulate energy markets, both for supply and demand; they  can educate everyone from consumers to industrialists and  stimulate the market for renewable energy and energy  efficiency by implementing a wide range of economic  mechanisms. They can also build on the successful policies  already adopted by other countries. To get started,  governments need to agree on further binding emission  reduction commitments under the uNfCCC process.  2.1 international climate policy - the unfccc  and the kyoto protocol  Recognising the global threats of climate change, the  signatories to the 1992 uN framework Convention on  Climate Change (uNfCCC) followed up with the kyoto  Protocol in 1997. It entered into force in early 2005, and its  193 members meet continuously to negotiate further  refinement and development of the agreement. Only one  major industrialised nation, the united States, has not ratified  the protocol. In 2011, Canada announced its intention to  withdraw from the Protocol.  In Copenhagen in 2009, the 195 members of the uNfCCC  were supposed to deliver a new climate change agreement  towards ambitious and fair emission reductions.  unfortunately, they failed at this conference.  At the 2012 Conference of the Parties in Durban, there was  agreement to reach a new agreement by 2015 and adopt a  second commitment period at the end of 2012.  During the 2014 conference in Lima, the uS and other  developed countries emphasised the need to be “realistic”  and “nationally determined” with future emission cuts, and  resisted stronger action on finance and adaptation, in  particular for the most vulnerable countries. India and China,  on the other hand, allied with oil-producing states in an effort  to protect themselves from taking on tougher and more  binding emissions cuts in the future. The result was a messy  compromise that sets no common time frame for future  pollution cuts. While the Lima decision does require countries  to submit basic information about the climate actions they  plan to include in the next conference agreement (Paris -  COP21 in 2015), it also downgrades the proposed  assessment of the fairness and adequacy of countries’  contributions partly as a result of pressure from China and  India. Instead, the secretariat is to compile a mere technical  paper assessing the aggregate effect of the targets.  The outcome in Lima established no clear requirement for  rich countries to include climate finance in their reported  actions before Paris, nor does it establish a clear road-map  for scaling up finance towards the 100 billion dollars a year  promised by 2020. However, over time it does put adaptation  on a more equal footing with emission reductions.  In December 2015, the global community will meet in Paris  for the 21st uN Conference of the Parties (COP21) to  negotiate and sign a new global agreement to address  dangerous global warming. The success of the Paris COP  hinges upon countries agreeing to support a vision for 100%  clean renewable energy by 2050 and increased forest  protection. The formal negotiating text was released in March  2015 and further negotiated in bonn from 1-11 june 2015.  Meanwhile, the global emissions landscape is changing  rapidly. As a result of declining coal consumption in China,  global energy-related CO2 emissions remained stable in 2014  for the first time in 40 years, despite continued economic  growth. If global mitigation endeavours are strengthened, this  trend is set to continue. This new landscape provides a  greater chance that the coal, oil and nuclear industries –  which continue to fight to maintain their dominance by  propagating the outdated notion that citizens need their dirty  energy – will face dramatic changes in both energy markets  and support from governments.  countries´ commitments Countries’ national commitments  (also known as intended nationally determined contributions -  INDCs) are key components of the Paris agreement as they  are the tools for immediate and drastic emissions cuts.  Parties were asked to submit their proposed mitigation  commitments well in advance of the Paris conference. Thus  far, several major emitters, including China, have already  presented their plans. It is crucial that the remaining countries  submit as soon as possible.  international climate policy - looking ahead Countries should  not only present their short-term commitments, based on  5-year periods, but also outline long-term plans for a just  transition to an economy built on 100% clean renewable  energy. Countries should include other policy commitments in  their INDCs, such as renewable energy and energy efficiency  targets along with commitments to stop fossil fuel subsidies.  Rich countries and other countries in a position to do so  should also address the question of climate finance in their  commitments to ensure predictability and adequacy for  vulnerable countries.  an effective climate agreement should include strong short-term  action and set out a clear long-term pathway. key  elements include the following:  • a strong long-term goal: Phase-out of fossil fuels and nuclear  power by 2050 through a just transition towards 100%  renewable energy, as well as the protection and restoration of  forests. A clear signal to decision-makers and investors at  all levels that the world is moving towards phasing out  carbon emissions entirely and accelerating the transition to  100% renewable energy is needed. Countries’ short-term  emission reduction commitments must align with this longterm  goal and support transformational change, ensuring  both fairness and solidarity.    • a 5-year cycle process for country commitments starting 2020  All countries’ commitments should follow a 5-year  commitment period starting in 2020, which would form the  first period of the Paris Protocol. Moving forward, each  period would further deepen the commitments, allowing no  back-sliding. 5-year commitment periods incentivize early  action, allow for dynamic political responses and avoid  locking in low levels of ambition. They allow for a timely  adaptation to the technological advances of renewable  energies and energy efficiency.  • legally binding: A legally binding protocol - including  common accounting rules for mitigation and finance - will  compel leaders to act in a strong way; legally binding  obligations are the real expressions of political will,  ensuring durability in the face of political changes and  increased ambition over time.  • shifting subsidies away from fossil fuels. All countries should  commit to phase-out all subsidies- both production and  consumption - for fossil fuels until 2020 subsidies.  • strong commitment for adaptation, finance and loss and  damage: The Paris Protocol should acknowledge that less  mitigation action means a greater need for adaptation,  especially finance. Consequently, an adaptation goal  should be established to ensure that the level of support  meets vulnerable countries’ needs under the actual  warming anticipated. A roadmap must be decided in Paris  for how to meet the 100bn uSD commitment for climate  financing by 2020.  • bring down emissions before 2020. The gap between the  agreed upon goal of keeping warming below 2°C/1.5°C  and what countries actually intend to do by 2020 is widely  acknowledged. The pledges during time of writing of this  report (mid-2015) would lead us into a world of 3 or more  degrees warming, with all its devastating consequences for  humans and ecosystems. While a process on how to bring  the emissions down was established at COP17 in 2011,  countries are still – four years later – failing to agree upon  sufficient action to mitigate greenhouse gases. In Paris at  the latest, governments and corporate leaders need to  provide innovate solutions for breaking the stalemate and  laying the groundwork for bold actions before 2020.  2.1.1 international energy policy - energy policy  and market regulation  On many energy markets, renewable energy generators  currently compete with old nuclear and fossil fuel power  stations on an uneven playing field. Consumers and  taxpayers have already paid the interest and depreciation on  the original investments, so the generators are running at a  marginal cost. Political action is needed to overcome market  distortions so renewable energy technologies can compete  on their own merits.  While governments around the world are liberalising their  electricity markets, the increasing competitiveness of  renewable energy should lead to higher demand. Without  political support, however, renewable energy remains at a  disadvantage, marginalised after decades of massive financial,  political and structural support for conventional technologies.  Developing renewables will therefore require strong political  and economic efforts, for example through laws that guarantee  stable payment for up to 20 years. Renewable energy will also  contribute to sustainable economic growth, high quality jobs,  technology development, global competitiveness, and  industrial and research leadership.  2.2 renewable energy policies  In 2014, the global market trended towards increased levels of  renewable energy, with variable generation from wind and solar  leading the way. More electricity was used as a result, replacing  fuels both for heating and transport and changing energy  markets significantly, particularly in developed countries.  Global subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power remain high  despite reform efforts. Creating a level playing field can lead to  a more efficient allocation of financial resources, helping to  strengthen initiatives for the development and implementation  of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  Removing fossil-fuel and nuclear subsidies globally would  more accurately reflect the true cost of energy generation.  Cost competitiveness per unit no longer remains a barrier;  however, grid-connected renewable energy power plants and  the secure transport and delivery of electricity represent an  increased investment risk because it leads to uncertainty for  overall electricity sales from RE plants. In 2014, there was a  growing trend to link several policies together (such as  renewable energy targets, feed-in tariffs or tendering, and  grid access). The movement towards 100% renewable energy  targets for regions, islands, large cities and whole countries  continued to grow over the course of 2014. The following  section about the status of renewable energy policies by the  end of 2014 is based on an analysis published by the  Renewable Energy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)  (REN21 – 2015).  2.2.1 status of renewable energy policies  for electricity  Targets and supporting policy tools to promote renewable  energy for power generation continued to receive the majority  of attention from policymakers, outpacing those set for the  heating, cooling, and transportation sectors.  • targets have been identified in 164 countries as of early  2015 and were added or revised in 11 countries in 2014.  • feed-in tariffs (fITs) have now been enacted in 108  jurisdictions at the national or state/provincial level. Egypt  was the only country adding a new national fIT in 2014, but  a number of existing policies were amended with changes  varying by region, continuing the trend in recent years.  Countries including bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy,  japan, Russia, Switzerland, and the Philippines reduced  rates, while rates were increased and/or eligibility was  expanded in Algeria, Denmark, Malaysia, Poland, and  vietnam. China enacted a slate of revisions, simultaneously  opening fITs to new technologies and reducing rates for  some previously covered technologies.  • tendering both technology-neutral and technology-specific  tendering continues to be adopted by a growing number of  countries, with 60 countries having utilized renewable  energy tenders as of early 2015. The European  Commission issued guidelines to begin a continent-wide  shift away from fITs towards tenders. Poland indicated its  intention to phase out its green certificate scheme in favor  of tenders.  • new net-metering policies were added in three countries, all  in Latin America.  • renewable Portfolio standards (rPs) policies continue to face  opposition in a number of uS States. In 2014, Ohio became  the first state to freeze its RPS, and in 2015 West virginia  became the first state to remove its (voluntary) RPS entirely.  An estimated 126 countries had adopted some form of  financial support policy to promote renewable energy  technologies by early 2015.  • barriers to renewable energy: Charges or fees on renewable  energy have been introduced in an increasing number of  countries. In Europe, Germany, Austria and Italy enacted  new charges on self-consumed solar Pv, joining fellow Eu  member states including the Czech Republic, Greece, and  Spain with fees and/or taxes on renewable energy output.  2.2.2 status of renewable energy policies for  heating and cooling  Policies for renewable heating and cooling are slowly gaining  more attention from national policymakers. An estimated 45  countries worldwide had targets for renewable heating or  cooling in place by early 2015. In Europe, the majority of  targets in Eu and Energy Community Member States have  been introduced through each country’s National Renewable  Energy Action Plan (NREAP), while other countries have  adopted technology specific targets focused on specified  capacity or new installations of renewable heating systems.  • solar-specific renewable heat mandates were in place in 12  countries at the national or state/provincial level, and  technology-neutral mandates were in place in an additional  9 countries by early 2015. South Africa was the only  country to institute a new mandate during 2014.  • financial incentives continued to be the most widely enacted  form of policy support for renewable heating and cooling  systems in 2014. Algeria, Chile, Romania, and Slovenia all  re-introduced incentive schemes that had expired in  previous years, the Czech Republic, India, and kenya  strengthened existing schemes, and the uS states of  Minnesota and New york established new rebate programs  in 2014.  2.2.3 renewable energy transport policies  The majority of transport-related policies continued to focus  on developments in the biofuel sector and road transport;  however, other modes of transportation are attracting  attention as well. Policies promoting the linkage between  electric vehicles and renewable energy have received little  attention to date.  The debate over the sustainability of first-generation biofuels  continued worldwide in 2014, with European energy minsters  agreeing to a 7% cap on the contribution of first-generation  biofuel to meet the Eu-wide 10% renewable transport fuel  target. Italy became the first country in Europe to enact a  mandate promoting a specific share (0.6% by 2018) of  second-generation biofuels.  biofuel blend mandates are now in place in 34 countries, with  32 national mandates and 26 state/provincial mandates.  Within these policy frameworks, 45 jurisdictions now  mandate specified shares of bioethanol, and 27 mandate  biodiesel blends, with many countries enacting both.  Argentina, brazil, Malaysia, Panama, vietnam, and the uS  state of Minnesota all strengthened existing blend mandates  in 2014.  2.2.4 city and local government renewable energy  policies  Cities continue to set and reach ambitious targets for  renewable energy use which are also influenced by regions  and countries with 100% renewable energy targets. joining a  growing global movement of cities, new 100% targets were  set in fukushima (japan) and Maui County, Hawaii (uSA).  burlington, vermont (uSA), reached its 100% renewable  electricity goal in 2014.  Municipal policymakers in countries including brazil, China,  India, and the united Arab Emirates continued a growing  trend of utilizing municipal oversight of build code regulations    to mandate the deployment of renewable power generation  and renewable heat technologies.  Public-private partnerships and community power systems are  increasingly being utilized to increase renewable energy at the  local level. In the united States, over 2,000 communities have  already created community power systems. An additional 800  have created electricity co-operatives to increase local control  over power generation, while the CO-POWER project was  inaugurated in Europe to support community power  development across 12 European countries.  District heating and cooling systems have emerged as an  important measure, helping to facilitate the scale-up of  renewable energy, with Dubai (uAE) and Paris (france)  leading in 2014. In Europe, primarily in northern countries  such as Denmark, large-scale solar thermal heating plants  are increasingly being developed for connections to district  heat networks.  Municipal policymakers continued to use their purchasing  authority to support renewable energy in their cities. Cities  such as Paris (france) and San francisco (uSA) purchased  electric and biofuel vehicles for city fleets, including buses  used in public transportation systems.  2.2.5 distributed renewable energy in developing  countries  More than one billion people or 15% of the global population  still lack access to a power grid. With a total installed  capacity of roughly 147 GW, all of Africa has less power  generation capacity than Germany. Moreover, approximately  2.9 billion people lack access to cleaner forms of cooking.  Energy companies invested about uSD 63.9 billion in off-grid  solar Pv in 2014. bank of America (uSA) pledged uSD 1  billion to help finance distributed renewable energy projects  that normally would not pass risk assessments. It also agreed  to seed a Catalytic finance Initiative to stimulate at least uSD  10 billion of new investment in high-impact clean energy  projects. The aim is for such initiatives to help develop  innovative financing mechanisms, reduce investment risk and  attract a broader range of institutional investors to the sector.  There were new initiatives related to clean cooking during  2014. In july, Ecuador started executing a plan to introduce  3 million solar induction cooktops by 2016. Guatemala  established a Cluster of Improved Cook Stoves and Clean  fuels, representing individuals and organizations who work in  these two areas. bangladesh announced a Country Action  Plan for Clean Cook Stoves. India launched the unnat Chulha  Abhiyan Programme to develop and deploy 2.75 million clean  stoves by 2017. Several African countries, including Nigeria  and Senegal, also have programs to distribute millions of  clean cook stoves.  Some 30 transnational programs and 20 global networks  support national distributed renewable energy programs. The  Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (SE4ALL), Power Africa  program, the Energizing Development Program, the Global  Alliance for Clean Cook Stoves, and the Global Lighting and  Energy Access Partnership are playing a key role in further  distribution of distributed renewable energy, especially in  least developed countries.  In addition to existing, well established technologies such as  solar home systems and micro hydro dams, 2014 witnessed  the evolution of new types of equipment, configurations, and  applications. Thermoelectric generator (TEG) stoves utilize  their own heat to produce power that operates the blower or  fan, eliminating the need for an external source of electricity  and increasing the efficiency of combustion. flexi-biogas  systems use balloon (or tube) digesters made from a  polyethylene or plastic bag, making them mobile and  extremely lightweight. Pico-wind turbines offer a very lowcost  technology for powering remote telecommunications.  Solar-powered irrigation kits enable farmers to grow highvalue  fruits and vegetables.  Ancillary services and monitoring are making use of  digitization, and the “internet of things” facilitates improved  after-sales, better customer service, and lower costs, enabling  companies to reach more customers. Solar direct current (DC)  micro-grids offer superior compatibility with certain electric  appliances and can eliminate the need for an inverter.  bundling of products and services together into hybridized or  integrated packaged systems— especially bundles that  promote electricity and appliance usage, telecommunications,  and/or cooking—are a high-impact innovation.  2.2.6 energy efficiency: renewable energy’s  twin pillar  Success stories for energy efficiency standards Efficiency  standards proved very successful in 2014. building standards  and the construction of passive houses were implemented,  as were standards for electrical appliances in several  developing and emerging economies. The focus has been on  efficiency improvements in road transport, including fuel  economy improvements in private vehicles, increased  penetration of electric (Ev) and hybrid (HEv) vehicles, and  shifts to more sustainable modes of travel.  In 2013, more than 150 cities around the world had  implemented some kind of building efficiency standard. by  2014, 81 countries had introduced energy standards and  labeling programs, as well as mandatory energy performance  standards covering 55 product types, with refrigerators, room  air conditioners, lighting, and televisions being the most  commonly regulated.  by the end of 2013, standards for electric motors used in  industrial applications had been introduced in 44 countries,  including brazil, China, South korea, and the united States.  As of late 2014, vehicle fuel economy standards covered 70%  of the world’s light-duty vehicle market.    2.3 policy recommendations  Countries around the world are at varying levels of  development with RE. While some are just starting to deploy  modern RE - beyond traditional biomass and hydro – others  have already reached high penetration levels, particular for  solar and wind in the electricity sector. Globally, policies have  largely driven the expansion of renewable energy. The number  of countries promoting renewables through direct policy  support continued to grow in 2014, albeit at varying rates and  in response to diverse drivers. As circumstances change and  level of RE increases, the policy mechanisms required will  change as well. While grid integration issues due to ever  increasing shares of wind and solar Pv are most pressing in  developed countries, access to technology and financial  resources is the highest priority in developing countries.  Policy frameworks must be stable and predictable in order to  underpin the sustained deployment of renewable energy. The  industry needs predictable policy frameworks in order to be  ready to invest, build up production capacities, develop new  technologies and expand skilled employees. Moreover, there  is a close correlation between supporting policies and the  cost of renewable energy technology.  Price support mechanisms for renewable energy are a  practical way to correct market failures in the electricity  sector. They aim to support market penetration of those  renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar  thermal, that currently suffer from unfair competition due to  direct and indirect support to fossil fuel use and nuclear  energy, and to provide incentives for technology  improvements and cost reductions so that technologies such  as Pv, wave and tidal can compete with conventional sources  in the future.  Overall, there are two types of incentive to promote the  deployment of renewable energy. These are fixed Price  Systems and Renewable Quota Systems (referred to in the  uS as Renewable Portfolio Standards). In the former, the  government sets the price (or premium) paid to the power  producer and lets the market determine the quantity; in the  latter, the government sets the quantity of renewable  electricity and leaves it to the market to determine the price.  both systems create a protected market against a  background of subsidised, depreciated conventional  generators whose external environmental costs are not  accounted for. These policies provide incentives for  technology improvements and cost reductions, leading to  cheaper renewables that will be able to compete with  conventional sources in the future.  The main difference between quota-based and price-based  systems is that the former tends to promote the renewable  energy source that is the cheapest, which is generally  onshore wind power. In doing so, this policy thus gives the  most support to the energy source that needs the least. In  contrast, price-based policies spread support across  numerous renewable energy sources more equally, including  those that are currently more expensive and need greater  support. In doing so, they ramp up fledgling industries to  bring costs down.  However, competition between technology manufacturers is  the most crucial factor in bringing down electricity production  costs. Only if large volumes of equipment can be  manufactured, cost reduction potential can be fully exploited.  So the goal of fighter policy should be large-scale  deployment towards bringing about economies of scale  among manufacturers.  A bankable support scheme for renewable energy projects  provide long-term stability and lead to lower “soft costs” (less  red tape). In any case, renewable power generation requires  priority access and dispatch on the power grid so renewables  are not curtailed in favour of more polluting power sources.  The substantial cost reductions of renewables are largely the  result of policy support, which has attracted significant  investments leading to economies of scale. However, abrupt  policy change of policies, such as a sudden reversal of feedin  tariffs, can have major negative impacts for the industry as  a whole. Therefore, any transition towards a new policy  system requires sufficient time, both in the lead-up to  implementation and in duration of the new policy itself so that  industry can adapt its business model.  Today, the penetration of renewables is no longer a question  of technology or economics but one of developing more  flexible markets, smarter energy systems and – especially for  developing countries – access to finance. This policy shift  must be underpinned by the appropriate regulations,  business, and finance models.  100% renewables: aiming high to drive the transition  High targets for renewable energy – across all sectors –  trigger innovation. A complete transition towards renewable  energy requires the development of new policies to support  business models in an ever changing energy market design.  Setting ambitious long-term renewable energy targets will  help to organize the energy transition across all three sectors.  Thus new policies are needed to restructure the electric  power and heating markets, and to develop regulations to  provide a fair and efficient basis for blending centralized and  distributed generation with demand-flexibility measures. Our  thinking about future energy systems needs to focus on how  existing infrastructure must be adapted and enhanced to  accommodate the ongoing integration of large shares of  renewable energy.    harnessing local action to ensure global renewable energy uptake  Today, local governments are leaders in the advancement of  renewable energy, particularly in combination with energy  efficiency improvements. They regularly exceed efforts made  by state, provincial, and national governments. Motivated to  create local jobs, reduce energy costs, address pollution  issues, and advance their sustainability goals, hundreds of  local governments worldwide have set renewable energy  targets and enacted fiscal incentives or other policies to  foster the deployment of renewables. Governments at the  community, city, regional, island, and even country levels  have begun to forge their own transition pathways towards a  100% renewable energy future. A better linking of local  renewable energy developments with those at the national  level will be key to driving the energy transition.  creating a level playing field for the entire energy sector  Global subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power remain  high despite reform efforts. The exact level of subsides is  unknown; estimates range from uSD 544 billion (World bank)  to uSD 1.9 trillion per year (International Monetary fund),  depending on how “subsidy” is defined. Whichever number is  chosen, subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power are  significantly higher than financial support for renewables.  Electricity price subsidies for consumers in developing  countries should be shifted towards Distributed Renewable  Energy (DRE). Creating a level playing field can lead to a more  efficient allocation of financial resources, helping to  strengthen initiatives for the development and implementation  of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.  Removing fossil-fuel and nuclear subsidies globally would  reflect more accurately the true cost of energy generation.  improving energy data to monitor advancements in achieving a  renewable energy transition  Reliable, timely, and regularly updated data on renewable  energy are essential for establishing energy plans, defining  targets, designing and continuously evaluating policy  measures, and attracting investment. The data situation for  renewable energy – especially in the power sector - has  improved significantly in recent years. better record-keeping,  accessibility, and advances in communication and collection  methods have contributed greatly to this development.  Nonetheless, the availability, accessibility, and quality of data  for distributed renewable energy and bioenergy is still poor.  To overcome some of these existing data gaps, it is essential  to develop innovative and collaborative approaches to data  collection, processing, and validation. until recently,  “acceptable data” have been limited to official statistics  (formal data). for an accurate and timely understanding of  the status of the renewable energy sector, official renewable  energy data need to be supplemented with informal data.  The addition of informal data can improve coverage of  sectors and regions and help resolve the lack of data;  however, previously uninvolved players from varying sectors  would then need to be involved. Many of these individual and  institutional actors typically have already engaged in some  form of data collection but are unaware of the importance of  their data or lack the means of sharing them. Additionally,  cross-sector methods and approaches for data collection  must be considered. by utilizing links between energy and  other sectors, such as health and agriculture, data gaps can  be filled and data quality improved. There is a critical need to  broaden the definition of renewable energy data, to collect  data in a regular and more systematic manner, and to  increase transparency.  renewable power: (energy) system thinking required in  developed countries  With increased shares of variable solar and wind power  generation, a variety of technologies need to be integrated in  one resilient power supply system. Thus, policy  developments should shift away from single-technology  support schemes towards ones that support a combination of  diverse technologies. Policies need to transform power grids  to become more flexible, increase demand-side integration,  and integrate power systems with transport, buildings,  industry, and heating and cooling sectors.  utilities and grid operators will also play an important role in  managing demand and generation in renewable energydominated  energy systems. Demand-side management of  industries, transport systems and households and the  operation of distributed generation fleets require different  energy policies to enable new business models. Achieving a  renewable energy technology mix which can be used for  dispatching - also across the power, heating/cooling and  transport sector - is important.  Heating systems, such as heat pumps or district heating  networks can be used to better integrate solar and wind  power. The German “Energiewende” (German for “energy  transition”) has inspired many countries, helping to build new  momentum around renewable energy. Experiences with  system integration in industrialized countries such as Spain,  Germany, Denmark and the uS can help develop future  concepts for developing countries to help establish trust that  energy supply can fundamentally build on RE.  the renewable heating and cooling sector lacks progress  To achieve the transition towards renewable energy, more  attention needs to be paid to the heating and cooling sectors,  as well as to integrated approaches that facilitate the use of  renewables in this sector. Globally, heating and cooling  accounts for almost half of total global energy demand.  However, this sector continues to lag far behind the    renewable power sector when it comes to policies that  support technology development and deployment. Policies  should make sure that specific targets and appropriate  measures to support renewable heating and cooling are part  of any national renewable energy strategy. They should  include financial incentives; awareness-raising campaigns;  training for installers, architects and heating engineers; and  demonstration projects.  for new buildings and those undergoing major renovation, a  minimum share of heat consumption from renewable energy  should be required, as is already implemented in some  countries. At the same time, increased R&D efforts should be  undertaken, particularly in the fields of heat storage and  renewable cooling. Mandatory regulations in the building  sector can also help increase the penetration of renewable  technologies. Improving the accuracy of national data  collection on heating and cooling supply and demand is also  important. The distributed nature of heat supply and local  demand make it difficult to know what sources are available  and what is needed; this information is crucial for good policy  development. The expansion of district heating networks  supports both the development of renewable energy heating  and benefits the integration of variable power generation.  Heating networks can be utilized for demand side  management, relieving pressure on power grids. A smart  combination of heating and power grids can also reduce the  need for grid expansion, decreasing costs further.  getting the policy mix right in developing countries  In developing countries, access to financial resources,  technology, and information is key. Many developing  countries also have a steep energy demand, particularly in  the industrial sector. Ensuring the energy supply for heavy  industries and for small and medium enterprises is crucial for  the economic development of these countries. With  renewable energy – modular and highly standardized power  technologies – expanding energy supply for all consumer  groups is not a technological, but a political challenge.  Access to expertise and financial resources requires stable,  long-term energy policies.  There is also an urgent need to address the lack of access to  energy services and inefficiencies in the provision of energy  services to the urban poor and rural communities. Improved  energy access is crucial towards advancing the quality of life  and socio-economic status of these populations, in turn  contributing to political stability on national, regional and  international levels and helping to improve economic growth  and environmental sustainability. Renewables have a key role  to play in increasing access through distributed solutions.  Stand-alone cooking and electricity systems based on  renewables are often the most cost-effective options  available for providing energy services to households and  businesses in remote areas. Supporting the development of  distributed renewable energy-based systems to expand  energy access is essential. Combined with information and  communication technology (ICT) applications for power  management and end-user services, recent technical  advances that enable the integration of renewables in minigrid  systems allow for rapid growth in the use of mini-grids  powered with renewables.  There is growing awareness that off-grid, low-income  customers can provide fast-growing markets for goods and  services. The emergence of new business and financing  models to serve them means that these energy markets are  increasingly recognized as offering potential business  opportunities. Despite some progress on expanding energy  access in different parts of the world, some 1.3 billion people  still lack access to electricity, and more than 2.6 billion  people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating,  with the related negative health impacts. In order to support  the expansion of energy markets to reach full energy access  – as promoted by SE4ALL – the public and private sector  need to actively work together to ensure the financing of  distributed renewable energy by developing and  implementing support policies, establishing broader legal  frameworks, and ensuring political stability.  efficiency: set stringent efficiency and emissions standards for  appliances, buildings, power plants and vehicles  Policies and measures to promote energy efficiency exist in  many countries. Energy and information labels, mandatory  minimum energy performance standards and voluntary  efficiency agreements are the most popular measures.  Effective government policies usually contain two elements -  those that use standards to push the market and those that  use incentives to pull. both are an effective, low cost way to  transition to greater energy efficiency.  The japanese front-runner programme, for example, is a  regulatory scheme with mandatory targets which gives  incentives to manufacturers and importers of energy-consuming  equipment to continuously improve the efficiency  of their products. It operates by allowing today’s best models  on the market to set the level for future standards.  32    2  33  support innovation in energy efficiency, low carbon transport  systems and renewable energy production  Innovation will play an important role in the Energy [R]evolution,  and it is needed for ever-improving efficiency and emissions  standards. Programmes supporting renewable energy and  energy efficiency are a traditional focus of energy and  environmental policies because energy innovations face  barriers all along the energy supply chain (from R&D to  demonstration projects and widespread deployment). Direct  government support through a variety of fiscal instruments,  such as tax incentives, is vital to hasten deployment of radically  new technologies that face a lack of industry investment. There  is thus a role for the public sector towards increasing  investments directly and in correcting market and regulatory  obstacles that inhibit investment in new technology.  Governments need to invest in research and development for  more efficient appliances and building techniques, new forms  of insulation, new types of renewable energy production  (such as tidal and wave power), and a low-carbon transport  future, such as the development of better batteries for plugin  electric cars and renewable fuels for aviation. Governments  need to engage in innovation themselves, both through  publicly funded research and by supporting private research  and development.  There are numerous ways to support innovation. The most  important policies are those that reduce the cost of research  and development, such as tax incentives, staff subsidies and  project grants. financial support for research and  development on ‘dead end’ energy solutions such as nuclear  fusion should be diverted to supporting renewable energy,  energy efficiency and distributed energy solutions.  transport  • emissions standards: Governments should regulate the  efficiency of private cars and other transport vehicles in  order to push manufacturers to reduce emissions through  downsizing, design and technology improvement.  Improvements in efficiency will reduce CO2 emissions  irrespective of the fuel used. Afterwards, further reductions  could be achieved with low-emission fuels. Emissions  standards should provide for a mandatory average  reduction of 5g CO2 /km/year in industrialised countries. To  dissuade car makers from overpowering high-end cars, a  maximum CO2 emissions limit for individual car models  should be introduced.  • electric vehicles: Governments should develop incentives to  promote the further development of electric cars and other  efficient and sustainable low-carbon transport  technologies. Linking electric cars to a renewable energy  grid is the best possible option to reduce emissions from  the transport sector.  • transport demand management: : Governments should invest  in developing, improving and promoting low emission  transport options, such as public and non-motorised  transport, freight transport management programmes,  teleworking and more efficient land use planning in order to  limit journeys.  the key requirements for effective (renewable) energy policies are:  • long-term security for the investment: Investors need to know  if energy policy will remain stable over the entire investment  period (until the generator is paid off). Investors want a  good return on investment, and while there is no universal  definition of a “good return,” it depends to a large extent on  the inflation rate of the country. Germany, for example, has  an average inflation rate of 2% per year and a minimum  return of investment expected by the financial sector is 6%  to 7%. Achieving 10% to 15% returns is seen as extremely  good and everything above 20% is seen as suspicious.  • long-term security for market conditions: Investor need to  know if the electricity or heat from the power plant can be  sold to the market for a price that guarantees a good return  on investment (ROI). If the ROI is high, the financial sector  will invest, it is low compared to other investments, and  financial institutions will not invest.  • transparent Planning Process: A transparent planning  process is key for project developers, so they can sell the  planned project to investors or utilities. The entire licensing  process must be clear and transparent.  • access to the grid: fair access to the grid is essential for  renewable power plants. If no grid connection is available  or if the costs to access the grid are too high, the project  will not be built. In order to operate a power plant, investors  must know if the asset can reliably deliver and sell  electricity to the grid. If a specific power plant (such as a  wind farm) does not have priority access to the grid, the  operator might have to switch the plant off when there is an  oversupply from other power plants or a bottleneck in the  grid. This arrangement can add high risk to the project  financing, which might then not be financed or only with a  “risk-premium” that lowers the ROI.    bankable renewable energy support schemes  Since the early development of renewable energies within the  power sector, there has been an on-going debate about the  best and most effective type of support scheme. The  European Commission published a survey in December 2005,  which concluded that feed -in tariffs are by far the most  efficient and successful mechanism. A more recent update of  this report, presented in March 2010 at the IEA Renewable  Energy Workshop by the fraunhofer Institute underscores the  same conclusion. The Stern Review on the Economics of  Climate Change also concluded that feed -in tariffs “achieve  larger deployment at lower costs”. Globally more than 40  countries have adopted some version of the system.  Although the organisational form of these tariffs differs from  country to country, some criteria have emerged as essential  for successful renewable energy policy. At the heart of these  is a reliable, bankable support scheme for renewable projects  to provide long-term stability and certainty. bankable support  schemes result in lower-cost projects because they lower the  risk for both investors and equipment suppliers. The cost of  wind power in Germany is up to 40% cheaper than in the  united kingdom, for example, partly because the support  system is more secure and reliable.  for developing countries, feed-in laws would be an ideal  mechanism to boost the development of new renewable  energy. The extra costs to consumers’ electricity bills are an  obstacle for countries with low average incomes. However,  countries that build wind and solar projects today do not face  the high costs that Germany, for instance, did only a few years  ago, so the cost impact on countries that start now will be  much lower. In order to enable technology transfer from Annex  1 countries under the kyoto Protocol to developing countries,  a mix of a feed-in laws, international finance, and emissions  trading could establish a locally based renewable energy  infrastructure and industry with help from wealthier countries.  finance for renewable energy projects is one of the main  obstacles in developing countries. While large-scale projects  have fewer funding problems, there are difficulties for small,  community-based projects, even though they have a high  degree of public support. The experience from micro credits for  small hydro projects in bangladesh, for example, and wind  farms in Denmark and Germany shows how economic benefits  can flow to local communities. With careful project planning  based on good local knowledge and understanding, projects  can achieve local involvement and acceptance. When the  community identifies with the project (as opposed to the  project being forced on the community), the result is generally  faster bottom-up growth of the renewable energy sector.  the four main elements for successful renewable energy support  schemes are therefore:  • a clear, bankable pricing system.  • Priority access to the grid with clear identification of who is  responsible for the connection, and how it is incentivised.  • Clear, simple administrative and planning permission  procedures.  • Public acceptance/support.  The first is fundamental, but it is insufficient without the other  three elements.  greenpeace and the renewable industry: required changes in the  energy sector:  Greenpeace and the renewable energy industry share a clear  agenda for the policy changes which need to be made to  encourage a shift to renewable sources.  the main demands are:  1. Phase out all subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear energy.  2. internalise external (social and environmental) costs through  carbon taxation and/or ‘cap and trade’ emissions trading.  3. mandate strict efficiency standards for all energy consuming  appliances, buildings and vehicles.  4. establish legally binding targets for renewable energy and  combined heat and power generation.  5. set ambitious and mandatory targets for the short, mid and  long term along with supportive policies for their  implementation;  6. reform electricity markets by guaranteeing priority access to  the grid for renewable power generators.  7. establish cross-sectorial re support schemes to exploit  synergies between the power, heating/cooling and transport  sectors.  8. Provide defined and stable returns for investors, for example  through feed-in tariff payments.  9. if changing circumstances, such as plummeting costs, require  a transition to new policy mechanisms, interruption must be  avoided and predictability needs to remain for investors;  10. increase research and development budgets for renewable  energy and energy efficiency.    t h e e n e r gy [ r ] e v o lu t i o n c o n c e P t    Since the first Energy [R]evolution was published a  decade ago, the energy sector has changed significantly.  Renewable energy technologies have become mainstream  in most countries as a consequence of dramatically  reduced costs. A future renewable energy supply is no  longer science fiction, but work in progress.  However, growth rates of renewables – especially in the  heating/cooling sector and in transport – are far too slow  to achieve energy-related CO2 reductions required to  avoid dangerous climate change. A fundamental shift in  the way we consume and generate energy must begin  immediately and be well underway before 2020 in order to  avert the worst impacts of climate change.1 We need to  limit global warming to less than 2° Celsius, above which  the impacts become devastating.  3.1 status quo of the global energy sector  Every day, The International Energy Agency published an  evaluation of the current development of the Energy Sector in  May 2015 (IEA – TCEP 2015),2 which concluded that the  implementation of renewables and energy efficiency is  successful but too slow to meet the 2°C target. Here are  some of the IEA’s conclusions:  Costs: Increasingly, renewables are competitive with new  fossil fuel plants, and the cost gap between renewable  electricity and fossil power from new plants is closing  worldwide. Nonetheless, markets still do not reflect the true  environmental cost of power generation from fossil fuels.  Policy: Power markets must be redesigned to accommodate  variable, distributed renewables. Obstacles still exist for the  financing of renewable energy projects and grid connections,  thereby slowing down the transition. but the worst policy  mistakes are uncertainty and retroactive changes.  technology: Cogeneration and renewable heat have both  grown in absolute terms, but are not increasing quickly  enough as a share of energy supply. The share of  cogeneration in power supply has even stagnated. Likewise,  battery storage has mainly been developed for mobility up to  now but is increasingly used for frequency regulation to  integrate a greater share of variable renewables.  mobility: Electric vehicles are catching on, with an increasing  number of manufacturers now offering hybrid and electric  options. fuel efficiency standards have also made light  vehicles more efficient. The standard should now be applied  to larger trucks and buses.  buildings: The technologies are available, and targets are in  place in many regions. However, the rate and depth of  energy-efficient renovations needs to increase for true  progress to be made in this sector because the building stock  has a service life counted in decades.  The Renewable Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21)  has undertaken a global renewable market analysis each year  in june since 2004. The publication – “Renewables – Global  Status Report” – is among the most comprehensive global  and national surveys of the renewable industry sector.  According to their latest edition, the global renewable energy  market in 2014 was dominated by three power generation  technologies: Solar photovoltaics (Pv), wind, and hydro.  Combined, these technologies added 127 GW of new power  generation capacity worldwide. by year’s end, renewables  made up an estimated 60% of net additions to the global  power capacity. In several countries renewables represented  a higher share of added capacity (REN21-2015).3 The  increase in market volume and strong global competition led  to significant cost reductions, especially for solar Pv and  wind power. As a result, other renewable energy technologies  were under pressure to lower costs, particularly in the heating  and cooling sector due to the increased competitiveness of  electricity-based heating systems. Cost competitive solar Pv  in combination with electrical heat pumps became  economically viable, negatively impacting the solar thermal  collector market.  While developments in the renewable energy, heating and  cooling sector were slower than in the power sector, the  markets for solar thermal collectors and geothermal heat  pumps grew by 9%. bio-heat production remained stable in  2014, increasing only 1% from 2013 levels. The lack of  infrastructure for heating systems and an uncertain policy  environment impeded the development of the renewable  energy renewable energy heating market (REN21-2015).  The number of electric vehicles worldwide doubled year over  year to 665,000. E-mobility and recent developments in  battery storage (including significant cost reductions) are  likely to change the future role of renewable energy in the  transport sector. biofuels, however, are still the main  renewable fuel source used in the transport sector and grew  8.4% in 2014 compared the previous year (REN21-2015).  In conclusion, developments in the heating/cooling sector and  the transport sector in particular are far too slow. Despite all  the success in the renewable power sector, the extreme  growth of coal power generation, especially in China,  undercuts many successes with renewables. However, the first  sign of a stagnation of coal demand in China – even a small  decline for the first time in 2014 – provides reason to hope. The  political framework of energy markets must adapt to the new  emerging, mostly distributed energy technologies in order to  support the transition to 100% renewable energy supply.  Thus, Energy [R]evolution has begun, especially in the power  sector, but heating and transport significantly lag behind.  Overall, the transition from fossil and nuclear fuels to  renewables is too slow, and energy demand is still growing  too quickly.  36    3  37  3.2 setting up an energy [r]evolution scenario  This section explains the basic principles and strategic  approach of the development of the Energy [R]evolution  concepts, which have served as a basis for the scenario  modelling since the very first Energy [R]evolution scenario  published in 2005. The Energy [R]evolution scenario series  follows a “seven-step logic,” which stretches from the  evaluation of natural resource limits to key drivers for energy  demand and energy efficiency potentials, an analysis of  available technologies and their market development  potential, and specific policy measures required to implement  a theoretical concept on real markets. This concept, however,  has been constantly improved as technologies develop and  new technical and economical possibilities emerge.  the seven steps are:  1. define natural limits for the climate and fuel resources.  2. define renewable energy resource limits.  3. identify drivers for demand.  4. define efficiency potentials by sector.  5. establish time lines for implementation.  6. identify required infrastructure.  7. identify required policies.  One of the major changes we have made in the Energy  [R]evolution concept over the past years is to give solar  photovoltaics a significantly increasing role in the energy  sector and electric mobility a more important role due to  better battery technology. both solar Pv and storage  technologies are potentially disruptive; they could turn the  energy sector on its head a relatively quickly.  3.3 the energy [r]evolution logic  1. define natural limits:  the phase-out cascade for fossil fuels: Geological resources of  coal could provide several hundred years of fuel, but we cannot  burn them and keep within safe climate change limits. Thus,  lignite – as the most carbon intensive coal – must be phased-out  first, followed by hard coal. The use of oil will be phased-out in  the pace of production depletion of existing oil wells (see  chapter 5), and no new deep sea and Arctic / Antarctic oil wells  will be opened.  Gas production follows the same logic as oil and will be phased  out as the last fossil fuel.  reduce energy-related carbon dioxide to zero by mid-century:  There is only so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb.  Each year we emit almost 30 billion tonnes of carbon  equivalents. The Energy [R]evolution scenario has a target to  phase-out energy-related CO2 emissions by 2050. In addition,  the regional transition towards carbon-free energy supply aims  to achieve energy equity – shifting towards a fairer worldwide  distribution of efficiently-used supply – as soon as technically  possible. by 2040, the average per capita emission should be  between 0.5 and 1 tonne of CO2.  2. define renewable energy resource limits:  renewable energy resource – mapping the future energy mix:  The 5 renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal  and ocean) are available in different quantities – both by region  and by season. Specific renewable energy potential maps are  available from a number of scientific research institutions for each  country around the world. The German Aerospace Centre takes  part in the global mapping project of the International Renewable  Energy Agency (IRENA), which provides detailed data for all  renewable energy resources (IRENA-Global Atlas 2015).4 The  various regional renewable energy resources influence the  projected energy mix in Energy [R]evolution scenarios.  bioenergy – an important resource with limited sustainable  potential: bioenergy is needed for fossil fuel replacement where no  other technical alternative is available. Energy [R]evolution  scenarios use bioenergy especially for industrial process heat,  aviation, shipping and heavy machinery. Greenpeace identified the  sustainable bioenergy potential globally in a scientific survey in 2008  at around 80 to maximum 100 Ej per year (Dbfz 2008).5 The  overall sustainable bioenergy potential is, however, subject to  change due to technical and scientific development and / or change  of usage. An increased use of biomass for plastics, for example,  would reduce the resources available for energy conversion.    3. identify drivers for demand:  equity and fair access to energy for all: The global and regional  population development pathways are taken from united Nations  projections (uN 2014).6 Greenpeace does neither undertake any  of its own population projections, nor is family planning part of  the Energy [R]evolution energy scenario efficiency concept.  However, a focus for future energy demand projections lies on a  fair distribution of benefits and costs within societies, between  nations, and between present and future generations. At one  extreme, a third of the world’s population has no access to  electricity, whilst the most industrialised countries consume  much more than their fair share. The Energy [R]evolution  concept aims to supply energy for an equal living standard for  every person by 2050 if required economic development is  believed to take place. (for further information, see chapter 5.)  decouple growth from fossil fuel use: The projections for  economic growth are based on the International Energy  Agencies (IEA) World Energy Outlook projections (for further  information, see chapter 5). Starting in the developed countries,  economic growth must be fully decoupled from fossil fuel usage.  It is a fallacy to suggest that economic growth must be  predicated on increased fossil fuel combustion.  4. define efficiency potentials by sector:  energy not used is the cheapest; smart use of energy needed:  Electrical appliances, industrial process, heating and cooling of  buildings, and all forms of transport technologies still have  significant efficiency potential. The latest available technologies  in all sectors are implemented within the range of normal  replacement rates. Energy [R]evolution scenarios focus on  efficiency rather than sufficiency in the power and  heating/cooling sector. The transport sector requires sufficiency  especially in regard to usage of individual cars and aviation. A  modular shift from road to rail and from air to rail where ever  possible as an example of sufficiency.  5. establish time lines for implementation:  there is no renewable energy shortage as such: The sun sends  more energy to the earth surface per day than we consume each  year. However, renewable energy technologies need to be  engineered, installed, and operated, which requires skilled  labour, financial resources and adapted energy policies. The  transition from a fossil to a largely renewable energy supply  system will take time. Energy [R]evolution scenarios take past  experiences into account in determining how fast renewable  energy technologies can scale up. In particular, the experience  of Denmark, Germany and China during the last decade showed  that a certain time is needed to train workers and set up required  industries and infrastructure. An overheated renewable industry  with low-quality products does more damage than good to a  long-term transition. Thus, Energy [R]evolution scenarios are  ambitious but not unrealistic. The first decade of our RE  development pathways are based on industries projections such  as from the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC 2015)7 and Solar  Power Europe (SPE 2015).8  6. identify required infrastructure:  smart grids are key, as is solar and wind power integration:  Increased shares of distributed solar photovoltaic and onshore  wind in distribution and medium voltage grids and offshore wind  and concentrated solar power generation connected to  transmission grids require the development of infrastructure,  both for the physical setup and for management (brown et. al.  2014).9 Also, the distribution of generation capacities across  different voltage levels has a significant influence on required  grid expansion and/or dispatch capacities (Teske 2015).10  Existing gas pipelines and storage facilities might be available for  the transport and storage of renewable hydrogen and/or  methane. Existing gas power plants can therefore be used as  dispatch plants to avoid stranded investments.  storage – the next big thing: The development of electric  vehicles has triggered more research in storage technologies,  especially batteries. Increased shares of wind and solar caused  another wave of research and market development for storage  technologies, such as hydrogen, renewable methane and  pumped hydro power plants. Storage technologies have thus  improved significantly. Energy [R]evolution scenarios, however,  aim to minimize storage needs for the next decade as costs are  expected to remain high for that time frame. In the medium to  long term, storage technologies are needed especially to replace  fossil fuels with electricity in the transport sector.  7. identify required policies:  new energy markets need new energy policies: Climate and  energy policy need to go hand in hand. The uNfCCC process  (see chapter 1) is key to protect the global climate, just as  national energy policies are key to implement the required  emission reduction with renewables and energy efficiency. The  Energy [R]evolution scenarios are based on the experience  documented in policy analysis, such as from REN 21 (REN21),11  IRENA (IRENA 2015)12 and the IEA (IEA 2015 A). Specific policy  recommendations are documented in chapter 2 of this report.  38    3  39  3.4 the “5 step implementation”  In 2013, renewable energy sources accounted for 19% of the  world’s final energy demand. Modern renewables, such as  solar, wind and geothermal energy, accounted for 10%, while  traditional biomass contributed 9%. The latter often causes  environmental damage and thus need to be replaced with new  renewables as well. The share of renewable energy in electricity  generation was 22.8% in 2013, a 5% increase over the past 4  years. About 78% of primary energy supply today still comes  from fossil fuels13 - a decrease of 3 % over the past 4 years.  Now is the time to make substantial structural changes in the  energy and power sector within the next decade. Many power  plants in industrialised countries, such as the uSA, japan  and the European union, are nearing retirement; more than  half of all operating power plants are over 20 years old. At the  same time developing countries, such as China, India, South  Africa and brazil, are looking to satisfy the growing energy  demand created by their expanding economies.  Worldwide, there is good news: Pv and wind are growing  strongly. In 2015, roughly 50 GW of solar is expected to be  installed, up from 30 GW annually at the beginning of this  decade. This year, the global Pv market also crossed the 200  GW threshold. by the end of the decade, nearly half that much  could be installed annually. Likewise, after years of roughly 30-  40 GW of annual additions, the wind market grew in 2014 by  over 50 GW and will cross the 400 GW threshold this year.  This market as well could grow to around 90 GW annually by  the end of this decade. because the capacity factors of wind  turbines are generally double that of Pv, twice as much wind  power would be generated from these additions.  Within this decade, the power sector will decide how new  electricity demand will be met, either by fossil and nuclear  fuels or by the efficient use of renewable energy. The Energy  [R]evolution scenario puts forwards a policy and technical  model for renewable energy and cogeneration combined with  energy efficiency to meet the world’s needs.  Renewable energy and cogeneration – both as central-station  power plants and distributed units – have to grow faster than  overall global energy demand. both approaches must replace  old generating technologies and deliver the additional energy  required in the developing world.  A transitional phase is required to build up the necessary  infrastructure because it is not possible to switch directly from  a large-scale fossil and nuclear energy system to a fully  renewable energy supply. Whilst remaining firmly committed to  the promotion of renewable sources of energy, we appreciate  that conventional natural gas, used in appropriately scaled  cogeneration plants, is valuable as a transition fuel, and can  also drive cost-effective decentralisation of the energy  infrastructure. With warmer summers, tri-generation – which  incorporates heat-fired absorption chillers to deliver cooling  capacity in addition to heat and power – will become a  valuable means of achieving emissions reductions. The Energy  [R]evolution envisages a development pathway away from the  present energy supply structure and towards a sustainable  system. There are three main stages to this.    step 1: energy efficiency and equity  The Energy [R]evolution requires an ambitious exploitation of  energy efficiency. The focus is on current best practices and  products, along with probable future technologies, assuming  continuous innovation. The energy savings are fairly equally  distributed over the three sectors – industry, transport and  domestic/business. Intelligent use, not abstinence, is the  basic philosophy.  The most important energy saving options are improved heat  insulation and building design, super-efficient electrical  machines and drives, replacement of old style electrical  heating systems by renewable heat production (such as solar  collectors) and a reduction in energy consumption by vehicles  used for goods and passenger traffic.  by the end of this decade, new buildings in Europe will have  to be “nearly zero-carbon,” which is an excellent step  forwards, though it comes a bit late – Passive House  architecture was proven two decades ago. This energyefficient  architecture can be used worldwide in almost all  climates, both to reduce heating demand (such as in  southern Canadian cities) as well as cooling demand (from  Las vegas to Dubai). However, the greatest gains are to be  made not in new buildings, but in renovations. Here,  governments must speed up the renovation rate of existing  building stock, and all renovations must be ambitious in light  of long building service lives. Moreover, the comfort gains  from such architecture make these buildings a pleasure to live  and work in; here, intelligent energy use is clearly about  better living, not abstinence.  Industrialised countries currently use energy most  inefficiently. They can reduce their consumption drastically  without losing either housing comfort or gadgets. The Energy  [R]evolution scenario depends on OECD countries to save  energy as developing countries increase theirs. The ultimate  goal is stable global energy consumption within the next two  decades. Another aim is to ‘energy equity’.  A dramatic reduction in primary energy demand compared to  the Reference scenario – but with the same GDP and  population development - is a crucial prerequisite for  achieving a significant share of renewable energy sources in  the overall energy supply, compensating for the phasing out  of nuclear energy and reduction in fossil fuel consumption.  step 2: the renewable energy revolution  decentralised energy and large scale renewables  Decentralised energy is connected to a local distribution  network system, to which homes, offices, and small businesses  are generally connected. Energy [R]evolution scenarios make  extensive use of Distributed Energy (DE): energy generated at  or near the point of use. We define distributed power generation  as applications connected to low-and medium-voltage power  lines with an average transport distance from several hundred  meters up to around 100 kilometres. Several different  distributed power plant technologies are available: solar  photovoltaics, onshore wind turbines, run-of-river hydro power  plants, bioenergy and geothermal power plants, and potentially  near-shore ocean energy plants.  40    3  41  The dominant renewable electricity source is now wind power,  but photovoltaics will catch up in the future. Significant cost  reduction of solar photovoltaic roof-top systems is leading to  “grid parity” in almost all industrialized countries. Households  and small businesses can then produce their own solar power  for the same or a lower cost than rates for grid electricity; onsite  power generation - a term usually used for industry - now  makes economic sense for the private sector.  Distributed energy also includes stand-alone systems for  heating / cooling either connected to district heating networks  or for a single building supply, such as solar thermal collectors,  bio energy heat systems and (geothermal) heat pumps. A  hybrid between renewables and energy efficiency, heat pumps  convert one unit of electricity into up to 4 units of heat.  All these decentralized technologies can be commercialised  for domestic users to provide sustainable, low-carbon  energy. Increased shares of distributed generation  technologies require adapted energy policies for “prosumers”  – consumers who produce own energy.  This option opens up a whole new market for solar  photovoltaics and turns the business model for utilities on its  head (see new business models). Those who were once  captive utility customers will become utility competitors.  Energy [R]evolution scenarios assume that private consumer  and small and medium enterprises (SME) will meet most of  their electricity needs with solar photovoltaic and storage if  space to set up the system is accessible. Therefore, utilities  will lose most of their customers connected to the distribution  grid until 2030 for electricity sales from centralized power  plants. Therefore, utilities will have to move from selling  energy to selling energy services by managing the operation  and dispatch of decentralized generation capacity.  Industry and business can use cogeneration power plants and  co-generation batteries for on-site power generation to cover  their own power needs. Surplus power will be sold to the grid,  while excess heat can to be piped to nearby buildings, a system  known as combined heat and power. for a fuel like (bio-) gas,  almost all the input energy is used, not just a fraction as with  traditional central-station fossil fuel electricity plants.  While a large proportion of global energy in 2050 will be produced  by decentralised energy sources, large-scale renewable energy  will still be needed for an energy revolution. Large offshore wind  farms and concentrating solar power (CSP) plants in the Sunbelt  regions of the world will therefore have an important but broader  role to play. Offshore wind turbines produce electricity more hours  of the day, thereby reducing the need for backup generators, and  CSP with storage is dispatchable. Centralized renewable energy  will also be needed to provide process heat for industry and  desalination (in the case of CSP), to supply increase power  demand for the heating and transport sector, and to produce  synthetic fuels for the transport sector.    step 3: the transport revolution  moving around with different technologies and less energy  Switching to 100% renewables is most challenging in the  transport sector. Today 92% of the transport energy comes  from oil and only 1% from electricity (IEA 2015 b).14 A simple  “fuel switch” from oil to bio energy and electricity is neither  technically possible nor sustainable. While there is an urgent  need to expand electric mobility – public and individual  transport technologies such as trains, busses, cars, and  trucks – we also need to re-think our current mobility concept  as such. The design of (mega-) cities has a huge influence  whether people have to commute long distances or if they  can walk or bike to work (WfC 2014).15 On the other hand,  increasing urban populations offer an opportunity to increase  the usage of environmentally friendly mass transit systems.  The transport of freight needs to move from road to rail and –  if possible – from aviation to ships, which requires better  logistics and new, more efficiency transport technologies (see  chapter 12).  Cars evolve in Energy [R]evolution scenarios. All potentials to  make cars lighter and the combustion engine more efficient  are exploited first. by around 2025, the car market moves via  hybrid drives towards fully electric drives. The e-vehicle  market is still nascent in 2015, and technical uncertainties  remain, especially in regard to the storage technologies. We  therefore do not expect a real turnaround with significant oil  reduction effect before 2025. However the technical evolution  must start now in order to be ready by then.  The use of biofuels is limited by the availability of sustainably  grown biomass. It will primarily be committed to heavy  machinery, aviation and shipping, where electricity does not  seem to be an option for the next few decades. Outside the  transport sector, biomass is needed for specific industries to  supply process heat and carbon – not to mention as a raw  material outside the energy sector. unlike previous Energy  [R]evolution scenarios, this one no longer includes biofuels  for private cars.16 Electric vehicles will therefore play an even  more important role in improving energy efficiency in  transport and substituting for fossil fuels after 2025.  Overall, achieving an economically attractive growth of  renewable energy sources requires a balanced and timely  mobilisation of all technologies. Such a mobilisation depends  on resource availability, cost reduction potential and  technological maturity. And alongside technology driven  solutions, lifestyle changes - like simply driving less and using  more public transport – have a huge potential to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. fortunately, these new behaviour  patterns will be perceived as improvements, not  compromises; young people around the world already  increasingly prefer to spend time on their smart phones and  buses and trains rather than drive.  42    3  43  step 4: smart infrastructure to secure renewables 24/7  because renewable energy relies mostly on natural  resources, which are not available at all times, some critics  say this makes it unsuitable for large portions of energy  demand. yet, Denmark got around 40 percent of its electricity  from wind power alone in 2014; Spain and Portugal, around  a quarter. A complete transformation of the energy system  will be necessary to accommodate the significantly higher  shares of renewable energy expected under the Energy  [R]evolution scenario. The grid network of cables and substations  that brings electricity to our homes and factories was  designed for large, centralised generators running at huge  loads, providing ‘base load’ power. until now, renewable  energy has been seen as an additional slice of the energy mix  and had had to adapt to the grid’s operating conditions. If the  Energy Revolution scenario is to be realised, this situation will  have to change.  Renewable energy supply 24/7 is technically and  economically possible; it just needs the right policy and the  commercial investment to get things moving and ‘keep the  lights on’ (GP-EN 2014).17 The task of integrating renewable  energy technologies into existing power systems is similar in  all power systems around the world, whether they are large,  centralized systems or island systems.  Thorough planning is needed to ensure that the available  production can match demand at all times. In addition to  balancing supply and demand, the power system must also  be able to:  • fulfil defined power quality standards – voltage/frequency –  which may require additional technical equipment in the power  system and support from different ancillary services (see  appendix 1 for definitions of terms); and  • survive extreme situations such as sudden interruptions of  supply (such as a fault at a generation unit) or interruption of the  transmission system.  base load and system balancing  Power balance aims at keeping frequency in the system  consistent. The mains frequency describes the frequency at  which AC electricity is delivered from the generator to the end  user, and it is measured in hertz (Hz). frequency varies in a  system as the load (demand) changes. In a power grid  operating close to its peak capacity, there can be rapid  fluctuations in frequency, and dramatic fluctuations can occur  just before a major power outage. Typically, power systems  were designed around large power stations providing baseload  capacity operating almost constantly at full output. These  centralized units, typically nuclear or coal power plants, are  inflexible generation resources – they don’t “follow load” –  change their output to match changing demand – as well as  flexible gas turbines and hydropower units, for instance.  Power systems with large amounts of inflexible generation  resources, such as nuclear power stations, also require a  significant amount of flexible generation resources.  priority dispatch for renewables ends “base-generation”  Renewable energy integrated into a smart grid changes the  need for base load power. An energy switch based on  renewables redefines the need for “base load” power  generation. Instead, traditional base load power plants such as  coal are replaced by a mix of flexible energy providers that can  follow the load during the day and night (such as solar plus  gas, geothermal, wind and demand management), without  blackouts. The base load is therefore provided by a cascade of  flexible power plants – instead of just baseload generation.

Decentralised energy generation for self-supply along with  utility-scale solar, onshore and offshore wind farms in remote  areas will have a profound impact on the way utilities operate  by 2020. for instance, these energy sources require no fuel,  which will challenge vertically integrated utilities.    The current model is a relatively small number of large power  plants owned and operated by utilities or their subsidiaries,  generating electricity for the population. under the Energy  Revolution scenario, around 60 to 70% of electricity will be  made by small but numerous distributed power plants.  Ownership will shift away from centralised utilities towards  more private investors, manufacturers of renewable energy  technologies and EPC companies (engineering, procurement  and construction). In turn, the value chain for power  companies will shift towards project development, equipment  manufacturing and operation and maintenance (figure 4).  Simply selling electricity to customers will play a smaller role;  power companies of the future will deliver a total power plant  and the required IT services to customers, not just electricity.  They will therefore move towards becoming service providers  for customers. The majority of power plants will also not  require any fuel supply, so fuel production companies will lose  their strategic importance.  Today’s power supply value chain is broken down into clearly  defined players, but a global renewable power supply will  inevitably change this division of roles and responsibilities.  The following table provides an overview of how the value  chain would change in a revolutionised energy mix.  The future pattern under the Energy [R]evolution will see more  and more renewable energy companies, such as wind turbine  manufacturers becoming involved in project development,  installation, and operation and maintenance, whilst utilities  will lose their status. Traditional energy supply companies  that do not move towards renewable project development will  either lose market share or drop out of the market completely.  policy defines ownership and investment flows  In order to organize the transition towards a 100% renewable  energy market, specific policies are required to provide  planning and investment security for small and medium-size  enterprises (SME). Those policies must first and foremost  secure access to infrastructure – power lines, gas pipelines  and district heating systems – so that electricity, hydrogen,  renewable methane and/or renewable heat can be  transported to customers. Priority dispatch in all networks is  key for project developers and investors as well because the  projected amount of renewable energy produced each year is  a fundamental cornerstone for financial planning.    Grid operation will move  towards state controlled  grid companies or  communities due to  liberalisation.  A few large multinational  oil, gas and coal mining  companies dominate:  today approx 75-80%  of power plants need  fuel supply.  Relatively view power plants owned and  sometimes operated by utilities.  Coal, gas and nuclear power stations are larger than renewables. Average  number of power plants needed per 1 GW installed only 1 or 2 projects.    Grid operation will move  towards state controlled  grid companies or  communities due to  liberalisation.  by 2050 almost all power  generation technologies -  accept biomass - will  operate without the need  of fuel supply.  Many projects will be owned by private households  or investment banks in the case of larger projects.  Renewable power plants are small in capacity, the amount of projects  for project development, manufacturers and installation companies per  installed 1 GW is bigger by an order of magnitude. In the case of Pv  it could be up to 500 projects, for onshore wind still 25 to 50 projects.  source DR. SvEN TESkE / GREENPEACE.  47  future customer groups  The capacity demand of power and/or heat for different  customer groups defines the voltage level they are connected  to and whether they are connected to the distribution or  transmission level of gas pipelines. The interface between  customer and infrastructure opens a variety of technology  and hence business options for energy service companies.  for households with access to a roof space, for example, the  installation of solar photovoltaics is now very often a least-cost  option. The cost of photovoltaic electricity has  decreased dramatically over the past few years. Parity with  retail electricity and oil-based fuels has been reached in many  countries and market segments and wholesale parity is  approaching in some markets (beyer 2015).20  figure 3.8 provides a rough overview of technology options  for different customers groups with regard to their  infrastructural needs.  This section only covers a small share of business model  possibilities for utilities. However, it seems relatively clear that  not changing the current conventional business model is not  an option for utilities either.  German utilities are a good example of future challenges. In  2014, RWE – one of Germany’s two biggest utilities along  with Eon – posted a 45 percent drop in profits. Power prices  are down, and the share of conventional electricity is also  falling, so these firms sell less power at lower prices. At RWE,  power sales fell by 7.5 percent in 2014 year over year, for  instance. The result was 29 percent lower operating the  profits from conventional power generation. The outlook is  also dismal, with year-ahead prices dropping to the lowest  level in a decade.  RWE has responded partly by forming a partnership with EPC  (Conergy) for significant investments in rooftop solar in  Germany. Likewise, Eon is breaking up into two companies:  one doing business with conventional energy, and the other  with renewables and energy services. This plan is clear  evidence that top utility experts understand the incompatibility  of conventional energy with renewables.

The table below  provides an overview of the ten steps from “field to an  operating power plant” for renewable energy projects in the  current market situation. Those steps are similar same for  each renewable energy technology; however, steps 3 and 4  are especially important for wind and solar projects. In  developing countries, the government and mostly state-owned  utilities might directly or indirectly act as project  developers. The project developer might also be work as a  subdivision of a state owned utility.

Renewable projects have limited  ramp-up periods, and construction periods of one to three  years, compared to 10 years to build while large  conventional power plants.  • In several countries, renewable energy producers have  been granted priority dispatch. Where in place, grid  operators are usually obliged to connect renewable power  plants to their grid, and retailers or other authorised entities  must purchase all renewable electricity produced.  • Renewable projects present relatively low operational  complexity compared to other energy generation assets  and other infrastructure asset classes. Onshore wind and  solar Pv projects in particular have well established  operational track records. This is obviously less the case  for biomass and offshore wind plants.  • Renewable projects typically have non-recourse financing,  through a mix of debt and equity. In contrast to traditional  corporate lending, project finance relies on future cash flows  for interest and debt repayment, rather than the asset value  or the historical financial performance of a company. Project  finance debt typically covers 70–90% of the cost of a project,  is non-recourse to the investors, and ideally matches the  duration of the underlying contractual agreements.  • Renewable power typically has predictable cash flows and is  not subject to fuel price volatility because the primary energy  resource is generally free (except for biomass). Contractually  guaranteed tariffs along with the moderate cost of building,  operating and maintaining renewable generation facilities  allow for secure profit margins and predictable cash flows.  • Renewable electricity remuneration mechanisms often  include some kind of inflation indexation, although incentive  schemes may vary on a case-by-case basis. for example,  several tariffs in the Eu are indexed to consumer price  indices and adjusted on an annual basis (such as in Spain  and Italy). In projects where specific inflation protection is  not provided (such as in Germany), the regulatory  framework allows selling power on the spot market, should  the power price be higher than the guaranteed tariff.  • Renewable power plants have expected long useful lives  (over 20 years). Transmission lines usually have economic  lives of over 40 years. Renewable assets are typically  underpinned by long-term contracts with utilities and benefit  from governmental support and manufacturer warranties.  • Renewable energy projects deliver attractive and stable  sources of income, only loosely linked to the economic  cycle. Project owners do not have to manage fuel cost  volatility, and projects generate high operating margins with  relatively secure revenues and generally limited market risk.    • The widespread development of renewable power  generation will require significant investments in the  electricity grid. future grid (smart grids) will have to  integrate an ever-increasing, decentralised, fluctuating  supply of renewable energy. furthermore, suppliers and/or  distribution companies will be expected to deliver a  sophisticated range of services by embedding digital grid  devices into power networks.  Risk assessment and allocation is at the centre of project  finance. Accordingly, project structuring and expected return  are directly related to the risk profile of the project. The four  main risk factors to consider when investing in renewable  energy assets are:  • Regulatory risks refer to adverse changes in laws and  regulations, unfavourable tariff setting and changes in and  breaches of contracts. However policy security is crucial for  all forms of energies and a long-term energy policy stability  is the basic fundament for all investments. However, a  diversified investment across regulatory jurisdictions,  geographies, and technologies can help mitigate those risks.  • Construction risks relate to the delayed or costly delivery of  an asset, the default of a contracting party, or an  engineering/design failure. Construction risks are less  prevalent for renewable energy projects because they have  relatively simple designs; however, construction risks can  be further mitigated by selecting high-quality and  experienced turnkey partners, using proven technologies  and established equipment suppliers, and agreeing on  retentions and construction guarantees  • Financing risks refer to the inadequate use of debt in the  financial structure of an asset. Examples include the  abusive use of leverage, exposure to interest rate volatility,  and the need to refinance at less favourable terms.  • Operational risks include equipment failure, counterparty  default, and reduced availability of the primary energy  source (such as wind, heat, and insolation). for renewable  assets, lower than forecast resource availability will result in  lower revenues and profitability, so this risk can  detrimentally impact the business case.    4.3 overcoming barriers to finance and  investment for renewable energy  Despite the relatively strong growth in renewable energies in  an increase number of countries, many barriers still hinder the  rapid uptake of renewable energy needed to achieve the  scale of development required. The key barriers to renewable  energy investment identified by Greenpeace in a literature  review2 and interviews with renewable energy sector  financiers and developers are shown in figure 4.4.  52    broad categories of common barriers to renewable energy  development are present in many countries; however, the  nature of the barriers differs significantly. At the local level,  political and policy support, grid infrastructure, electricity  markets and planning regulations have to be negotiated for  new projects.  In some regions, policy uncertainty holds back investment  more than any absence of policy support mechanisms. In the  short term, investors aren’t confident rules will remain  unaltered or that renewable energy goals will be met in the  longer term, let alone increased.  Investor caution about these risks drives up investment costs,  and the difficulty in accessing finance is a barrier for renewable  energy project developers. The contributing factors include a  lack of information and experience among investors and  project developers, involvement of smaller companies and  projects, and a high proportion of up-front costs.  Grid access and grid infrastructure is also a major barrier for  developers who, during project development, are not certain  they will be able to sell all the electricity they generate in  many countries.  In many regions, both state-owned and private utilities block  renewable energy with their market and political power,  specifically by maintaining the ‘status quo’ in the grid,  protecting electricity markets for centralised coal and nuclear  power, and lobbying against pro-renewable and climate  protection laws.  The sometimes higher cost of renewable relative to  competitors is still a barrier, though many are confident that it  will be overcome in the coming decades. The Special Report  on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change  Mitigation (SRREN) identifies cost as the most significant  barrier to investment;3 renewable energy will rely on policy  intervention by governments in order to be competitive for  some time, which creates additional risks for investors. It is  important to note though that in some regions of the world  specific renewable technologies are broadly competitive with  current market energy prices (such as onshore wind in  Europe and solar hot water heaters in China).  Concerns over planning and permit issues are significant,  though they vary significantly in their strength and nature  depending on the jurisdiction.    4.4 how to overcome investment barriers for  renewable energy  The Energy [R]evolution will require a mix of policy measures,  finance, grid, and development. These are dealt with  throughout this report, the policy measures in particular in  Chapter 13. In summary:  • Additional and improved policy support mechanisms for  renewable energy are needed in all countries and regions.  • building confidence in the existing policy mechanisms may  be just as important as making them stronger, particularly  in the short term.  • Improved policy mechanisms can also lower the cost of  finance, particularly by providing longer durations of  revenue support and increasing revenue certainty.4  • Access to finance can be increased by greater involvement  of governments and development banks in programs like  loan guarantees and green bonds as well as more active  private investors.  • Grid access and infrastructure needs to be improved  through investment in smart, decentralised grids.  • Lowering the cost of renewable energy technologies  directly will require industry development and boosted  research and development.  • A smoother pathway for renewable energy needs to be  established through planning and permit issues at the local level.  4.5 the first decade of renewable energy  financing  Worldwide, investments in renewable electricity and fuels  rose from uSD 45 billion in 2004 to uSD 270 billion in 2014.  but the growth was not constant. The peak was uSD 280  billion in 2011. but in 2012, this figure dropped slightly to  uSD 256 billion and to uSD 232 billion in 2013. One reason  was policy uncertainty in Europe and the united States along  with retroactive changes. This decrease did not, however,  reflect far lower global growth; rather, the cost of solar in  particular was plummeting. Indeed, though the cost of Pv  continued to drop, the total investment volume in renewables  grew by nearly a fifth in 2014.  for instance, investments in Pv dropped by more than a fifth  in 2013 compared to the previous year even though new  capacity installations grew by nearly a third. In 2014, four  more countries – especially in the developing world – began  building renewables in light of the falling costs.  The low risk involved in wind and solar power in particular –  which have no fuel costs – is increasingly attracting not only  commercial banks to the sector, but also pension funds,  insurance firms, and corporations outside the energy sector.  All of them are looking for stable, long-term returns.  Nonetheless, conventional financing models need to be  revised for renewables, which have a relatively high upfront  price tag compared to fossil and nuclear power generators.  Investment firms are coming up with new tools for this  purpose; they go by such names as sustainable yield bonds  and green bonds in the uS and renewable financing company  bonds in the uk. unconventional funding is also becoming  common, such as crowdfunding and community energy coops  (REN21-2014-b).5  4.5.1 investment by economic group (ren21 – 2015)6  Investments in renewables made in developing countries rose  only slightly year-over-year in 2014 by three percent, whereas  the growth in developing and emerging countries reached 36  percent, driven largely by China, brazil, and India. The share  of the developing and emerging world and global renewable  energy investments therefore reached a new all-time high of  49 percent in 2014, with China making up 63 percent of that  share, up only slightly from the previous year. but India’s  investments grew strongly by 14 percent in 2014. Likewise,  other countries in Asia/Oceania continue to post increasing  investments, up by nearly 9 percent in 2014 (REN21 2015).  In contrast, investments in Europe were flat that year and only  grew in the united States by seven percent. 2011 remains the  bumper year for renewable energy investments in these  regions. Outside of brazil and the united States, the  Americas posted 21 percent greater investments. The fastest  growth, however, came from the Middle East and Africa,  where 44 percent more was invested in 2014.  The top 10 list of countries by investment volume was fairly  balanced that year, consisting of four bRICS countries and  six developed countries. China made up a third of total  investments in first place, followed by the united States,  japan, the united kingdom, Germany, Canada, brazil, India,  the Netherlands, and South Africa.  In tenth place worldwide, South Africa was the leader in  Africa. It devoted roughly a third of its investments to wind  power in 2014, with just over two thirds going to  photovoltaics and CSP. The next largest renewable energy  investors in Africa were kenya, Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, and  Tanzania (REN21 – 2015).  references    4.5.2 financing models  In 2015, uNEP and bloomberg New Energy finance  produced an overview of the various methods of collecting  funds for renewable energy projects (uNEP-bloomberg NEf  2015). They include the following:  • venture capital and private equity (vC/Pe): venture capital and  private equity investments in grew by more than a quarter  and 2014 but still remained below the third of the record  set in 2008. The united States is still the leader in vC  renewable energy investments, whereas equity-raising  sector in Europe shrink significantly in 2014 (REN21-2015).  • Publicly quoted companies: This sector grew by 42 percent in  2014, making it four times larger than it was in 2012  (REN21-2015). After years of little activity, public markets  became interested in small-scale hydropower and ocean  energy in 2014. In return, interest in biofuels and biomass  dropped and disappeared almost entirely for geothermal,  where investments were privatized (REN21-2015).  • asset finance, which includes funds from equity, loans, and  corporate balance sheets (but excludes refinancings).  Asset financing of utility-scale projects made up 62 percent  of total investments in renewable energy in 2014, an  increase of 10 percent.  • mergers and acquisitions, where new corporate buyers take  over the existing equity and debt of companies developing  and/or operating renewable energy projects. These  investments shrank by five percent in 2014 as the  consolidation phase drew towards an end, both in the wind  and solar sectors.  funding devoted to research and development (R&D)  remained relatively flat in 2014, rising by only two percent.  This figure includes both governmental and corporate  budgets. for the fourth year in a row, more money was  invested in solar R&D than all other renewable energy sectors  combined. R&D investments in the wind sector fell last year,  while they rose slightly for solar at two percent. More funding  was devoted, however, to R&D for biofuels, biomass, and  ocean energy (REN21-2015). Europe remains a hotspot for  renewable energy R&D with more than a third of total  investments here – nearly as much as the united States and  China combined.  Small-scale distributed renewable energy projects continue  to make up a bigger share of the total, however, rising by a  third to 27 percent of total investments in 2014. Most of  these projects are rooftop photovoltaics (REN21-2015).    57  4.5.3 investment sources as of 2014  Clean energy funds and crowdfunding are the new kids on  the financing block. Issues of green bonds hit a record level  last year, especially due to a doubling of the volume among  development banks, such as the World bank and national  government agencies. for instance, brazil’s bNDES was the  leader in utility-scale asset financing, pushing the European  Investment bank into second place. Likewise, corporate  green energy bonds grew fivefold.  In 2014, two new South-South development banks were also  created: the New Development bank and the Asian  Infrastructure Investment bank. The five bRICS countries  each contributed uSD 10 billion to the former, which will go  into business in 2016 with a focus on infrastructure and  sustainable development. The latter brought together 23  Asian countries (not including japan and South korea). It is  expected to go into business in late 2015 with an initial  budget of uSD 50 billion, most of which came from China.  up to now, it has been commonly assumed that markets  would eventually drive renewable energy growth without  specific policy support when the cost of renewables is  competitive with conventional energy. Now that that point of  intersection is being reached, it is becoming clear that  policymakers will continue to play a role. As this chapter  illustrates, policy will still be needed to facilitate investments.  The electrification of the transport sector will also require  infrastructure decisions that governments can help make.  Likewise, renewable heating and cooling – where the public  will make investments as much as energy experts will –  requires both awareness-raising and incentives. finally, as  the share of renewable energy increases in power supply, the  focus will turn from the cost of a kilowatt-hour from a  generator towards overall system costs. Here, policymakers  will be needed to ensure that incumbents do not overly  protect their stranded investments.    s c e n a r i o f o r a f u t u r e e n e r gy s u P P ly  image hundreds of Millions of tonnes of sand and dust Particles are lifted froM north african deserts each year and carried across the atlantic ocean. dust Picked uP froM the  bodélé dePression in chad—farther inland than in the storM shown above—has rock Minerals loaded with PhosPhorus, an essential nutrient for Plant Proteins and growth. the  aMazon rainforest dePends on this dust to flourish because soil nutrients are in short suPPly in aMazonian soils.  scenario storylines and  main premises  scenario approach and  background studies  scenario regions main scenario assumptions  review: greenpeace scenario  projections of the past  only the most  agressive growth  projections such as  the greenpeace  scenarios has been  close to accurate”  “  © nasa earth observatory images by jesse allen  59  Moving from principles to action for energy supply that  mitigates against climate change requires a long-term  perspective. Energy infrastructure takes time to build up; new  energy technologies take time to develop. Policy shifts often  also need many years to take effect. In most world regions  the transformation from fossil to renewable energy will require  additional investment and higher supply costs over about  twenty years. However, there will be tremendous economic  benefits in the long term, due to much lower consumption of  increasingly expensive, rare or imported fuels. Any analysis  that seeks to tackle energy and environmental issues  therefore needs to look ahead at least until mid-century.  Scenarios are necessary to describe possible development  paths, to give decision-makers a broad overview and  indicate how far they can shape the future energy system.  Three scenarios are used here to show the wide range of  possible pathways in each world region for a future energy  supply system:  • a reference scenario, reflecting a continuation of current  trends and policies  • the energy [r]evolution scenario, designed to achieve a set of  environmental policy targets resulting in an optimistic but  still feasible pathway towards a widely decarbonised  energy system by 2050 in close relation to basic framework  assumptions of the Reference scenario  • the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, representing an  ambitious pathway towards a fully decarbonised energy  system already by 2050 with significant additional efforts  compared to the “basic” Energy [R]evolution scenario  5.1 scenario storylines and main premises  The reference scenario (ref) is based on the Current Policies  scenarios published by the International Energy Agency (IEA)  in World Energy Outlook 2014 (WEO 2014).1 It only takes into  account existing international energy and environmental  policies. Its assumptions include, for example, continuing  progress in electricity and gas market reforms, the  liberalisation of cross-border energy trade and recent policies  designed to combat environmental pollution. The Reference  scenario does not include additional policies to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions. As the IEA’s projections only  extend to 2040, they are extended by extrapolating their key  macroeconomic and energy indicators forward to 2050. This  provides a baseline for comparison with the Energy  [R]evolution scenarios. unlike the previous Reference  scenario of the Energy [R]evolution study published in 2012,  it includes an increase in population and new market trends  for renewable technologies.  The energy [r]evolution scenario (e[r]) is an update of the  Energy [R]evolution scenario published in 2012, which  followed the key target to reduce worldwide carbon dioxide  emissions from energy use down to a level of around 4  gigatonnes per year by 2050 in order to hold the increase in  global temperature under +2°C. A second objective is the  global phasing out of nuclear energy. The new Energy  [R]evolution scenario takes into account developments  between the former base year 2009 and the new base year  2012 as well as changes in the new Reference scenario  based on WEO 2014, which serves as the baseline for  additional measures assumed in the Energy [R]evolution. In  addition, pathways for the deployment of renewable energy  and efficiency measures are revised, reflecting technology  trends of the last few years and new estimations of worldwide  potentials and investment costs leading to partly different  technology mixes. furthermore, the possibilities to implement  new technologies by 2020 are now more limited than in 2012  due to the required development time of new power plants  and other infrastructures. following the basic assumptions of  the Reference scenario, these changes lead to higher peaks  in energy demand and fossil energy supply compared to the  Energy [R]evolution of 2012. In consequence, there is a lower  decarbonisation pathway if we keep at the previous scenario  approach of the Energy [R]evolution. Nevertheless the  scenario still includes significant efforts to fully exploit the  large potential for energy efficiency, using currently available  best-practice technology. At the same time, various proven  renewable energy sources are integrated to a large extent for  heat and electricity generation as well as the production of  biofuels and hydrogen. The general framework parameters for  population and GDP growth remain unchanged from the  Reference scenario.  The new advanced energy [r]evolution scenario (adv e[r])  needs much stronger efforts to transform the energy systems  of all world regions towards a 100% renewable energy supply.  The consumption pathways remain basically the same as in  the E[R]; however, a much faster introduction of new  technologies leads to a complete decarbonisation of the  power, heat and especially the transportation sector. The  latter requires a strong role of hydrogen and other synthetic  fuels complementary to battery electric vehicle concepts and  (limited) biofuels. Due to higher efficiencies of new vehicle  concepts and the assumption of much higher modal split  changes compared to the basic E[R] resulting final energy  demand for transportation is lower. However, this scenario  requires more fundamental changes of mobility patterns,  behaviour, and infrastructural needs to compensate for the  high energy losses associated to the production of synthetic  fuels based on renewable electricity. Also in the heating  sector, electricity and hydrogen play a larger role substituting  remaining fossil fuels. In the power sector, natural gas is  replaced by hydrogen as well. Therefore, electricity  generation increases significantly in this scenario, assuming  power from renewable energy sources to be the main  “primary energy” of the future.   5  The scenario building follows for both Energy [R]evolution  scenarios a framework of targets and main premises that  strongly influences the development of individual  technological and structural pathways for each region and  each sector. The main premises considered for this scenario  building process are described in the following.  • Strong efficiency improvements and the dynamic expansion  of renewable energy in all sectors are the main strategies to  meet the overall target of CO2 emission reductions. CCS  technologies are not implemented, and nuclear power and  lignite power plants are phased out quickly, followed by  hard coal power plants. In developing countries in  particular, a shorter operational lifetime for coal power  plants (20 instead of 35 years) is assumed in order to allow  a faster uptake of renewable energy. based on current  knowledge about potentials, costs and recent trends in  renewable energy deployment (see next section on  ‘Scenario approach and background studies’), a dynamic  further growth of capacities for renewable heat and power  generation is assumed.  • The global quantities of biomass power generators and  large hydro power remain limited in the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, for reasons of ecological sustainability. Wind  power and solar power (both photovoltaics and  concentrating solar power (CSP)) are expected to be the  main pillars of future power supply, complemented by  smaller contributions from geothermal (hydrothermal and  Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)), ocean energy and  the further expansion of small and medium sized hydro  power. The scenarios follow the strategy to limit the share  of fluctuating power generation and to maintain a sufficient  share of dispatchable, secured capacity. Therefore, power  generation from biomass and CSP but also a sufficient  share of gas-fired back-up capacities and storage are  important factors for the security of supply in future energy  systems.  • Global sustainable biomass potentials are assumed to be  limited to less than 100 Ej according to background  studies. Traditional biomass use is largely replaced by  state-of-the-art technologies, primarily highly efficient  cogeneration plants. In developing regions with a high  share of traditional biomass use an implementation of  improved cooking stoves is assumed. No biomass trade is  considered between world regions for the scenarios.  However, the large-scale import of electricity from CSP is a  promising option for some world regions, especially for  OECD Europe, where a net import of up to 400 to 600 TWh  per year from North Africa and the Middle East is assumed  in the scenarios. CSP implementation after 2030 is  assumed for all regions with a solar multiple of 3 and  thermal energy storage able to provide energy for 12 h per  day of full-load operation of the turbine.  • Efficiency savings in the transport sector are a result of fleet  penetration with new highly efficient vehicle concepts, such  as electric vehicles but also assumed changes in mobility  patterns and the implementation of efficiency measures for  combustion engines. Mobility demand is expected to  increase strongly in developing countries. The scenarios  assume a limited use of biofuels for transportation following  the latest scientific reports indicating that biofuels might  have a higher greenhouse gas emission footprint than fossil  fuels. There are no global sustainability standards for  biofuels yet, which would be needed to avoid deforestation  and competition with food crops.  • Efficiency in use of electricity and fuels in ‘industry’ and  ‘other sectors’ has been re-evaluated based on technical  efficiency potentials and energy intensities (see also next  section ‘Scenario approach and background studies’). A  consistent approach is used to layout feasible, rather  conservative pathways and result in converging specific  consumptions in all world regions. In consequence, specific  energy use for all applications and in all regions is assumed  to decrease significantly.  • Hydrogen generated by electrolysis using renewable  electricity is introduced as a third renewable fuel in the  transportation sector complementary to biofuels and the  direct use of renewable electricity. Hydrogen generation  can have high energy losses; however, the limited  potentials of biofuels and probably also battery electric  mobility makes it necessary to have a third renewable  option. Alternatively, this renewable hydrogen could be  converted into synthetic methane and liquid fuels  depending on economic benefits (storage costs vs.  additional losses) as well as technology and market  development in the transport sector (combustion engines  vs. fuel cells). The Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario  takes this strategy one step further, increasing the share of  electric and fuel cell vehicles. Additionally, renewable  hydrogen is converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which  replace the remaining fossil fuels, especially for heavy duty  vehicles and air transportation, albeit with low overall  efficiency of the synfuel system.  • The Energy [R]evolution scenarios also foresee a shift in  the heat sector towards an increasing direct use of  electricity, thanks to the enormous and diverse potential  for renewable power and the limited availability of  renewable fuels for high temperature process heat in  industry. In addition, a fast expansion of the use of district  heating and geothermal heat pumps is assumed, leading  to an increase in electricity demand, which partly offsets  the efficiency savings in these sectors. A faster expansion  of solar and geothermal heating systems is also assumed.  In the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario hydrogen  replaces 30-40% of the remaining gas consumption in  2040 and 100% in 2050 – not only for industry, but also for  power production in cogeneration and gas power stations,  providing back up capacities for variable power production  as from wind and Pv.  60    5  61  • The increasing shares of fluctuating renewable power  generation above all by wind farms and photovoltaics  require implicitly the implementation of smart grids and a  fast expansion of transmission grids, storage, and other  load balancing capacities. Other infrastructural needs result,  for instance, from an increasing role of district heating,  electric and hydrogen mobility and the generation and  distribution of synthetic fuels. In both Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, it is therefore implicitly assumed that such  infrastructural projects will be implemented in all regions  without serious societal, economic and political barriers.  • The scenarios only consider regional demand and supply  excluding bunker fuels for international marine shipping and  international air transportation. Today, 14% of all fossil  transport fuels are used for bunkers. In order to replace  bunker fuels entirely with renewables, a combination of  energy efficiency and renewable fuels is required. Largescale  biomass use for an additional biofuel generation is  possible within the limit of the assumed sustainable  biomass potential. However, it’s obvious, that - depending  on demand development – an additional large-scale  generation of synthetic liquid hydrocarbons is necessary for  a complete decarbonisation of bunker fuels. We estimate  this additional demand in the range of 7,000 to 9,000 Pj of  biofuels and synfuels, respectively. The latter would require  an additional generation of renewable electricity of about  5,000 to 6,000 TWh per year.  The Energy [R]evolution scenarios by no means claim to  predict the future; they simply describe and compare three  potential development pathways out of the broad range of  possible ‘futures’. The Energy [R]evolution scenarios are  designed to indicate the efforts and actions required to  achieve their ambitious targets and to illustrate the options  we have at hand to change our energy supply system into  one that is truly sustainable. They may serve as a consistent  basis for further analyses of possible ways and concepts to  implement the energy transition.  5.2 scenario approach and background studies  The Energy [R]evolution scenarios are target-oriented  scenarios. Therefore, they must not be interpreted as a  “forecast” of the future development of the energy systems.  The scenarios are developed using a primarily “bottom-up”  approach (technology-driven). Assumed growth rates for  population, GDP, specific energy demand and the  deployment of renewable energy technology are important  drivers. Quantified targets for transforming the energy  systems set the framework for their design. The supply  scenarios were calculated using the Mesap/PlaNet simulation  model adopted in the previous Energy [R]evolution studies.2  This model does not use a cost optimization approach for the  calculation of energy technology expansion rather it requires  a consistent exogenous definition of feasible developments in  order to meet the targets. using assumptions and  background information about technical and structural  options for the transformation of the energy system, and  taking into account – as far as possible – possible barriers  and limits, consistent development paths are defined and  integrated into the model database. The model as accounting  framework then calculates the energy balances of the future  for all sectors as well as related investments and costs in the  power sector.  The scenarios in this report were commissioned by  Greenpeace from the Systems Analysis group of the Institute  of Engineering Thermodynamics, part of the German  Aerospace Center (DLR). The Energy [R]evolution scenarios  are based on a series of studies developed for previous  Energy [R]evolution versions that are – unless otherwise noted  – described in detail in the Energy [R]evolution study of 2012.3  Structure and initial parametrization of the energy system for  each world region are extracted from the extended energy  balances published in 2014 by International Energy Agency  (IEA) (‘Energy balances of non-OECD countries’ and ‘Energy  balances of OECD countries’). The Reference scenario and  related specific data – such as efficiencies, load factors and  demand intensities – are based on the Current Policies  scenario published by the IEA in World Energy Outlook 2014.  The energy demand projections for the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios are also based on a study from the university of  utrecht, Netherlands, analysing the future potential for energy  efficiency measures for the Energy [R]evolution 2012 (Graus  2012).4 New insights on energy demand in developing  countries, for instance for Africa from the WEO 2014, and  new assumptions about living standards, energy savings and  possible rebound effects are included as well.  The biomass potential calculated for previous editions,  judged according to Greenpeace sustainability criteria, has  been developed by the German biomass Research Centre in  20095 and has been further reduced for precautionary  principles. The dynamic expansion of renewable energy  defined in the scenarios is based on recent technology  trends,6 current knowledge about regional renewable energy  potentials and costs for their deployment7 and market  development projections of the renewable energy industry.8    The future development pathway for cars and other  transportation technologies is based on a special report  produced in 2012 by the Institute of vehicle Concepts, DLR for  Greenpeace International (DLR 2012).9 The aim was to produce  a demanding but feasible scenario to lower global CO2  emissions from transport in keeping with the overall targets.  The approach takes into account a vast range of technical  measures to reduce the energy consumption of vehicles, but  also considers the dramatic increase in vehicle ownership and  annual mileage taking place in developing countries. The major  parameters are vehicle technology, alternative fuels, changes  in sales of different vehicle sizes of light duty vehicles (called  the segment split) and changes in tonne-kilometres and  vehicle-kilometres travelled (described as modal split). The  Institute carried out new technical research for Greenpeace in  early 2015, focusing on the latest developments of land-based  transport systems, especially for megacities (DLR 2015).10  Assumptions for fossil fuel resources and planned and ongoing  investments in coal, gas and oil on a global and regional basis  are based on a study by the Ludwig bölkow System Technik  Institute, commissioned by Greenpeace for the Energy  [R]evolution study of 2012. Technology and cost projections for  the heating sector are adopted from a background study  commissioned by EREC from DLR about the current renewable  heating technology markets, market forecasts, cost projections  and state of the technology development. Details can be found  as well in the Energy [R]evolution study of 2012.  5.3 scenario regions  To develop a global energy scenario requires a model that  reflects the significant structural differences between different  countries’ energy supply systems. The International Energy  Agency breakdown of ten world regions, as used in the ongoing  series of World Energy Outlook reports, has been  chosen because the IEA also provides the most  comprehensive global energy statistic11. This scenario edition  maintains the ten regions approach. The countries in each of  the world regions are listed in Table 5.1.    Regional specifics play an important role for the layout of the  scenario pathways.  The oeCd europe region includes countries with quite different  energy supply systems, potentials of renewable energy sources,  as well as power and heat demand patterns. High solar  potentials and low heat demand for buildings are characteristic  for the south. The northern and western parts of Europe have  high wind potentials, especially wind offshore. In northern and  central Europe we find high potentials for hydro power and a  high energy demand for space heating (as in eastern Europe).  biomass potentials exist predominantly in the north and east  and are limited above all in the southern regions. Industrial  demand for electricity and process heat is quite different in  highly industrialized countries such as Scandinavian countries,  Germany or france compared to some eastern and southern  countries. In most European countries we already have policies  and market mechanisms for the implementation of renewable  energy, above all in the Eu member countries. The European  Network of Transmission System Operators (entso-e) can serve  as a well-established basis for the further development of an  interconnected European grid, which would be able to  implement large-scale and long-range transmission of  renewable power to demand centres. This may lead as well to  important interconnections to the Middle East/North Africa  region and Eastern Europe/Eurasia.  The energy system in oeCd north america – uS, Canada, and  Mexico – is dominated by developments in the uS, where  more than 80% of the region’s demand occurs. In the highly  developed countries of the uS and Canada, reduction of  specific energy demand through higher efficiency plays a  crucial role for the decarbonisation of OECD North America’s  energy system. In Mexico, in contrast, increasing living  standards and increasing population will result in increasing  demand, despite ambitious increases in efficiency. The high  potentials for concentrating solar power (CSP) in Mexico and  the uS will allow for the large-scale use of CSP plants for grid  balancing and grid stabilization, reducing the demand for  power storages, demand side management and other  balancing options compared to other world regions. In the  large metropolitan areas in these countries, electromobility  and hydrogen cars will penetrate into the market earlier and  at a faster pace than in most other world regions.  oeCd asia oceania consists of two islands – japan and New  zealand – the peninsula South korea and the continent of  Australia. This world region is dominated by the high energy  demand in japan, which has rather limited renewable energy  resources. The lack of physical grid connections prevents power  transmission between these countries. Thus it is a huge effort to  supply the large japanese nation with renewable energy, and  stabilize the fluctuating wind power, without tapping the large  solar potential in other countries such as Australia. Hydrogen  and synfuels here not only serve for long-term storage of  renewable power, but also as an option for balancing renewable  energy supply across borders. An early market introduction of  fuel cell cars in japan may support such a strategy.  The region eastern europe/eurasia includes some Eu member  countries of the East that are not part of the OECD, some  other countries of the former yugoslav Republic and several  countries of the former Soviet union. However, it is  dominated by the economy and energy system of Russia. The  main energy carrier of today is natural gas followed by oil.  The region has large energy resources regarding biomass and  wind power but also geothermal energy and photovoltaics.  Eastern Europe/Eurasia is the only world region that may face  a significant population decrease due to the expected  demographic development above all in Russia.  latin america is dominated by the energy system of brazil,  which accounts for around half of the energy demand. Latin  America has the highest urbanization rate of all non-OECD  regions, providing opportunities for a large-scale electrification  of heat and transport sectors based on renewable resources.  biomass potentials in Latin America are high and available for  biofuel production. Particularly brazil already has a long history  of biofuel cars on the market. Latin America has also high  potentials for photovoltaics and concentrating solar power  plants (CSP). According to the WEO 2014 Electricity  database,16 Latin America has a national electrification rate of  95% and an average of 82% in rural areas (year 2012). The  WEO 2014 biomass database17 shows that a population of 68  million still relied on traditional use of biomass for cooking.  the middle east consists of a series of oil dependent countries,  that all share a tremendous solar potential. Transport demand  in the Middle East is very high. One reason is the lack of  regional rail transportation. There is a high rate of electricity  access in urban areas, where currently almost 70% of the fast  growing population lives (WEO 2014). Thus, electrification of  transport is a main target in the Energy [R]evolution scenarios.  for many of the Middle East countries, water scarcity is a  problem. Here opportunities arise to combine large  concentrating solar power plants with water desalination,  reducing pressure on the water supply systems.  africa is a very heterogeneous region, united only by a very fast  population growth. It combines arid northern Africa,  underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa, and the emerging energy  market of South Africa. Northern Africa features a high  electrification rate, high CSP potential and water scarcity. Sub-  Saharan Africa is characterized by a low urbanization and a lack  of access to electricity for two-thirds of its people (WEO 2014).  The dependency on traditional biomass use is strong, with over  700 million people relying on fuel wood or charcoal for cooking in  inefficient cooking stoves or open fires, with an efficiency of 10-  20%. An introduction of efficient technologies will scarcely reduce  absolute energy demand but will increase living standards. The  picture is somewhat different in South Africa, featuring a coal-based  energy system and a comparatively stable and well  connected electricity grid, with access to electricity for already  more than 85% of its population in 2012 (WEO 2014).    india has a fast-growing population of over 1.2 billion people  and is the seventh-largest country by area. However,  population density is already 2.7 times higher than in China.  Due to its climate, India has a rather limited CSP potential.  Wind power potential is expected to be limited due to land  use constraints; however, a large technical potential can be  estimated from available meteorological data. According to  the WEO 2014 database, electricity access is on average  75%, with 94% in urban areas and 67% in rural areas. In  India, about 815 million people still relied on the traditional  use of biomass for cooking in 2012. Due to population and  GDP growth, increasing living standards, and mobility, it is  expected that final energy demand in India will further  increase significantly, although large potentials for efficiency  savings exist.  China has large potentials for renewable energy resources,  especially for solar thermal power generation in the west,  wind onshore in the north and wind offshore in the east and  southeast. Photovoltaic power generation could play an  important role throughout all regions. Expansion of  hydropower generation is currently also seen a major  strategy; however, potentials for small hydro are rather low.  China will face further large increases in energy demand in all  sectors of the energy system. Chinese economic prosperity  has been underpinned mainly by coal, which provides over  two-thirds of China’s primary energy supply today (IEA WEO  2014). The increase in electricity use due to higher  electrification rates will be a major factor for the successful  expansion of renewable energy in the industry, buildings and  transportation sectors. In China, nearly all households are  connected to the electricity grid. but according to WEO  2014, about 450 million Chinese still relied on the traditional  use of biomass for cooking in 2012. China has pledged to  curtail CO2 emissions before 2030 and has already some  ambitious political targets for renewable energy deployment.  The other asia region includes all developing countries of Asia  except China and India. This group covers a large spectrum in  terms of size, economy, stability, development status and a  large spread geographically from the Arabian Sea into the  Pacific. Electricity access is quite different in these countries  as well according to WEO 2014. In southeast Asia, we find an  average access of 77 %, with only one third of population in  Myanmar and Cambodia and nearly 100% access in  Singapore, Thailand and vietnam. In Indonesia, we find 76%  (92% in urban areas), in bangladesh 60% (90%), and in  Pakistan 69% (88%). In southeast Asia, 46% of the population  still relies on traditional biomass use with the highest shares in  Myanmar (93%) and Cambodia (89%). In Indonesia, 42%, in  bangladesh 89% and in Pakistan 62% still used biomass for  cooking in 2012. The lowest values can be found in Singapore  (0%), Malaysia (0%) and Thailand (24%). The scenarios thus  cover the whole band width of renewable sources and  technological development, even though the outlook for each  country might deviate largely from the average.  5.4 main scenario assumptions  5.4.1 population development  future population development is an important factor in  energy scenario building because population size affects the  size and composition of energy demand, directly and through  its impact on economic growth and development. The IEA  World Energy Outlook 2014 uses the united Nations  Development Programme (uNDP) projections for population  development. for this study the same population projections  from uNDP up to 2050 are applied.18  Table 5.2 shows that, based on uNEP World Population  Prospect 2012 (medium fertility variant), the world’s  population is expected to grow by 0.8 % per year on average  over the period 2015 to 2050, from 7.3 billion people in 2009  to nearly 9.5 billion by 2050. The rate of population growth  will slow over the projection period, from 1.1% per year  during 2012-2020 to 0.6% per year during 2040-2050. The  updated projections show an increase in population  estimates by 2050 of around 250 million compared to the  uNDP 2010 edition, which was used for the Energy  [R]evolution 2012. from a regional perspective, the  population of the developing regions will continue to grow  most rapidly. The region Eastern Europe/Eurasia will face a  continuous decline (7% in total between 2012 and 2050),  followed after a short while by the OECD Asia Oceania  countries and also China. The population in OECD Europe  and OECD North America are expected to increase through  2050. The share of the population living in today’s non-OECD  countries will increase from the current 82% to 85% in 2050.  China’s contribution to world population will drop from 20%  today to 15% in 2050. Africa will remain the region with the  highest growth rate, leading to a share of 25% of world  population in 2050.  Satisfying the energy needs of a growing population in the  developing regions of the world in an environmentally friendly  manner is the fundamental challenge to achieve a global  sustainable energy supply.  64    5  65  5.4.2 economic growth  Economic growth is a key driver for energy demand. Since  1971, each 1% increase in global Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) has been accompanied by a 0.6% increase in primary  energy consumption. The decoupling of energy demand and  GDP growth is therefore a prerequisite for an Energy  [R]evolution. Most global energy/economic/environmental  models constructed in the past have relied on market  exchange rates to place countries in a common currency for  estimation and calibration. This approach has been the  subject of considerable discussion in recent years, and an  alternative has been proposed in the form of purchasing  power parity (PPP) exchange rates. Purchasing power  parities compare the costs in different currencies of a fixed  basket of traded and non-traded goods and services and  yield a widely-based measure of the standard of living. This is  important in analysing the main drivers of energy demand or  for comparing energy intensities among countries.  Although PPP assessments are still relatively imprecise  compared to statistics based on national income and product  trade and national price indexes, they are considered to  provide a better basis for global scenario development.19  Thus all data on economic development in WEO 2014 refers  to purchasing power adjusted GDP. However, as WEO 2014  only covers the time period up to 2040 projections for 2040-  2050 for the Energy [R]evolution scenarios are based on our  own estimates.  Prospects for GDP growth have decreased considerably  since the previous study, due to the financial crisis at the  beginning of 2009, although underlying growth trends  continue much the same. GDP growth in all regions is  expected to slow gradually over the coming decades. World  GDP is assumed to grow on average by 3.4% per year over  the period 2012-2040. China and India are expected to grow  faster than other regions, followed by the Middle East, Africa,  other non-OECD Asia, and Eastern Europe/Eurasia. The  growth of the Chinese economy will slow as it becomes more  mature, but it will nonetheless become the largest in the  world in PPP terms by 2030. GDP in OECD Europe and  OECD Asia Oceania is assumed to grow by around 1.5% and  1.3% per year over the projection period, while economic  growth in OECD North America is expected to be slightly  higher. The OECD share of global PPP-adjusted GDP will  decrease from 53% in 2012 to 32% in 2050.    5.4.3 oil and gas price projections  The recent dramatic fluctuations in global oil prices have  been significant and with influence on price projections.  under the 2004 ‘high oil and gas price’ scenario from the  European Commission, for example, an oil price of just  $34 per barrel was assumed in 2030. More recent projections  of oil prices by 2040 in the IEA’s WEO 2014 range from  $2013100/bbl in the 450 ppm scenario up to $2013155/bbl in the  Current Policies scenario.  Since the first Energy [R]evolution study was published in  2007, the actual price of oil has moved over $100/bbl for the  first time, and in july 2008 reached a record high of more  than $140/bbl. Oil prices then fell back to $100/bbl in  September 2008 and around $80/bbl in April 2010, but  afterwards again increased to more than $110/bbl in early  2012. beginning in 2014, oil prices plummeted to values  between 40 and 60 $/bbl in 2015 due to the global economic  situation and market reasons. Taking into account expected  growth in global energy demand in mid-term and long-term  projections, the 2015 revision of the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios assumed fossil fuel price projections according to  the World Energy Outlook 2014. In contrast to the previous  Energy [R]evolution editions, the result is different  assumptions for the Reference scenario compared to the  Energy [R]evolution scenarios.  As the supply of natural gas is limited by the availability of  pipeline infrastructure, there is no world market price for gas.  In most regions of the world the gas price is directly tied to  the price of oil.    5.4.4 cost projections for efficient fossil fuel  generation and carbon capture and storage (ccs)  and co2 emissions  Specific investment and operation costs of coal, gas, lignite  and oil power plants are assumed according to WEO 2014  Special report on investments.20 because they are at an  advanced stage of technology and market development, the  potential for cost reductions is limited.  There is much speculation about the potential for carbon  capture and storage (CCS) to mitigate the effect of fossil fuel  consumption on climate change, even though the technology  is still under development. Assumptions about costs,  effectiveness and environmental effects of CCS are highly  speculative, therefore CCS power plants are not included in  the Energy [R]evolution analysis. More details can be found in  the previous Energy [R]evolution edition of 2012.  Prospects for establishing an effective global carbon emissions  trading system across all world regions are currently at best  unclear. In contrast to the previous Energy [R]evolution  scenario, the 2015 revision sets aside CO2 pricing altogether.  Cost comparisons between the scenarios thus only rely on  investment, operation & maintenance and fuel costs.  Table 5.5 summarises our assumptions on the technical and  economic parameters of future fossil-fuelled power plant  technologies. based on estimates from WEO 2014, we  assume that further technical innovation will not prevent an  increase of future investment costs because raw material  costs and technical complexity will continue to increase.  Also, improvements in power plant efficiency are outweighed  by the expected increase in fossil fuel prices, in which would  make electricity generation costs increase significantly.  5.4.5 cost projections for renewable energy  technologies  The different renewable energy technologies available today all  have different technical maturity, costs and development potential.  Whereas hydro power has been widely used for decades, other  technologies, such as the gasification of biomass or ocean  energy, have yet to find their way to market maturity. Some  renewable sources by their very nature, including wind and solar  power, provide a variable supply, requiring a revised coordination  with the grid network. but although in many cases renewable  energy technologies are ‘distributed’ - their output being  generated and delivered locally to the consumer – in the future we  can also have large-scale applications like offshore wind parks,  photovoltaic power plants or concentrating solar power stations.    It is possible to develop a wide spectrum of options to market  maturity, using the individual advantages of the different  technologies, linking them with each other, and integrating  them step by step into the existing supply structures. This  approach will provide a complementary portfolio of  environmentally friendly technologies for heat and power  supply and the provision of transport fuels.  Many of the renewable technologies employed today are at a  relatively early stage of market development. As a result, the  costs of electricity, heat and fuel production are generally  higher than those of competing conventional systems - a  reminder that the environmental and social costs of  conventional power production are not reflected in market  prices. It is expected, however that large cost reductions can  come from technical advances, manufacturing improvements  and large-scale production, unlike conventional technologies.  The dynamic trend of cost developments over time plays a  crucial role in identifying economically sensible expansion  strategies for scenarios spanning several decades.  To identify long-term cost developments, learning curves have  been applied to the model calculations to reflect the how cost  of a particular technology change in relation to the cumulative  production volumes. for many technologies, the learning  factor (or progress ratio) is between 0.75 for less mature  systems to 0.95 and higher for well-established technologies.  A learning factor of 0.9 means that costs are expected to fall  by 10% every time the cumulative output from the technology  doubles. Empirical data shows, for example, that the learning  factor for Pv solar modules has been fairly constant at 0.8  over 30 years whilst that for wind energy varies from 0.75 in  the uk to 0.94 in the German market.  Assumptions on future costs for renewable electricity  technologies in the Energy [R]evolution scenario of 2012 were  derived from a review of learning curve studies, for example  by Lena Neij,21 from the analysis of technology foresight and  road mapping studies, including the European Commission  funded NEEDS project (New Energy Externalities  Developments for Sustainability)22 or the IEA Energy  Technology Perspectives 2008, projections by the European  Renewable Energy Council published in April 2010 (“Re-  Thinking 2050”) and discussions with experts from different  sectors of the renewable energy industry. for the new Energy  [R]evolution, cost decreases due to recent market  developments are taken into account, leading to changes in  own cost assumptions above all for photovoltaics and solar  thermal power plants (including heat storages). However, for  the reason of consistency, region-specific cost assumptions  from WEO 2014 are adopted for biomass power plants,  hydro, wind power and ocean energy. The following tables  exemplarily show data used for the region OECD Europe.  photovoltaics  The worldwide photovoltaics (Pv) market has been growing at  25% per annum in recent years, reaching 40 GW of new  installed capacity in 201423 and is starting to make a  significant contribution to electricity generation. Photovoltaics  are important because of its decentralised/centralised  character, its flexibility for use in an urban environment and  huge potential for cost reduction. The Pv industry has been  increasingly exploiting this potential during the last few years,  with installation prices more than halving in the last few years.  Current development is focused on improving existing  modules and system components by increasing their energy  efficiency and reducing material usage. Technologies like Pv  thin film (using alternative semiconductor materials) or dye  sensitive solar cells are developing quickly and present a huge  potential for cost reduction. The mature technology crystalline  silicon, with a proven lifetime of 30 years, is continually  increasing its cell and module efficiency (by 0.5% annually),  whereas the cell thickness is rapidly decreasing (from 230 to  180 microns over the last five years). Commercial module  efficiency varies from 14 to 21%, depending on silicon quality  and fabrication process.  The learning factor for Pv modules has been fairly constant  over the last 30 years with costs reducing by 20% each time  the installed capacity doubles, indicating a high rate of  technical learning. Assuming a globally installed capacity of  5,000 to 7,000 GW between 2040 and 2050 in the Energy  [R]evolution scenario, and with an electricity output of 7,000  to 10,000 TWh/a, we can expect that generation costs of  around 4-7 cents/kWh (depending on the region) will be  achieved. Pv has already become competitive with retail  electricity prices in some parts of the world, and will become  competitive with fossil fuel costs soon.    concentrating solar power (csp)  ‘Concentrating’ solar thermal power stations can only use  direct sunlight and therefore depend on very sunny locations.  North Africa, for example, has a technical potential for this  technology which far exceeds local demand. The various solar  thermal technologies (detailed in Chapter 10) have good  prospects for further development and cost reductions.  because of their more simple design, ‘fresnel’ collectors are  considered as an option for additional cost trimming. The  efficiency of central receiver systems can be increased by  producing compressed air at a temperature of up to 1,000 C°,  which is then used to run a combined gas and steam turbine.  Thermal storage systems are a way for CSP electricity  generators to reduce costs and to provide flexible and  dispatchable capacity. The Spanish Andasol 1 plant, for  example, is equipped with molten salt storage with a capacity  of 7.5 hours. A higher level of full load operation can be  realised by using a thermal storage system and a larger  collector field. Although this leads to higher investment costs,  it reduces the cost of electricity generation.  Depending on the level of irradiation and mode of operation,  it is expected that long term future electricity generation  costs of 7-10 cents/kWh can be achieved. This presupposes  rapid market introduction in the next few years.  wind power  Within a short period of time, the dynamic development of  wind power has resulted in the establishment of a flourishing  global market of over 50 GW in 2014.24 In Europe, favourable  policy incentives were the early drivers for the global wind  market. However, since 2009 more than three quarters of the  annual capacity installed was outside Europe and this trend is  likely to continue. The boom in demand for wind power  technology has nonetheless led to supply constraints and  stagnating markets. As a consequence, the cost of new  systems has increased. The industry is continuously  expanding production capacity, however, so it is already  resolving the bottlenecks in the supply chain and in 2014  market development again gained speed and increased by 6-  10 GW compared to the years before. Taking into account  market development projections, learning curve analysis and  industry expectations, investment costs for wind turbines are  reduced in the scenario by 13% for onshore and 47% for  offshore installations up to 2050.  biomass  The crucial factor for the economics of using biomass for  energy is the cost of the feedstock, which today ranges from  a negative for waste wood (based on credit for waste  disposal costs avoided) through inexpensive residual  materials to the more expensive energy crops. The resulting  spectrum of energy generation costs is correspondingly  broad. One of the most economic options is the use of waste  wood in steam turbine combined heat and power (CHP)  plants. Gasification of solid biomass, on the other hand,  which has a wide range of applications, is still relatively  expensive. In the long term it is expected that using wood  gas both in micro CHP units (engines and fuel cells) and in  gas-and-steam power plants will have the most favourable  electricity production costs. Converting crops into ethanol  and ‘bio diesel’ made from rapeseed methyl ester (RME) has  become increasingly important in recent years, for example in  brazil, the uSA and Europe – although its climate benefit is  disputed. Processes for obtaining synthetic fuels from  biogenic synthesis gases will also play a larger role.    A large potential for exploiting modern technologies exists in  Latin and North America, Europe and Eastern Europe/Eurasia,  either in stationary appliances or the transport sector. In the  long term, Europe and Eastern Europe/Eurasia could realise  20-50% of the potential for biomass from energy crops, whilst  biomass use in all the other regions will have to rely on forest  residues, industrial wood waste and straw. In Latin America,  North America and Africa in particular an increasing residue  potential will be available.  In other regions, such as the Middle East and all Asian  regions, increased use of biomass is restricted, either due to  a generally low availability or already high traditional use. for  the latter, using modern, more efficient technologies will  improve the sustainability of current usage and have positive  side effects, such as reducing indoor pollution and the heavy  workloads currently associated with traditional biomass use.  geothermal  Geothermal energy has long been used worldwide for  supplying heat, and since the beginning of the last century for  electricity generation. Geothermally generated electricity was  previously limited to sites with specific geological conditions,  but further intensive research and development work widened  potential sites. In particular the creation of large underground  heat exchange surfaces - Enhanced Geothermal Systems  (EGS) - and the improvement of low temperature power  conversion, for example with the Organic Rankine Cycle,  could make it possible to produce geothermal electricity  anywhere. Advanced heat and power cogeneration plants will  also improve the economics of geothermal electricity.  A large part of the costs for a geothermal power plant come  from deep underground drilling, so further development of  innovative drilling technology is expected. Assuming a global  average market growth for geothermal power capacity  increasing to 30% per year after 2020, adjusting to 14%  beyond 2030, the result would be a cost reduction potential  of more than 60% by 2050:  • for conventional geothermal power, from 15 cents/kWh to  about 9 cents/kWh;  • for EGS, despite the presently high figures (about 20  cents/kWh), electricity production costs - depending on the  payments for heat supply - are expected to come down to  around 8 cents/kWh in the long term.  because of its non-fluctuating supply and flexibility of  operation, geothermal energy could be a key element in a  future supply structure based on renewable sources. up to  now we have only used a marginal part of the potential.  Shallow geothermal drilling, for example, can deliver of  heating at any time anywhere, and can be used for thermal  energy storage.  ocean energy  Ocean energy, particularly offshore wave energy, is a  significant resource, and has the potential to satisfy an  important percentage of electricity supply worldwide.  Globally, the potential of ocean energy has been estimated at  around 90,000 TWh/year. The most significant advantages  are the vast availability and high predictability of the resource  and a technology with very low visual impact and no CO2  emissions. Many different concepts and devices have been  developed, including taking energy from the tides, waves,  currents and both thermal and saline gradient resources.  Many of these are in an advanced phase of research &  development, large scale prototypes have been deployed in  real sea conditions and some have reached pre-market  deployment. There are a few grid connected, fully operational  commercial wave and tidal generating plants.  The cost of energy from initial tidal and wave energy farms  has been estimated to be in the range of 20-80 €cents/kWh,25  70    and for initial tidal stream farms in the range of  11-22 €cents/kWh with significant learning prospects. key  areas for development will include concept design,  optimisation of the device configuration, reduction of capital  costs by exploring the use of alternative structural materials,  economies of scale and learning from operation. According to  the latest research findings, the learning factor is estimated to  be 10-15% for offshore wave and 5-10% for tidal stream. In the  long term, ocean energy has the potential to become one of  the most competitive and cost effective forms of generation. In  the next few years a dynamic market penetration is expected,  following a similar curve to wind energy.  because of the early development stage any future cost  estimates for ocean energy systems are uncertain.  hydropower  Hydropower is a mature technology with a significant part of its  global resource already exploited. There is still, however, some  potential left both for new schemes (especially small scale runof-  river projects with little or no reservoir impoundment) and for  repowering of existing sites. There is likely to be some more  potential for hydropower with the increasing need for flood  control and the maintenance of water supply during dry  periods. Sustainable hydropower makes an effort to integrate  plants with river ecosystems while reconciling ecology with  economically attractive power generation.  summary of renewable energy cost development  figure 5.1 summarises the cost trends for renewable power  technologies derived from the assumptions discussed above.  It is important to note that the expected cost reduction is not  a function of time, but of cumulative capacity (production of  units), so dynamic market development is required.  Reduced investment costs for renewable energy technologies  lead directly to lower heat and electricity generation costs, as  shown in figure 5.2. In the long term, full costs are expected  to converge at around 5 to 9 €cents/kWh (6-12 $cents/kWh),  except for biomass with about 12 €cents/kWh (15  $cents/kWh, calculated without heat credits for CHP). These  estimates depend on site-specific conditions such as the  local wind regime or solar irradiation, the availability of  biomass at reasonable prices or the credit granted for heat  supply in the case of combined heat and power generation.    5.4.6 cost projections for renewable heating  technologies  Renewable heating has the longest tradition of all renewable  technologies. for the previous Energy [R]evolution report  2012 EREC and DLR carried out a joint survey on costs of  renewable heating technologies in Europe. The report  analysed installation costs of renewable heating  technologies, ranging from direct solar collector systems to  geothermal and ambient heat applications and biomass  technologies. Some technologies are already mature and  compete on the market – especially simple heating systems  in the domestic sector. However, more sophisticated  technologies, which can provide higher shares of heat  demand from renewable sources, are still under development  and rather expensive. Market barriers slow down the further  implementation and cost reduction of renewable heating  systems, especially for heating networks. Nevertheless,  significant learning rates can be expected if renewable  heating is increasingly implemented as projected in the  Energy [R]evolution scenario.  solar thermal technologies  Solar collectors depend on direct solar irradiation, so the  yield strongly depends on the location. In very sunny regions,  simple thermosiphon systems can provide total hot water  demand in households at around 400 €/m2 installation costs.  In regions with less sun, where additional space heating is  needed, installation cost for pumped systems are twice as  high. In these areas, economies of scales can decrease solar  heating costs significantly. Large scale solar collector system  are known from 250-600 €/m2, depending on the share of  solar energy in the whole heating system and the level of  storage required.  deep geothermal applications  (Deep) geothermal heat from aquifers or reservoirs can be  used directly in hydrothermal heating plants to supply heat  demand close to the plant or in a district heating network for  several different types of heat (see Chapter 10). Due to the  high drilling costs deep geothermal energy is mostly feasibly  for large applications in combination with heat networks. It is  already economic feasible and in use for a long time, where  aquifers can be found near the surface, e.g. in the Pacific  Island or along the Pacific Ring of fire. Also in Europe deep  geothermal applications are being developed for heating  purposes at investment costs from 500€/kWth (shallow) to  3000 €/kWth (deep), with the costs strongly dependent on the  drilling depth.  heat pumps  Heat pumps typically provide hot water or space heat for  heating systems with relatively low supply temperature or can  serve as a supplement to other heating technologies. They  have become increasingly popular for underfloor heating in  buildings. Economies of scale are less important than for  deep geothermal, so there is focus on small household  applications with investment costs from 500-1,600 €/kW for  ground water systems and higher costs from  1,200-3,000 €/kW for ground source or aerothermal systems.  biomass applications  There is broad portfolio of modern technologies for heat  production from biomass, ranging from small scale single  room stoves to heating or CHP-plants in MW scale.  Investment costs show a similar variety: simple log wood  stoves can be obtained from 100 €/kW, more sophisticated  automated heating systems that cover the whole heat  demand of a building are significantly more expensive. Log  wood or pellet boilers range from 400-1,200 €/kW, with large  applications being cheaper than small systems.  Economy of scales apply to heating plants above 500 kW,  with investment cost between 400-700 €/kW. Heating plants  can deliver process heat or provide whole neighbourhoods  with heat. Even if heat networks demand additional  investment, there is great potential to use solid biomass for  heat generation in both small and large heating centres linked  to local heating networks.  Heat from cogeneration (CHP) is another option with a broad  range of technologies at hand. It is a very varied energy  technology – applying to co-firing in large coal-fired  cogeneration plants; biomass gasification combined with  CHP or biogas from wet residues. but the costs for heat are  often mainly dependent on the power production.  Main biomass input into renewable heating today is solid  biomass – wood in various specifications from waste wood  and residues to pellets from short rotation forestry. biomass  costs are as versatile: In Europe biomass costs ranged from  1-6 €/Gj for sawmill products, over 2-7 €/Gj for log wood to  6-18 €/Gj for wood pellets.26  Cost reductions expected vary strongly within each technology  sector, depending on the maturity of a specific technology. E.g.  small wood stoves will not see significant cost reductions,  while there is still learning potential for automated pellet  heating systems. Cost for simple solar collectors for swimming  pools might be already optimized, whereas integration in large  systems is neither technological nor economical mature. Table  5.13 shows average development pathways for a variety of  heat technology options.  72    5  73  5.4.7 assumptions for hydrogen and synfuel  production from renewable electricity  In the Energy [R]evolution scenarios hydrogen is introduced  as a substitute for natural gas with significant shares after  2030. Hydrogen is assumed to be produced via electrolysis,  resulting in an additional electricity demand fully supplied by  extra renewable power production capacities mainly from  wind, Pv and CSP.  Renewable hydrogen is essential in the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios for a variety of sectors:  In the power sector hydrogen replaces natural gas in gas  power plants with increasing shares after 2030, totally  replacing natural gas in the Advanced Energy [R]evolution  scenario by 2050. It thus serves as backup for fluctuating  electricity production from wind and Pv, securing electricity  supply at all times.  for the industry sector, hydrogen serves as an additional  renewable fuel option for high-temperature applications,  supplementing biomass in industrial processes, whenever  direct use of renewable electricity is not applicable. In the  Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario, hydrogen totally  replaces the remaining gas demand by 2050.  The transport sector also increasingly relies on hydrogen as a  renewable fuel, where battery supported electric vehicles  reach their limitations and where limited biomass potentials  restrict the extension of biofuel use. However, future  application of hydrogen might not suffice to replace all fossil  fuel demand, especially in aviation, heavy duty vehicles and  navigation. Thus the new Energy [R]evolution study  introduces synthetic hydrocarbons from renewable hydrogen,  electricity and biogenic/atmospheric CO2. These synfuels are  introduced after 2030 in the Advanced Energy [R]evolution  scenario. They provide for the remaining fossil fuel demand  that cannot be supplied by biofuels due to limited potentials.    5.4.8 assumed growth rates in scenario development  Table 5.15 shows annual market volumes and growth rates  resulting from the scenarios which are used to cross-check  dynamics of deployment pathways.  74    5  table 5.15 | assumed average growth rates and annual market volumes by renewable technology  generation    5.4.9 assumptions for fossil fuel phase out  More than 80% of the current energy supply is based on  fossil fuels. Oil dominates the entire transport sector; oil and  gas make up the heating sector and coal is the most-used  fuel for power. Each sector has different renewable energy  and energy efficiency technologies combinations which  depend on the locally available resources, infrastructure and  to some extent, lifestyle.  In line with the overall targets, the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios need to map out a clear pathway to phase-out oil  in the short-term, coal in the mid-term and gas in the longterm.  Such a pathway was described in a study from the  German Institute “Ludwig bölkow System Technik” (LbST) for  the Energy [R]evolution 2012 edition. The institute did a  detailed analysis of the global conventional oil resources,  current infrastructure of those industries, the estimated  production capacities of existing oil wells and the investment  plans known by end 2011. Greenpeace asked LbST to  evaluate the remaining fossil fuel resources between 2012  and 2050 with no new deep sea and arctic oil exploration, no  oil shale and tar sand mining because of two reasons:  • first and foremost, to limit the carbon emission to save  the climate.  • Secondly, to outline a production scenario in which all  financial resources flow from 2012 onwards only in the  development of new and larger markets for renewable  energy technologies and energy efficiency to avoid  “locking-in” new fossil fuel infrastructure.  The following graphs show how fossil fuel resources can  phase out according to this analysis. This parameter, along  with the climate targets, is fundamental to the Energy  [R]evolution scenarios.  oil – production decline assumptions  figure 5.3 shows the remaining production capacities and the  additional production capacities assuming all new projects  planned for 2012 till 2020 will go ahead. Even with new  projects, the amount of remaining conventional oil is very  limited and therefore a transition towards a low oil demand  pattern is essential.  coal – production decline assumptions  While there is an urgent need for a transition away from oil  and gas to avoid “locking-in” investments in new production  wells, the climate is the clearly limiting factor for the coal  resource, not its availability( see figure 5.4). All existing coal  mines – even without any new expansion of mines – could  produce far more coal, but its burning puts the world on a  catastrophic climate change pathway.    5.5 review: greenpeace scenario projections  of the past  Greenpeace has published numerous projections in cooperation  with Renewable Industry Associations and scientific institutions  in the past decade. This section provides an overview of the  projections between 2000 and 2014 and compares them with  real market developments and projections of the IEA World  Energy Outlook – the basis for our reference scenario.  5.5.1 the development of the global wind industry  Greenpeace and the European Wind Energy Association  published “Windforce 10” for the first time in 1999 – a global  market projection for wind turbines until 2030. Since then, an  updated prognosis has been published every second year.  Since 2006 the report has been renamed into “Global Wind  Energy Outlook” with a new partner – the Global Wind Energy  Council (GWEC) – a new umbrella organisation of all regional  wind industry associations. figure 5.5 shows the projections  made each year between 2000 and 2012 compared to the real  market data. The graph also includes the first three Energy  [R]evolution (ER) editions (published in 2007, 2008 and 2010)  against the IEA´s wind projections published in World Energy  Outlook (WEO) 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2010.  The projections from the “Wind force 10” and “Windforce 12”  were calculated by bTM consultants, Denmark.    “Windforce 10” (2001 - 2011) exact projection for the global  wind market published during this time, at 10% below the  actual market development; also all following editions where  around 10% above or below the real market. from 2006  onwards, the new “Global Wind Energy Outlook” had two  different scenarios, a moderate and an advanced wind power  market projection calculated by GWEC and Greenpeace  International. The figures here show only the advanced  projections, as the moderate were too low. However, these  projections were the most criticised at the time, being called  “over ambitious” or even “impossible”.  In contrast, the IEA “Current Policies” projections seriously  underestimated the wind industry’s ability to increase  manufacturing capacity and reduce costs. In 2000, the IEA  WEO published projections of global installed capacity for  wind turbines of 32,500 MW for 2010. This capacity had been  connected to the grid by early 2003, only two-and-a-half  years later. In 2014, the annual global wind market was at  39,000 MW increasing the total cumulative capacity to  around 370,000 MW; around ten times more than the IEA’s  assumption a decade earlier.  Only time will tell if the GPI/DLR/GWEC longer-term  projections for the global wind industry will remain close to  the real market. However the IEA WEO projections over the  past decade have been constantly increased and keep  coming close to our progressive growth rates.    box 5.1 | article from meister consultants group  “renewable energy revolution” Published March 16, 201528  the energy world is undergoing massive transformation.  installations of renewable energy have skyrocketed around the  world, exceeding most predictions from less than a decade ago.  A record-breaking amount of wind and solar power was  installed globally in 2014, in what the uS Department of Energy  has characterized as an “energy revolution.” but how strong is  this momentum? How much have renewable technologies like  solar Pv and wind actually grown in recent years?  solar and wind: outpacing (most) expert projections.  Over the past 15 years, a number of predictions – by the  International Energy Agency, the uS Energy Information  Administration, and others – have been made about the  future of renewable energy growth. Almost every one of these  predictions has underestimated the scale of actual growth  experienced by the wind and solar markets.  Only the most aggressive growth projections, such as  Greenpeace’s Energy [R]evolution scenarios, have been close  to accurate.  Greenpeace’s projections have been predicated upon  drastic structural, policy, and business changes. The recent  moves seen by E.ON, China, and across countless other  local and global institutions suggest that these changes are  already underway.  what lies ahead?  No one knows what the future electricity mix will look like,  and that uncertainty is mirrored more broadly in projections  for the energy system as a whole. Approximately 13% of  global primary energy demand is derived from renewable  sources, and it is almost a certainty that renewables will  continue to expand. The question is: by how much?  Projections and scenarios range from 15% to 82% of global  primary energy demand by 2050.  To win in the future global marketplace, business leaders and  policymakers will need to manage change effectively. The  next phase in the renewable transformation will likely involve  substantial changes to the structure of the global energy  system. This means new policies, new business models, new  grid management systems and the potential for massive  disruption – all of which raise a number of questions:  • How can policymakers, businesses, and community  leaders work together to effectively manage the  transformation?  • How can leaders align stakeholder interests to implement  the right policies and regulations across regions?  • What new business models need to be deployed to deliver  greater levels of cost effective renewable and energy  efficiency projects?  • How can investors mobilize to finance major energy  infrastructure?  Strategic questions such as these are at the forefront of  energy discussions around the world. At the same time, they  presume that energy stakeholders will have some degree of  control over the changes that are coming. As has been seen  in the past, however, renewable energy market growth has  consistently surprised (on the upside) the analysts, planners,  and policymakers who have attempted to predict the future.    5.5.2 the development of the global solar  photovoltaic industry  Inspired by the successful work with the European Wind  Energy Association (EWEA), Greenpeace started to work with  the European Photovoltaic Industry Association to publish  “SolarGeneration 10” – a global market projection for solar  photovoltaic technology up to 2020 for the first time in 2001.  Since then, six editions have been published and EPIA and  Greenpeace constantly improved the calculation  methodology with experts from both organisations. figure 5.7  shows the actual projections for each year between 2001 and  2015 compared to the real market data, against the first two  Energy [R]evolution editions (published in 2007, 2008, 2010  and 2012) and the IEA´s solar projections published in World  Energy Outlook (WEO) 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010  and 2011. The IEA did not make specific projections for solar  photovoltaic in the first editions analysed in the research,  instead used the category “Solar/Tidal/Other”.  In contrast to the wind projections, all the SolarGeneration  projections have been too conservative. The total installed  capacity in 2014 was 175,000 MW more than twice as high  as projected in SolarGeneration 2 published a decade earlier.  Even SolarGeneration 5, published in 2008, underestimated  the possible market growth of photovoltaic in the advanced  scenario. In contrast, the IEA WEO 2000 estimations for 2010  were reached in 2004.    The long-term projections for solar photovoltaic are more  difficult than for wind because the costs have dropped  significantly faster than projected. for most OECD countries,  solar has reached grid parity with retail rates from utilities in  2014 and other solar technologies, such as concentrating  solar power plants (CSP), are also headed in that direction.  Therefore, future projections for solar photovoltaic do not just  depend on cost improvements, but also on available storage  technologies. Grid integration can actually be a bottle-neck  to solar that is now expected much earlier than estimated.  5.6 how does the energy [r]evolution scenario  compare to other scenarios?  The International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a  ground-breaking new “Special Report on Renewables”  (SRREN) in May 2011. This report showed the latest and most  comprehensive analysis of scientific reports on all renewable  energy resources and global scientifically accepted energy  scenarios. The Energy [R]evolution was among three scenarios  chosen as an indicative scenario for an ambitious renewable  energy pathway. The following summarises the IPCC’s view.  four future pathways, from the following models were  assessed intensively:  • International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook 2009,  (IEA WEO 2009)  • Greenpeace Energy [R]evolution 2010, (ER 2010)  • (ReMIND-RECIPE)  • (MiniCam EMf 22)  The World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency was  used as an example baseline scenario (least amount of  development of renewable energy) and the other three treated as  “mitigation scenarios”, to address climate change risks. The four  scenarios provide substantial additional information on a number of  technical details, represent a range of underlying assumptions and  follow different methodologies. They provide different renewable  energy deployment paths, including Greenpeace’s “optimistic  application path for renewable energy assuming that the current  high dynamic (increase rates) in the sector can be maintained”.  The IPCC notes that scenario results are determined partly by  assumptions, but also might depend on the underlying  modelling architecture and model specific restrictions, so the  scenarios analysed use different modelling architectures,  demand projections and technology portfolios for the supply  side. The full results are provided in Table 5.16, but in summary:  • The IEA baseline has a high demand projection with low  renewable energy development.  • ReMind-RECIPE, MiniCam EMf 22 scenarios portrays a  high demand expectation and significant increase of  renewable energy is combined with the possibility to  employ CCS and nuclear.  • The ER 2010 relies on low demand (due to a significant  increase of energy efficiency) combined with high  renewable energy deployment, no CCS employment and a  global nuclear phase-out by 2045.  both population increase and GDP development are major  driving forces on future energy demand and therefore at least  indirectly determining the resulting shares of renewable  energy. The IPCC analysis shows which models use  assumptions based on outside inputs and what results are  generated from within the models. All scenarios take a 50%  increase of the global population into account on baseline  2009. Regards gross domestic product (GDP), all assume or  calculate a significant increase in terms of the GDP. The IEA  WEO 2009 and the ER 2010 model use forecasts of the  International Monetary fund (IMf 2009) and the Organisation  of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) as  inputs to project GSP. The other two scenarios calculate GDP  from within their model. Table 5.16 provides an overview of  key parameter of the IPCC analysis and puts them in the  context of scenarios from IEA and Greenpeace which have  been published in the aftermath of the SRREN.    6.1 global scenario results  The development of future global energy demand is  determined by three key factors  • Population development: the number of people consuming  energy or using energy services.  • Economic development, for which Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) is the most commonly used indicator: in general an  increase in GDP triggers an increase in energy demand.  • Energy intensity: how much energy is required to produce a  unit of GDP.  The Reference scenario and the Energy [R]evolution scenarios  are based on the same projections of population and economic  development. The future development of energy intensity,  however, differs between the reference and the alternative  cases, taking into account the measures to increase energy  efficiency under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios.  6.1.1 projection of energy intensity  An increase in economic activity and a growing population  does not necessarily have to result in an equivalent increase  in energy demand. There is still a large potential for exploiting  energy efficiency measures. under the Reference scenario we  assume that energy intensity will be reduced by 1.85% on  average per year, leading to a reduction in final energy  demand per unit of GDP of about 51% between 2012 and  2050. under the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario it is  assumed that energy intensity decreases by 3.45 % while the  Advanced Energy [R]evolution achieves minus 3.55 % per  year due to active policy and technical support for energy  efficiency measures and will lead to an even higher reduction  in energy intensity of almost 75% until 2050.    6.1 world  6.1.2 final energy demand by sector  Combining the projections on population development, GDP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for World’s final energy demand. These are shown in  figure 6. for the Reference and Energy [R]evolution scenarios.  under the Reference scenario, total final energy demand  increases by 65% from the current 326,900 Pj/a to around  539,000 Pj/a in 2050. In the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario, final energy demand decreases by 12% compared  to current consumption and is expected to reach 289,000  Pj/a by 2050. The Advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.1.3). Total electricity demand will rise from about  18,860 TWh/a to 37,000 TWh/a by 2050 in the basic Energy  [R]evolution scenario. Compared to the Reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 16,700 TWh/a.  This reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. The transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the Advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to more  than 40,000 TWh/a. Electricity will become the major  renewable ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various  purposes but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for  fossil fuels substitution. Around 8,100 TWh are used in 2050  for electric vehicles and rail transport in the Advanced  scenario, around 5,100 TWh for hydrogen and 3,600 TWh for  synthetic liquid fuel generation for the transport sector  (excluding bunkers).  Efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. under the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 76,000 Pj/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  Reference scenario. As a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied with much lower future energy demand.    6.1.2 electricity generation  The development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. This  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. by 2050, 92% of the electricity  produced worldwide will come from renewable energy sources  in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario. ‘New’ renewables –  mainly wind, Pv, CSP and geothermal energy – will contribute  68% to the total electricity generation. Already by 2020 the  share of renewable electricity production will be 31% and 58%  by 2030. The installed capacity of renewables will reach about  7,770 GW in 2030 and more than 17,000 GW by 2050.  A 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the Advanced scenario leads to around 23,600 GW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  Table 6.1.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies worldwide over time. up to 2020  wind and Pv will become the main contributors to the  growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth of  wind and Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar  thermal, geothermal and ocean energy. The Energy  [R]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating  power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already  31% to 36% by 2030 and 53% to 55% by 2050. Therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (DSM), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    87  6.1.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.1.7 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the Reference scenario until 2030. This difference in full  cost of generation will be less than 0.2 uS$ct/kWh in both  Energy [R]evolution scenarios, without taking into account  integration costs for storage or other load-balancing  measures. because of increasing prices for conventional  fuels, electricity generation costs will become economically  favourable starting in 2030 under the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios. by 2050, the cost will be 2.5/1.7 uS$ct/kWh,  respectively, below those in the Reference case.  under the Reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s uS$ 2,063 billion  per year to more than uS$ 5,400 billion in 2050, compared to  uS$ 4,300 billion in the basic and uS$ 6,200 billion in the  Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario. figure 6.1.7 shows  that both Energy [R]evolution scenarios not only comply with  World´s CO2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are more than 19% lower in the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario than in the Reference scenario. The Advanced  scenario with 100% renewable power and an increase in  power generation of 35% results in supply costs 16% higher  than the Reference case.  6.1.4 future investments in the power sector  Around uS$ 48,000 billion is required in investment for the  Energy [R]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately uS$ 1,233 billion per year, around  uS$ 23,500 billion more than in the Reference scenario  (uS$ 24,500 billion). Investments for the Advanced scenario  add up to uS$ 64,600 billion until 2050, on average  uS$ 1,656 billion per year, including high investments in  additional power plants for the production of synthetic fuels.  under the Reference scenario, the levels of investment in  conventional power plants add up to almost 50% while  approximately 50% would be invested in renewable energies  and cogeneration until 2050.  under the Energy [R]evolution scenarios, however, World  would shift almost 93%/94% of the entire investment towards  renewables and cogeneration, respectively. by 2030, the  fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be focused  mainly on gas power plants.  because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario reach a total  of more than uS$ 39,000 billion up to 2050, around uS$  1,000 billion per year. The total fuel cost savings therefore  would cover 170% of the total additional investments  compared to the Reference scenario. fuel cost savings in the  Advanced scenario are even higher and add up to uS$ 42,000  billion, or uS$ 1,080 billion per year. Renewable energy  sources would then go on to produce electricity without any  further fuel costs beyond 2050, while costs for coal and gas  will continue to be a burden on national economies.    6.1.5 energy supply for heating  Today, renewables meet around 21% of World’s energy  demand for heating, the main contribution coming from the  use of biomass. Dedicated support instruments are required  to ensure a dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. In the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 42% of World’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 86% in 2050.  • Energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 33% in 2050  (relative to the Reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • In the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  CO2 emissions.  Table 6.1.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating worldwide over time. up to 2030  biomass remains the main contributor of the growing market  share. After 2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors  and a growing share of geothermal and environmental heat as  well as heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the  dependence on fossil fuels. The Advanced scenario results in  a complete substitution of the remaining gas consumption by  hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.    6.1.6 future investments in the heating sector  Also in the heating sector the Energy [R]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment strategies  in heating technologies. In particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped for  the heating sector. The use of biomass for heating purposes -  often traditional biomass today - will be substantially reduced  in the Energy [R]evolution scenarios and replaced by more  efficient and sustainable renewable heating technologies.  Renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to very  sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems. Thus,  it can only be roughly estimated that the Energy [R]evolution  scenario in total requires around uS$ 16,300 billion to be  invested in renewable heating technologies up to 2050  (including investments for replacement after the economic  lifetime of the plants) - approximately uS$ 420 billion per year.    * Excluding direct electric heating.  ref 2012-2050 e[r] 2012-2050 adv e[r] 2012-2050  The Advanced scenario assumes an even more ambitious  expansion of renewable technologies resulting in an average  investment of around uS$ 429 billion per year, while the main  strategy in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining  natural gas amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.  6.1.7 future employment in the energy sector  the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario results in more  energy sector jobs at every stage of the projection.  • There are 36.2 million energy sector jobs in the Advanced  Energy [R]evolution in 2020, and 30.1 million in the  Reference scenario.  • In 2025, there are 46.7 million jobs in the Advanced Energy  [R]evolution scenario, and 29.6 million in the Reference scenario.  • In 2030, there are 48 million jobs in the Advanced Energy  [R]evolution scenario and 28 million in the Reference scenario.  figure 6.1.11 shows the change in job numbers under all  scenarios for each technology between 2015 and 2030.  jobs in the coal sector decline in both the Reference scenario  and the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario, as a result of  productivity improvements in the industry, coupled with a move  away from coal in the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario.  In the Reference scenario jobs increase slightly to 2020, after  which energy sector jobs decline. This is mainly driven by  losses in the coal sector. At 2030, jobs are 3% (2.2 million)  below 2015 levels.  In the Advanced Energy [R]evolution scenario, strong growth  in the renewable sector leads to an increase of 26% in total  energy sector jobs by 2020, and job numbers are nearly 70%  above 2015 levels in 2025. job numbers continue to rise  after 2025, to reach 46.1 million by 2030.  Renewable energy accounts for 86% of energy jobs by 2030.  The greatest share are in biomass (25%), followed by solar Pv  and wind energy.    6.1.8 transport  A key target is to introduce incentives for people to drive  smaller cars and buy new, more efficient vehicle concepts. In  addition, it is vital to shift transport use to efficient modes like  rail, light rail and buses, especially in the expanding large  metropolitan areas. Along with rising prices for fossil fuels,  these changes reduce the further growth in car sales  projected under the Reference scenario. Due to population  increase, GDP growth and higher living standards, energy  demand from the transport sector is expected to increase in  the Reference scenario by around 65% to 1480,00 Pj/a in  2050. In the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario, efficiency  measures and modal shifts will save 53% (78,700 Pj/a) in  2050 compared to the Reference scenario.  Additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the Advanced scenario of 62%  (92,000 Pj/a) in 2050 compared to the Reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. by 2030, electricity will provide 9% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the Energy  [R]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 39% (14%/52% in  the Advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the transport  sector. In 2050, up to 14,000 Pj/a of hydrogen is used in the  transport sector for the Advanced Energy [R]evolution  scenario. A global maximum of 9,300 Pj/a of biofuels is used  in the basic Energy [R]evolution in 2050 while in the Advanced  case consumption is lower (around 8,000 Pj/a).    6.1.9 development of co2 emissions  Whilst World’s emissions of CO2 will increase by 56% between  2012 and 2050 under the Reference scenario, under the  Energy [R]evolution scenario they will decrease from 30,470  million tonnes in 2012 to 4,360 million tonnes in 2050. Annual  per capita emissions will drop from 4.3 tonne to 0.5 tonne. In  spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production and  increasing power demand, CO2 emissions will decrease in the  electricity sector. In the long run efficiency gains and the  increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles strongly  reduce emissions in the transport sector as well. With a 31%  share of CO2, the Industry sector will be the largest source of  emissions in 2050 in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario. by  2050, World´s CO2 emissions are 80% below 1990 levels in the  Energy [R]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the Advanced case.  6.1.10 primary energy consumption  Taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the Energy  [R]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.1.14. under the  basic Energy [R]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 19% from today’s 534,870 Pj/a to around  433,000 Pj/a (excluding non-energy consumption).  Compared to the Reference scenario, overall primary energy  demand will be reduced by 50% in 2050 under the Energy  [R]evolution scenario (Reference scenario: around 860,000  Pj in 2050). The Advanced scenario results due to additional  conversion losses in a primary energy consumption of around  450,000 Pj in 2050.  The Energy [R]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of  very efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to  replace oil based combustion engines. This leads to an  overall renewable primary energy share of 33% in 2030 and  76% in 2050 in the basic Energy [R]evolution and of more  than 92% in 2050 in the Advanced case (incl. non-energy  consumption). In contrast to the Reference scenario, no new  nuclear power plants will be built worldwide in the Energy  [R]evolution scenarios.    6.2.1 final energy demand by sector  Combining the projections on population development, GDP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for OECD North America’s final energy demand.  These are shown in figure 6.2.1 for the Reference and Energy  [R]evolution scenarios. under the Reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 20% from the current  67,800 Pj/a to 81,600 Pj/a in 2050. In the basic Energy  [R]evolution scenario, final energy demand decreases by 45%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  37,300 Pj/a by 2050. The Advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.2.2). Total electricity demand will rise from about  4,460 TWh/a to 4,610 TWh/a by 2050 in the basic Energy  [R]evolution scenario. Compared to the Reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 3,650 TWh/a.  6.2 oeCd north ameriCa  This reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. The transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the Advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  5,000 TWh/a. Electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. Around 1,180 TWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the Advanced scenario,  around 900 TWh for hydrogen and 500 TWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  Efficiency gains in the heating sector are large as well. under  the Energy [R]evolution scenarios, consumption equivalent to  about 7,400 Pj/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050  compared to the Reference scenario. As a result of energy-related  renovation of the existing stock of residential  buildings, the introduction of low energy standards and  ‘passive climatisation’ for new buildings, as well as highly  efficient air conditioning systems, enjoyment of the same  comfort and energy services will be accompanied with much  lower future energy demand.    6.2.2 electricity generation  The development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. This  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the Energy [R]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. by 2050, 95% of the electricity  produced in OECD North America will come from renewable  energy sources in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario.  ‘New’ renewables – mainly wind, Pv, CSP and geothermal  energy – will contribute 80% to the total electricity  generation. Already by 2020 the share of renewable electricity  production will be 32% and 66% by 2030. The installed  capacity of renewables will reach about 1,620 GW in 2030  and 2,350 GW by 2050.  A 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the Advanced scenario leads to around 3,100 GW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  Table 6.2.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in OECD North America over time.  up to 2020 wind and Pv will become the main contributors to  the growing market share. After 2020, the continuing growth  of wind and Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar  thermal, geothermal and ocean energy. The Energy  [R]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating  power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already  41% to 47% by 2030 and 57% to 59% by 2050. Therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (DSM), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.2.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.2.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both Energy [R]evolution scenarios increases  the future costs of electricity generation compared to the  Reference scenario until 2040. This difference in full cost of  generation will be less than 1.5 uS$ct/kWh in the basic Energy  [R]evolution and about 2.1 uS$ct/kWh in the Advanced scenario,  without taking into account integration costs for storage or other  load-balancing measures. because of increasing prices for  conventional fuels, electricity generation costs will become  economically favourable after 2040 under the Energy [R]evolution  scenario. by 2050, in the Energy [R]evolution the cost will be 0.5  uS$ct/kWh below and in the Advanced scenario 0.4 uS$ct/kWh  above those in the Reference case.  under the Reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total electricity  supply costs rising from today’s uS$ 303 billion per year to more  than uS$ 645 billion in 2050, compared to  uS$ 583 billion in the basic and uS$ 808 billion in the Advanced  Energy [R]evolution scenario. figure 6.2.6 shows that both  Energy [R]evolution scenarios not only comply with OECD North  America’s CO2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  Increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are more than 10% lower in the basic Energy [R]evolution  scenario than in the Reference scenario. The Advanced  scenario with 100% renewable power in supply costs 25%  higher than the Reference case, but a reduction of CO2  intensity to zero.  6.2.4 future investments in the power sector  Around uS$ 8,300 billion is required in investment for the  Energy [R]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of the  plants) - approximately uS$ 213 billion per year, uS$ 4,020  billion more than in the Reference scenario (uS$ 4,280 billion).  Investments for the Advanced scenario sum up to uS$ 10,620  billion until 2050, on average uS$ 272 billion per year,  including high investments for additional power plants for the  production of synthetic fuels. under the Reference scenario,  the levels of investment in conventional power plants add up  to almost 57% while approximately 43% would be invested in  renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  under the Energy [R]evolution scenarios, however, OECD  North America would shift almost 90%/91% of the entire  investment towards renewables and cogeneration,  respectively. by 2030, the fossil fuel share of power sector  investment would be focused mainly on gas power plants.  because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic Energy [R]evolution scenario reach a total  of uS$ 4,390 billion up to 2050, uS$ 113 billion per year. The  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 110% of the  total additional investments compared to the Reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the Advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to uS$ 4,680 billion, or uS$ 120  billion per year. Renewable energy sources would then go on  to produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.2.5 energy supply for heating  Today, renewables meet around 11% of OECD North  America’s energy demand for heating, the main contribution  coming from the use of biomass. Dedicated support  instruments are required to ensure a dynamic development in  particular for renewable technologies for buildings and  renewable process heat production. In the basic Energy  [R]evolution scenario, renewables already provide 39% of  OECD North America’s total heat demand in 2030 and 89% in  2050.  • The efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 29 % in 2050  (relative to the Reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • In the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • A shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  CO2 emissions.  Table 6.2.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in OECD North America over time.  up to 2030 biomass remains the main contributor of the  growing market share. After 2030, the continuing growth of  solar collectors and a growing share of geothermal and  environmental heat as well as heat from renewable hydrogen  will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The  Advanced scenario results in a complete substitution of the  remaining gas consumption by hydrogen generated from  renewable electricity.    6.2.6 future investments in the heating sector  Also in the heating sector the Energy [R]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. In particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. The use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the Energy [R]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  Renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  Thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the Energy  [R]evolution scenario in total requires around  uS$ 3,550 billion to be invested in renewable heating  technologies up to 2050 (including investments for  replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately uS$ 91 billion per year. The Advanced  scenario assumes the same ambitious expansion of  renewable technologies, while the main strategy in the  scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.    6.2.8 transport  a key target in oecd north america is to introduce incentives  for people to drive smaller cars and buy new, more efficient  vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift transport use  to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in  the large metropolitan areas. along with rising prices for fossil  fuels, these changes reduce the further growth in car sales  projected under the reference scenario. due to population  increase, gdP growth and higher living standards, energy  demand from the transport sector is expected to slightly  increase in the reference scenario by around 7% to 31,710  PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  efficiency measures and modal shifts will save 65% (20,630  PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 72%  (22,700 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 11% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 35% (47% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 2,500 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy    6.2.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst oecd north america’s emissions of co2 will increase  by 6% between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario,  under the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  5,950 million tonnes in 2012 to 397 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 12.5 tonne to 0.7  tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production  and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will decrease in  the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency gains and the  increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles strongly  reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 40% share of co2, the transport sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, oecd north america’s co2  emissions are around 90% below 1990 levels in the energy  [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.2.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.2.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 46% from today’s 107,520 PJ/a to around  58,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 54% in 2050 under  the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scanario: around  126,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced energy [r]evolution  scenario results due to additional conversion losses in a  primary energy consumption of around 61,100 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and oil  as fast as technically and economically possible by expansion of  renewable energies and a fast introduction of very efficient  vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil based  combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable primary  energy share of 34% in 2030 and 80% in 2050 in the basic  energy [r]evolution and of more than 92% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to the  reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be built in  oecd north america in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.  102    6.3.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for latin america’s final energy demand. these are  shown in figure 6.3.1 for the reference and energy  [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 91% from the current  19,000 PJ/a to 36,300 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand decreases by 6%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  17,900 PJ/a by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.3.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  990 tWh/a to 2,230 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 840 tWh/a.  6.3 latin america  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  2,500 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 600 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 430 tWh for hydrogen and 90 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 6,900 PJ/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  reference scenario. as a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied by much lower future energy demand.    6.3.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuelfired  power plants as well. By 2050, 94% of the electricity  produced in latin america will come from renewable energy  sources in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’  renewables – mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy –  will contribute 50% to the total electricity generation. already  by 2020 the share of renewable electricity production will be  71% and 84% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables  will reach about 440 gW in 2030 and 930 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 1,230 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.3.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in latin america over time. Until 2040  hydro will remain the main renewable power source. By 2020  wind and Pv overtake biomass, currently the second largest  contributor to the growing renewable market. after 2020, the  continuing growth of wind and Pv will be complemented by  electricity from solar thermal, geothermal and ocean energy.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of  fluctuating power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of  already 25% to 33% by 2030 and 41% to 49% by 2050.  therefore, smart grids, demand side management (dsm),  energy storage capacities and other options need to be  expanded in order to increase the flexibility of the power  system for grid integration, load balancing and a secure  supply of electricity.    6.3.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.3.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared to  the reference scenario before 2030. this difference in full cost  of generation will be less than 0.2 Us$ct/kWh in the basic  energy [r]evolution scenario and slightly more than  0.2 Us$ct/kWh in the advanced scenario, without taking into  account integration costs for storage or other load-balancing  measures. Because of increasing prices for conventional fuels,  electricity generation costs will become economically  favourable starting in 2030 under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios. By 2050, the cost will be 1.8 Us$ct/kWh below  those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 87 billion per  year to more than Us$ 279 billion in 2050, compared to Us$  270 billion in the basic and Us$ 331 billion in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.3.6 shows that both  energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with latin  america´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise  energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are 3% lower in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario than in  the reference scenario despite a 7% increase in electricity  production. the advanced scenario with 100% renewable  power and an increase in power generation of 36% results in  supply costs 19% higher than the reference case.  6.3.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 2,600 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately Us$ 67 billion per year, Us$ 1,200  billion more than in the reference scenario (Us$ 1,400  billion). investments for the advanced scenario sum up to  Us$ 3,390 billion until 2050, on average Us$ 87 billion per  year. Under the reference scenario, the levels of investment  in conventional power plants add up to almost 24% while  approximately 76% would be invested in renewable energies  and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, latin  america would shift almost 94%/97% of the entire investment  towards renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030,  the fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be  focused mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 1,880 billion up to 2050, Us$ 48 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 160% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 2,040 billion, or Us$ 52 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.3.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 39% of latin america’s  energy demand for heating, the main contribution coming  from the use of biomass. dedicated support instruments are  required to ensure a dynamic development in particular for  renewable technologies for buildings and renewable process  heat production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 63% of latin america’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 93% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 43 % in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.3.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in latin america over time. although  biomass remains the main contributor, its market share is  decrasing and with it unefficient traditional biomass. after  2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors and a growing  share of geothermal and environmental heat as well as heat  from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence  on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in a complete  substitution of the remaining gas consumption by hydrogen  generated from renewable electricity.    6.3.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 580 billion  to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to 2050  (including investments for replacement after the economic  lifetime of the plants) - approximately Us$ 15 billion per year.  the advanced scenario assumes an equally ambitious  expansion of renewable technologies resulting in an average  investment of around Us$ 15 billion per year, while the main  strategy in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining  natural gas amounts with electricity, hydrogen or other  synthetic fuels.    6.3.8 transport  a key target in latin america is to introduce incentives for  people to drive smaller cars and buy new, more efficient  vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift transport use  to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in  the expanding large metropolitan areas. along with rising  prices for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the further  growth in car sales projected under the reference scenario.  due to population increase, gdP growth and higher living  standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to increase in the reference scenario by around  61% to 11,030 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario, efficiency measures and modal shifts will save 47%  (5,150 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 57%  (6,290 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 6% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 31% (46% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,180 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy    6.3.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst latin america’s emissions of co2 will increase by 78%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  1,230 million tonnes in 2012 to 138 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 2.5 tonne to 0.2  tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production  and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will decrease  in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency gains and  the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles strongly  reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 39% share of co2, the transport sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, latin america’s co2  emissions are around 76% below 1990 levels in the energy  [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.3.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.3.12. Under the basic  energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand increases  slightly from today’s 27,120 PJ/a and starts to decrease after  2020 to again around 27,000 PJ/a in 2050. compared to the  reference scenario, overall primary energy demand will be  reduced by 44% in 2050 under the energy [r]evolution] scenario  (reference scenario: around 49,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced  scenario results due to additional conversion losses in a primary  energy consumption of around 28,700 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of very  efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil  based combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable  primary energy share of 52% in 2030 and 86% in 2050 in the  basic energy [r]evolution and of more than 95% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to  the reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be  built in latin america in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.    6.4.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for oecd europe’s final energy demand. these are  shown in figure 6.4.1 for the reference and energy  [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 15% from the current  46,600 PJ/a to 53,500 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand decreases by 36%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  29,800 PJ/a by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.4.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  3,070 tWh/a to 3,420 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 1,700 tWh/a.  6.4 oecd europe  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  3,900 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 710 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 580 tWh for hydrogen and 210 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 8,800 PJ/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  reference scenario. as a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied with much lower future energy demand.    6.4.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. By 2050, 94% of the electricity  produced in oecd europe will come from renewable energy  sources in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’  renewables – mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy –  will contribute 64% to the total electricity generation. already  by 2020 the share of renewable electricity production will be  42% and 66% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables  will reach about 1,050 gW in 2030 and 1,660 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 2,280 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.4.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in oecd europe over time. Up to  2020 wind and Pv will become the main contributors to the  growing market share. after 2020, the continuing growth of  wind and Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar  thermal, geothermal and ocean energy. the energy  [r]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating  power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already  35% to 38% by 2030 and 56% to 62% by 2050. therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (dsm), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.  116    6.4.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.4.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario until 2030. this difference in full  cost of generation will be less than 0.8 Us$ct/kWh in the  basic energy [r]evolution and about 1 Us$ct/kWh in the  advanced scenario, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because  of increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  starting in 2040 under the energy [r]evolution scenario.  By 2050, the cost will be 1.1 Us$ct/kWh below and in the  advanced scenario equal to those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 290 billion per  year to more than Us$ 538 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 427 billion in the basic and Us$ 601 billion in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.4.6 shows  that the energy [r]evolution scenario not only complys with  oecd europe´s co2 reduction targets, but also helps stabilise  energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are more than 21% lower in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario than in the reference scenario. the advanced  scenario with 100% renewable power and an increase in  power generation of 12% results in supply costs 12% higher  than the reference case.  6.4.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 5,430 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of the  plants) - approximately Us$ 139 billion per year, Us$ 1,730  billion more than in the reference scenario (Us$ 3,700 billion).  investments for the advanced scenario add up to Us$ 6,720  billion until 2050, on average Us$ 172 billion per year,  including high investments in additional power plants for the  production of synthetic fuels. Under the reference scenario,  the levels of investment in conventional power plants add up  to almost 30% while approximately 70% would be invested in  renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, oecd  europe would shift almost 93%/94% of the entire investment  towards renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030,  the fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be  focused mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 3,610 billion up to 2050, Us$ 93 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 210% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 3,780 billion, or Us$ 97 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.4.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 16% of oecd europe’s  energy demand for heating, the main contribution coming  from the use of biomass. dedicated support instruments are  required to ensure a dynamic development in particular for  renewable technologies for buildings and renewable process  heat production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 45% of oecd europe’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 86% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 33% in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.4.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in oecd europe over time. Up to  2030 biomass remains the main contributor of the growing  market share. after 2030, the continuing growth of solar  collectors and a growing share of geothermal and  environmental heat as well as heat from renewable hydrogen  will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. the  advanced scenario results in a complete substitution of the  remaining gas consumption by hydrogen generated from  renewable electricity.  118    6  figure 6.4.8 | oecd europe: projection of heat supply by energy carrier – reference, energy [r]evolution,  advanced energy [r]evolution scenarios  0  5,000  10,000  15,000  20,000  25,000  30,000  PJ/a  2012 2020 2025 2030 2040 2050  REF E[R] ADV REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R]  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  FOSSIL  BIOMASS  SOLAR HEATING  GEOTHERMAL HEATING  & HEAT PUMPS  ELECTRIC HEATING  HYDROGEN  EFFICIENCY  table 6.4.2 | oecd europe: projection of renewable  heat supply under the reference and both energy  [r]evolution scenarios in pj/a  2012 2020 2030 2040 2050  Biomass ref 2,387 2,908 3,441 4,007 4,717  e[r] 2,387 2,937 3,712 3,770 3,874  adv 2,387 2,937 3,712 3,770 3,940  solar Heating ref 107 211 351 500 685  e[r] 107 362 1,816 3,061 3,811  adv 107 362 1,816 3,209 4,016  geotHermal Heat ref 179 258 344 467 620  and Heat PUmPs e[r] 179 487 1,870 4,018 5,080  adv 179 487 1,870 4,108 5,301  Hydrogen ref 0 0 0 0 0  e[r] 0 0 3 132 627  adv 0 0 174 756 2,283  total ref 2,673 3,377 4,135 4,974 6,022  e[r] 2,673 3,785 7,401 10,981 13,393  adv 2,673 3,785 7,572 11,842 15,540  119  6.4.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around  Us$ 2,820 billion to be invested in renewable heating  technologies up to 2050 (including investments for  replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately Us$ 72 billion per year. the advanced  scenario assumes an even more ambitious expansion of  renewable technologies resulting in an average investment of  around Us$ 76 billion per year, while the main strategy in the  scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.  6  figure 6.4.9 | oecd europe: development of investments for renewable heat generation technologies –  reference, energy [r]evolution, advanced energy [r]evolution scenarios  energy  [r]evolution  table 6.4.3 | oecd europe: installed capacities for  renewable heat generation under the scenarios in gw  2012 2020 2030 2040 2050  Biomass ref 419 479 530 588 645  e[r] 419 448 417 372 322  adv 419 448 417 372 322  geotHermal ref 2 3 5 8 9  e[r] 2 5 37 77 85  adv 2 5 37 77 100  solar Heating ref 32 63 104 148 202  e[r] 32 109 517 836 1,021  adv 32 109 517 881 1,087  Heat PUmPs ref 30 42 56 75 101  e[r] 30 74 245 478 611  adv 30 74 245 492 631  total* ref 482 588 695 819 957  e[r] 482 636 1,216 1,763 2,039  adv 482 636 1,216 1,822 2,140  BIOMASS, 53%  HEAT PUMPS, 21%  SOLAR, 24%  GEOTHERMAL, 2%  TOTAL  990 BILLION USD  BIOMASS, 4%  HEAT PUMPS, 48%  SOLAR, 43%  GEOTHERMAL, 5%  TOTAL  2,820 BILLION USD  BIOMASS, 4%  HEAT PUMPS, 46%  SOLAR, 43%  GEOTHERMAL, 7%  TOTAL  2,965 BILLION USD  * excluding direct electric heating.  ref 2012-2050 e[r] 2012-2050 adv e[r] 2012-2050  6.4.7 future employment in the energy sector  the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario results in more  energy sector jobs in oecd europe at every stage of  the projection.  • there are 2 million energy sector jobs in the advanced  energy [r]evolution in 2020, and 1.1 million in the  reference scenario.  • in 2025, there are 2.8 million jobs in the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario, and 1.1 million in the reference scenario.  • in 2030, there are 2.7 million jobs in the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario and 1.1 million in the reference scenario.  figure 6.4.10 shows the change in job numbers under both  scenarios for each technology between 2015 and 2030.

Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 11% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 40% (51% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, more than 1,610 PJ/a of hydrogen  is used in the transport sector for the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario.  6  energy  [r]evolution  table 6.4.5 | oecd europe: projection of transport  energy demand by mode in the reference and the  energy [r]evolution scenarios in pj/a  2012 2020 2030 2040 2050  rail ref 387 401 417 430 442  e[r] 387 407 417 434 446  adv 387 422 570 743 866  road ref 12,527 12,572 12,557 11,937 11,328  e[r] 12,527 11,069 8,157 5,690 4,925  adv 12,527 10,985 7,451 4,494 3,617  domestic aviation ref 262 400 491 507 518  e[r] 262 380 410 390 370  adv 262 376 385 339 296  domestic ref 238 300 331 338 341  navigation e[r] 238 290 265 247 240  adv 238 290 265 247 240  total ref 13,414 13,673 13,796 13,213 12,629  e[r] 13,414 12,146 9,249 6,761 5,980  adv 13,414 12,074 8,671 5,823 5,019  figure 6.4.11 | oecd europe: final energy consumption in transport under the scenarios  0  2,000  4,000  6,000  8,000  10,000  12,000  14,000  16,000  PJ/a  2012 2020 2025 2030 2040 2050  REF E[R] ADV REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R] REF E[R]  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  ADV  E[R]  OIL PRODUCTS  NATURAL GAS  BIOFUELS  SYNFUELS  ELECTRICITY  HYDROGEN  EFFICIENCY  6.4.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst oecd europe’s emissions of co2 will decrease by 10%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from 3,720  million tonnes in 2012 to 329 million tonnes in 2050. annual  per capita emissions will drop from 6.6 tonne to  0.5 tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power  production and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will  decrease in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency  gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles  strongly reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 31% share of co2, the industry sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, oecd europe´s co2  emissions are around 92% below 1990 levels in the energy  [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.4.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.4.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand will  decrease by 44% from today’s 72,960 PJ/a to around 41,000  PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall primary  energy demand will be reduced by 46% in 2050 under the  energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario: around  76,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results due to  additional conversion losses in a primary energy consumption  of around 42,400 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and oil  as fast as technically and economically possible by expansion  of renewable energies and a fast introduction of very efficient  vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil based  combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable primary  energy share of 37% in 2030 and 79% in 2050 in the basic  energy [r]evolution and of more than 92% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to  the reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be  built in oecd europe in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.  122    6.5.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for africa’s final energy demand. these are shown in  figure 6.5.1 for the reference and energy [r]evolution  scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total final energy  demand increases by 111% from the current 21,700 PJ/a to  45,700 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  final energy demand increases at a much lower rate by 26%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  27,300 PJ/a by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.5.2). total electricity demand will rise from about 590  tWh/a to 2,890 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 360 tWh/a.  6.5 africa  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to 3,100  tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable ‘primary’  energy, not only for direct use for various purposes but also for  the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels substitution.  around 490 tWh are used in 2050 for electric vehicles and rail  transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario, around 560 tWh  for hydrogen and 790 tWh for synthetic liquid fuel generation  for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in the  electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios,  consumption equivalent to about 3,600 PJ/a is avoided  through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the reference  scenario. as a result of the introduction of low energy  standards and highly efficient technologies e.g. for industrial  and commercial process heat, cooking and air conditioning,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied by much lower future energy demand.    6.5.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. By 2050, 95% of the electricity  produced in africa will come from renewable energy sources  in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’ renewables –  mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy – will contribute  80% to the total electricity generation. already by 2020 the  share of renewable electricity production will be 31% and  65% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables will reach  about 380 gW in 2030 and 1,390 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 2,000 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.5.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in africa over time. Until 2020 hydro  will remain the main renewable power source. By 2020 wind  and Pv overtake biomass, currently the second largest  contributor to the growing renewable market. after 2020, the  continuing growth of wind and Pv will be complemented by  electricity from solar thermal, geothermal and ocean energy.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of  fluctuating power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of  already 38% to 45% by 2030 and 50% 2050. therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (dsm), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.5.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.5.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  decreases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario by 2030. the difference in full cost  of generation will be around 1.4 Us$ct/kWh in the basic  energy [r]evolution and around 1.3 Us$ct/kWh in the  advanced scenario, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because  of increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  starting just after 2020 under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios. By 2050, the cost will be 2.8/2.1 Us$ct/kWh,  respectively, below those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 67 billion per  year to more than Us$ 277 billion in 2050, compared to Us$  326 billion in the basic and Us$ 507 billion in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.5.6 shows that both  energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with africa´s  co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy costs  and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term total costs for electricity supply  that are only 18% higher in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario than in the reference scenario, despite a 57%  increase in electricity production. the advanced scenario with  100% renewable power and more than a doubling of generation  results in supply costs 83% higher than the reference case.  6.5.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 3,410 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately Us$ 87 billion per year, Us$ 2,220  billion more than in the reference scenario (Us$ 1,190  billion). investments for the advanced scenario sum up to  Us$ 4,890 billion until 2050, on average Us$ 125 billion per  year. Under the reference scenario, the levels of investment  in conventional power plants add up to almost 42% while  approximately 58% would be invested in renewable energies  and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, africa  would shift almost 95%/96% of the entire investment towards  renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030, the  fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be focused  mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 2,500 billion up to 2050, Us$ 64 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 110% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 2,670 billion, or Us$ 68 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.5.5 energy supply for heating  today, traditional biomass use meets around 60% of africa’s  energy demand for heat. incentives to move to improved and  modern biomass technologies are vital to enhance efficiency  and to keep biomass consumption in check. dedicated  support instruments are required to ensure a dynamic  development in particular for renewable technologies for  buildings and renewable process heat production. in the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, renewables already  provide 68% of africa’s total heat demand in 2030 and 91%  in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating and cooking by 21% in  2050 (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of  improving living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.5.8 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in africa over time. although  biomass remains the main contributor, its market share is  decrasing and with it unefficient traditional biomass. after  2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors and a growing  share of geothermal and environmental heat as well as heat  from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the dependence  on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in a complete  substitution of the remaining gas consumption by hydrogen  generated from renewable electricity.    6.5.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 610 billion  to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to 2050  (including investments for replacement after the economic  lifetime of the plants) - approximately Us$ 16 billion per year.  the advanced scenario assumes an equally ambitious  expansion of renewable technologies, while the main strategy  in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with electricity, hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.    6.5.8 transport  in 2050, the car fleet in africa will be significantly larger than  today. today, a large share of old cars are driven in africa.  With growing individual mobility, an increasing share of small  efficient cars is projected in the energy[r]evolution scenarios.  due to population increase, gdP growth and higher living  standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to increase in the reference scenario by around  170% to 10,400 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, efficiency measures and modal shifts  will save 43% (4,500 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the  reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 51%  (5,260 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 3% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 25% (35% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,540 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy    6.5.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst africa`s emissions of co2 will increase by 149%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  1,050 million tonnes in 2012 to 363 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 1 tonne to 0.2  tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production  and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will decrease  in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency gains and  the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles strongly  reduce emissions in the transport sector as well. With a 57%  share of co2, the transport sector will be the largest source  of emissions in 2050 in the basic e[r] scenario. By 2050,  africa´s co2 emissions are 33% below 1990 levels in the  energy [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is  fully decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.5.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.5.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will increase by 19% from today’s 30,970 PJ/a to around  37,000 PJ/a compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 44% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference: around  367,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results due to  additional conversion losses in a primary energy consumption  of around 39,500 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of  very efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to  replace oil based combustion engines. this leads to an  overall renewable primary energy share of 56% in 2030 and  81% in 2050 in the basic energy [r]evolution and of more  than 97% in 2050 in the advanced case (incl. non-energy  consumption). in contrast to the reference scenario, no new  nuclear power plants will be built in africa in the energy  [r]evolution scenarios.    6.6.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for middle east’s final energy demand. these are  shown in figure 6.6.1 for the reference and energy  [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 134% from the current  15,300 PJ/a to 35,800 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand increases at a  much lower rate by 12% compared to current consumption  and is expected to reach 17,200 PJ/a by 2050. the  advanced scenario results in some additional reductions due  to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.6.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  730 tWh/a to 2,440 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 810 tWh/a.  6.6 middle east  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  2,700 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 650 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 650 tWh for hydrogen and 60 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in the  electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios,  consumption equivalent to about 6,600 PJ/a is avoided  through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the reference  scenario. as a result of the introduction of low energy  standards and highly efficient technologies e.g. for industrial  and commercial process heat, cooking and air conditioning,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied by much lower future energy demand.    6.6.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the strong reduction of  fossil fuel fired power plants in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios. By 2050, 93% of the electricity produced in middle  east will come from renewable energy sources in the basic  energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’ renewables – mainly  wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy – will contribute 86%  to the total electricity generation. already by 2020 the share  of renewable electricity production will be 14% and 52% by  2030. the installed capacity of renewables will reach about  360 gW in 2030 and 1,170 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 1,510 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.6.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in middle east over time. By 2020  wind and Pv overtake hydro, currently the largest contributor  to the growing renewable market. after 2020, the continuing  growth of wind and Pv will be complemented by electricity  from solar thermal, geothermal and ocean energy. the energy  [r]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating  power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already  28% to 34% by 2030 and 45% to 41% by 2050. therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (dsm), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.6.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.6.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  decreases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario by 2030. this difference in full cost  of generation will be less than 2.8 Us$ct/kWh in the basic  energy [r]evolution and about 3 Us$ct/kWh in the advanced  scenario, without taking into account integration costs for  storage or other load-balancing measures. Because of  increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity generation  costs will become economically favourable in the future under  the energy [r]evolution scenarios. By 2050, the cost will be  6.8/5.8 Us$ct/kWh, respectively, below those in the  reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 138 billion per  year to more than Us$ 379 billion in 2050, compared to Us$  302 billion in the basic and Us$ 453 billion in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.6.6 shows that both  energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with middle  east´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are 20% lower in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario than in  the reference scenario despite a 40% increase in electricity  production. the advanced scenario with 100% renewable  power and an increase in power generation of 89% results in  supply costs 20% higher than the reference case.  6.6.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 3,400 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately Us$ 87 billion per year,  Us$ 2,570 billion more than in the reference scenario  (Us$ 835 billion). investments for the advanced scenario sum  up to Us$ 4,700 billion until 2050, on average Us$ 121 billion  per year. Under the reference scenario, the levels of  investment in conventional power plants add up to almost  64% while approximately 36% would be invested in  renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, middle  east would shift almost 93%/96% of the entire investment  towards renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030,  the fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be  focused mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 4,270 billion up to 2050, Us$ 109 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 170% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 4,570 billion, or  Us$ 117 billion per year. renewable energy sources would  then go on to produce electricity without any further fuel  costs beyond 2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue  to be a burden on national economies.    6.6.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 1% of middle east’s energy  demand for heating, the main contribution coming from the  use of biomass. dedicated support instruments are required  to ensure a dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 24% of middle east’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 78% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating and processes by 43 %  in 2050 (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of  improving living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.6.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in middle east over time. By 2030,  the continuing growth of solar collectors and a growing share  of geothermal and environmental heat as well as heat from  renewable hydrogen will reduce the dependence on fossil  fuels. the advanced scenario results in a complete  substitution of the remaining gas consumption by hydrogen  generated from renewable electricity.    6.6.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be redirected  towards new efficient technologies in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios and supplement other sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 430 billion  to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to 2050  (including investments for replacement after the economic  lifetime of the plants) - approximately Us$ 11 billion per year.  the advanced scenario assumes an equally ambitious  expansion of renewable technologies resulting in an average  investment of around Us$ 12 billion per year, while the main  strategy in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining  natural gas amounts with electricity, hydrogen or other  synthetic fuels.    6.6.8 transport  a key target in middle east is to introduce incentives for  people to drive smaller cars and buy new, more efficient  vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift transport use  to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in  the expanding urban areas. along with rising prices for fossil  fuels, these changes reduce the further growth in car sales  projected under the reference scenario. due to population  increase, gdP growth and higher living standards, energy  demand from the transport sector is expected to increase in  the reference scenario by around 140% to 12,680 PJ/a in  2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario, efficiency  measures and modal shifts will save 59% (7,530 PJ/a) in  2050 compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 63%  (7,950 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 8% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 40% (49% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,810 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario.    6.6.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst middle east’s emissions of co2 will double between 2012  and 2050 under the reference scenario, under the energy  [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from 1,670 million  tonnes in 2012 to 294 million tonnes in 2050. annual per capita  emissions will drop from 7.7 tonne to 0.8 tonne. in spite of the  abstinence of nuclear power production and increasing power  demand, co2 emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. in  the long run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable  electricity in vehicles strongly reduce emissions in the transport  sector as well. With a 32% share of co2, the Power generation  sector will be the largest source of emissions in 2050 in the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, middle east´s co2  emissions are 47% below 1990 levels in the energy [r]evolution  scenario while energy consumption is fully decarbonised in the  advanced case.  6.6.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.6.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 8% from today’s 28,270 PJ/a to around  26,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 55% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 58,000 PJ in 2050). due to additional conversion  losses, the advanced scenario results in a primary energy  consumption of around 27,300 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of  very efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to  replace oil based combustion engines. this leads to an  overall renewable primary energy share of 20% in 2030 and  66% in 2050 in the basic energy [r]evolution and of more  than 85% in 2050 in the advanced case (incl. non-energy  consumption). in contrast to the reference scenario, no new  nuclear power plants will be built in middle east in the energy  [r]evolution scenarios.    6.7.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for eastern europe/eurasia’s final energy demand.  these are shown in figure 6.7.1 for the reference and energy  [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 53% from the current  27,400 PJ/a to 41,800 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand decreases by 19%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  22,100 PJ/a by 2050 the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.7.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  1,250 tWh/a to 2,360 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 870 tWh/a.  6.7 eastern europe/eurasia  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  2,500 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 580 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 170 tWh for hydrogen and 150 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 11,700 PJ/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  reference scenario. as a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied with much lower future energy demand.  144      6.7.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuelfired  power plants as well. By 2050, 86% of the electricity  produced in eastern europe/eurasia will come from  renewable energy sources in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario. ‘new’ renewables – mainly wind, Pv, csP and  geothermal energy – will contribute 51% to the total  electricity generation. already by 2020 the share of renewable  electricity production will be 23% and 49% by 2030. the  installed capacity of renewables will reach about 460 gW in  2030 and 1,120 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 1,790 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.7.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in eastern europe/eurasia over time.  Up to 2020 wind, biomass and Pv will become the main  contributors to the growing market share. after 2020, the  continuing growth of wind, biomass and Pv will be  complemented by electricity from solar thermal, geothermal  and ocean energy. the energy [r]evolution scenarios will lead  to a high share of fluctuating power generation sources (Pv,  wind and ocean) of already 23% to 29% by 2030 and 52% to  61% by 2050. therefore, smart grids, demand side  management (dsm), energy storage capacities and other  options need to be expanded in order to increase the  flexibility of the power system for grid integration, load  balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.7.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.7.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared to  the reference scenario until 2020. this difference in full cost of  generation will be less than 0.2 Us$ct/kWh in both energy  [r]evolution scenarios, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because of  increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity generation  costs will become economically favourable before 2030 under  the energy [r]evolution scenarios. By 2050, the cost in the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario will be 2.2 Us$ct/kWh below  those in the reference case, in the advanced scenario the cost  will be equal to the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total electricity  supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 212 billion per year to more  than Us$ 379 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 326 billion in the basic and Us$ 566 billion in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.7.6 shows that both  energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with eastern  europe/eurasia´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise  energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are 14% lower in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario than  in the reference scenario despite a 5% increase in electricity  production. the advanced scenario with 100% renewable  power and an increase in power generation of 58% results in  supply costs 49% higher than the reference case.  6.7.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 2,970 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately Us$ 76 billion per year,  Us$ 1,690 billion more than in the reference scenario  (Us$ 1,280 billion). investments for the advanced scenario  add up to Us$ 4,390 billion until 2050, on average  Us$ 113 billion per year, including high investments in  additional power plants for the production of synthetic fuels.  Under the reference scenario, the levels of investment in  conventional power plants add up to almost 41% while  approximately 59% would be invested in renewable energies  and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, eastern  europe/eurasia would shift almost 97% of the entire  investment towards renewables and cogeneration. By 2030,  the fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be  focused mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 3,280 billion up to 2050, Us$ 84 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 190% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 3,540 billion, or Us$ 91 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.7.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 4% of eastern  europe/eurasia’s energy demand for heating, the main  contribution coming from the use of biomass. dedicated  support instruments are required to ensure a dynamic  development in particular for renewable technologies for  buildings and renewable process heat production. in the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, renewables already  provide 29% of eastern europe/eurasia’s total heat demand  in 2030 and 86% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 44% in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.7.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in eastern europe/eurasia over time.  Up to 2030 biomass remains the main contributor of the  growing market share. after 2030, the continuing growth of  solar collectors and a growing share of geothermal and  environmental heat as well as heat from renewable hydrogen  will further reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. the  advanced scenario results in a complete substitution of the  remaining gas consumption by hydrogen generated from  renewable electricity.    6.7.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around  Us$ 1,790 billion to be invested in renewable heating  technologies up to 2050 (including investments for  replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately Us$ 46 billion per year. the advanced  scenario assumes an even more ambitious expansion of  renewable technologies resulting in an average investment of  around Us$ 48 billion per year, while the main strategy in the  scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.    6.7.8 transport  a key target in eastern europe/eurasia is to introduce  incentives for people to drive smaller cars and buy new, more  efficient vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift  transport use to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses,  especially in the metropolitan areas. along with rising prices  for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the further growth in  car sales projected under the reference scenario. due to  population increase, gdP growth and higher living standards,  energy demand from the transport sector is expected to  increase in the reference scenario by around 38% to 8,310  PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  efficiency measures and modal shifts will save 49% (4,060  PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 59%  (4,880 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 13% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 51% (61% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the transport  sector. in 2050, up to 460 PJ/a of hydrogen is used in the  transport sector for the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario.    6.7.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst eastern europe/eurasia’s emissions of co2 will increase  by 31% between 2012 and 2050 under the reference  scenario, under the energy [r]evolution scenario they will  decrease from 2,710 million tonnes in 2012 to 317 million  tonnes in 2050. annual per capita emissions will drop from 8  tonne to 1 tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power  production and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will  decrease in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency  gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles  strongly reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 39% share of co2, the Power generation sector will be  the largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, eastern europe/eurasia´s co2  emissions are around 92% below 1990 levels in the energy  [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.7.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.7.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 29% from today’s 49,310 PJ/a to around  35,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 47% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 66,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results  due to additional conversion losses in a primary energy  consumption of around 39,700 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and oil  as fast as technically and economically possible by expansion of  renewable energies and a fast introduction of very efficient  vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil based  combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable primary  energy share of 25% in 2030 and 73% in 2050 in the basic  energy [r]evolution and of more than 91% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to the  reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be built in  eastern europe/eurasia in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.  152    6.8.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for india’s final energy demand. these are shown in  figure 6.8.1 for the reference and energy [r]evolution  scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total final energy  demand increases by 208% from the current 19,900 PJ/a to  61,200 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  final energy demand increases at a much lower rate by 79%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  35,600 PJ/a by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.8.2). total electricity demand will decrease from about  870 tWh/a to 4,920 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 1,080 tWh/a.  6.8 india  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  5,500 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 1,190 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 440 tWh for hydrogen and 540 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 6,200 PJ/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  reference scenario. as a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied with much lower future energy demand.    6.8.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. By 2050, 93% of the electricity  produced in india will come from renewable energy sources in  the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’ renewables –  mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy – will contribute  71% to the total electricity generation. already by 2020 the  share of renewable electricity production will be 23% and  56% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables will reach  about 770 gW in 2030 and 2,240 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 3,260 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.8.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in india over time. Up to 2020 wind  and Pv will become the main contributors to the growing  market share. after 2020, the continuing growth of wind and  Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar thermal,  geothermal and ocean energy. the energy [r]evolution  scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating power  generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already 38% to  47% by 2030 and 62% to 70% by 2050. therefore, smart  grids, demand side management (dsm), energy storage  capacities and other options need to be expanded in order to  increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.  156    6.8.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.8.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario until 2030. this difference in full  cost of generation will be about 0.1 Us$ct/kWh in the  advanced scenario, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because  of increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  starting in 2030 under the energy [r]evolution scenarios. By  2050, the cost will be 2.1/1.6 Us$ct/kWh, respectively, below  those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 84 billion per  year to more than Us$ 471 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 485 billion in the basic and Us$ 673 billion in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.8.6 shows  that both energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with  india´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are 3% higher than in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario  than in the reference scenario, despite a 19% increase in  electricity production. the advanced scenario with 100%  renewable power and an increase in power generation of 60%  results in supply costs 43% higher than the reference case.  6.8.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 5,370 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of the  plants) - approximately Us$ 138 billion per year, Us$ 3,110  billion more than in the reference scenario (Us$ 2,260 billion).  investments for the advanced scenario add up to Us$ 7,220  billion until 2050, on average Us$ 185 billion per year,  including high investments in additional power plants for the  production of synthetic fuels. Under the reference scenario,  the levels of investment in conventional power plants add up  to almost 72% while approximately 28% would be invested in  renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, india  would shift up to 95% of the entire investment towards  renewables and cogeneration. By 2030, the fossil fuel share  of power sector investment would be focused mainly on gas  power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 3,430 billion up to 2050, Us$ 88 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 110% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 3,720 billion, or Us$ 95 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.8.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 50% of india’s energy  demand for heat, the main contribution coming from the use  of biomass. dedicated support instruments are required to  ensure a dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 55% of india’s total heat demand  in 2030 and 87% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 25% in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.8.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in india over time. Up to 2030  biomass remains the main contributor of the growing market  share. after 2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors  and a growing share of geothermal and environmental heat as  well as heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the  dependence on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in  a complete substitution of the remaining gas consumption by  hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.    6.8.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around  Us$ 1,020 billion to be invested in renewable heating  technologies up to 2050 (including investments for  replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately Us$ 26 billion per year. the advanced  scenario assumes an even more ambitious expansion of  renewable technologies resulting in an average investment of  around Us$ 27 billion per year, while the main strategy in the  scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.      6.8.8 transport  in 2050, the car fleet in india will be significantly larger than  today. therefore a key target is the successful introduction of  highly efficient vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift  transport use to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses,  especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas. along  with rising prices for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the  further growth in car sales projected under the reference  scenario. due to population increase, gdP growth and higher  living standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to strongly increase in the reference scenario by  around 518% to 19,030 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, efficiency measures and modal shifts  will save 50% (9,530 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the  reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 64%  (12,100 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 5% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 38% (62% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,220 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario.  6    6.8.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst india’s emissions of co2 will increase by 248%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  1,950 million tonnes in 2012 to 780 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.6 tonne to 0.5  tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power production  and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will decrease  in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency gains and  the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles strongly  reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 34% share of co2, the transport sector will be the largest  source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario. By 2050, india´s co2 emissions are still 34% above  1990 levels in the energy [r]evolution scenario while energy  consumption is fully decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.8.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.8.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will increase by 58% from today’s 32,940 PJ/a to around  52,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 47% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 99,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results in  a primary energy consumption of around 51,300 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of  very efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to  replace oil based combustion engines. this leads to an  overall renewable primary energy share of 34% in 2030 and  74% in 2050 in the basic energy [r]evolution and of more  than 94% in 2050 in the advanced case (incl. non-energy  consumption). in contrast to the reference scenario, no new  nuclear power plants will be built in india in the energy  [r]evolution scenarios.    6.9.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for other asia’s final energy demand. these are  shown in figure 6.9.1 for the reference and energy  [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total  final energy demand increases by 118% from the current  23,000 PJ/a to 50,200 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand increases at a  much lower rate by 25% compared to current consumption  and is expected to reach 28,800 PJ/a by 2050. the  advanced scenario results in some additional reductions due  to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.9.2). total electricity demand will rise from about 1,080  tWh/a to 3,680 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 1,730 tWh/a.  6.9 other asia  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  4,000 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 680 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 630 tWh for hydrogen and 70 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are even larger than in  the electricity sector. Under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, consumption equivalent to about 6,100 PJ/a is  avoided through efficiency gains by 2050 compared to the  reference scenario. as a result of energy-related renovation  of the existing stock of residential buildings, the introduction  of low energy standards and ‘passive climatisation’ for new  buildings, as well as highly efficient air conditioning systems,  enjoyment of the same comfort and energy services will be  accompanied with much lower future energy demand.    6.9.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired  power plants as well. By 2050, 92% of the electricity  produced in other asia will come from renewable energy  sources in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’  renewables – mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy –  will contribute 73% to the total electricity generation. already  by 2020 the share of renewable electricity production will be  25% and 60% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables  will reach about 620 gW in 2030 and 1,930 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 2,450 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.9.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in other asia over time. Up to 2020  wind and Pv will become the main contributors to the  growing market share. after 2020, the continuing growth of  wind and Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar  thermal, geothermal and ocean energy. the energy  [r]evolution scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating  power generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already  33% to 34% by 2030 and 57% to 54% by 2050. therefore,  smart grids, demand side management (dsm), energy  storage capacities and other options need to be expanded in  order to increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.9.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.9.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  increases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario until 2030. this difference in full  cost of generation will be less than 0.1 Us$ct/kWh in the  basic energy [r]evolution and about 0.4 Us$ct/kWh in the  advanced scenario, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because  of increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  starting in 2030 under the energy [r]evolution scenarios. By  2050, the cost will be 2.3/1.4 Us$ct/kWh, respectively, below  those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 136 billion per  year to more than Us$ 488 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 450 billion in the basic and Us$ 634 billion in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.9.6 shows  that both energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with  other asia´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise  energy costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are 8% higher in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario than  in the reference scenario, due to a 12% increase in electricity  production. the advanced scenario with 100% renewable  power and an increase in power generation of 44% results in  supply costs 30% higher than the reference case.  6.9.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 5,020 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of  the plants) - approximately Us$ 129 billion per year,  Us$ 3,250 billion more than in the reference scenario  (Us$ 1,770 billion). investments for the advanced scenario  add up to Us$ 6,270 billion until 2050, on average  Us$ 161 billion per year, including high investments in  additional power plants for the production of synthetic fuels.  Under the reference scenario, the levels of investment in  conventional power plants add up to almost 57% while  approximately 43% would be invested in renewable energies  and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, other asia  would shift almost 93%/95% of the entire investment towards  renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030, the  fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be focused  mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 3,810 billion up to 2050, Us$ 98 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 120% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 4,010 billion, or  Us$ 103 billion per year. renewable energy sources would  then go on to produce electricity without any further fuel  costs beyond 2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue  to be a burden on national economies.    6.9.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 42% of other asia’s energy  demand for heat, the main contribution coming from the use  of biomass. dedicated support instruments are required to  ensure a dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 56% of other asia’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 86% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 28 % in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.9.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in other asia over time. Up to 2030  biomass remains the main contributor of the growing market  share. after 2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors  and a growing share of geothermal and environmental heat as  well as heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the  dependence on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in  a complete substitution of the remaining gas consumption by  hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.    6.9.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 1,490  billion to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to  2050 (including investments for replacement after the  economic lifetime of the plants) - approximately Us$ 38  billion per year. the advanced scenario assumes an even  more ambitious expansion of renewable technologies  resulting in an average investment of around Us$ 41 billion  per year, while the main strategy in the scenario is the  substitution of the remaining natural gas amounts with  hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.    6.9.8 transport  in 2050, the car fleet in other asia will be significantly larger  than today. therefore a key target is the successful  introduction of highly efficient vehicle concepts. in addition, it  is vital to shift transport use to efficient modes like rail, light  rail and buses, especially in the expanding large metropolitan  areas. along with rising prices for fossil fuels, these changes  reduce the further growth in car sales projected under the  reference scenario. due to population increase, gdP growth  and higher living standards, energy demand from the  transport sector is expected to strongly increase in the  reference scenario by around 108% to 12,220 PJ/a in 2050.  in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario, efficiency measures  and modal shifts will save 49% (5,940 PJ/a) in 2050  compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 57%  (6,920 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 7% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 36% (46% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,750 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario.    6.9.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst other asia’s emissions of co2 will increase by 173%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  1,740 million tonnes in 2012 to 338 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 1.6 tonne to  0.2 tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power  production and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will  decrease in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency  gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles  strongly reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 39% share of co2, the industry sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, other asia´s co2 emissions  are around 52% below 1990 levels in the energy [r]evolution  scenario while energy consumption is fully decarbonised in  the advanced case.  6.9.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.9.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will increase by 29% from today’s 35,530 PJ/a to around  46,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 43% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 80,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results  due to additional conversion losses in a primary energy  consumption of around 46,900 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of very  efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil  based combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable  primary energy share of 43% in 2030 and 79% in 2050 in the  basic energy [r]evolution and of more than 91% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to  the reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be  built in other asia in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.    6.10.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for china’s final energy demand. these are shown  in figure 6.10.1 for the reference and energy [r]evolution  scenarios. Under the reference scenario, total final energy  demand increases by 70% from the current 65,900 PJ/a to  111,800 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario, final energy demand decreases by 7% compared to  current consumption and is expected to reach 61,000 PJ/a  by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some additional  reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.10.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  4,170 tWh/a to 8,730 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 4,760 tWh/a.  6.10 china  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  9,200 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 1,710 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 500 tWh for hydrogen and 950 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are very large as well.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, consumption  equivalent to about 15,500 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency  gains by 2050 compared to the reference scenario. as a  result of energy-related renovation of the existing stock of  residential buildings, the introduction of low energy standards  and ‘passive climatisation’ for new buildings, as well as highly  efficient air conditioning systems, enjoyment of the same  comfort and energy services will be accompanied with much  lower future energy demand.    6.10.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of  nuclear power production in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios, continuously reducing the number of fossil fuelfired  power plants as well. By 2050, 87% of the electricity  produced in china will come from renewable energy sources  in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’ renewables –  mainly wind, Pv, csP and geothermal energy – will contribute  58% to the total electricity generation. already by 2020 the  share of renewable electricity production will be 26% and  44% by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables will reach  about 1,520 gW in 2030 and 3,410 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 4,740 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.10.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in china over time. Up to 2020 wind  and Pv will become the main contributors to the growing  market share. after 2020, the continuing growth of wind and  Pv will be complemented by electricity from solar thermal,  geothermal and ocean energy. the energy [r]evolution  scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating power  generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already 21% to  23% by 2030 and up to 47% by 2050. therefore, smart grids,  demand side management (dsm), energy storage capacities  and other options need to be expanded in order to increase  the flexibility of the power system for grid integration, load  balancing and a secure supply of electricity.  176    6.10.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.10.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios  decreases the future costs of electricity generation compared  to the reference scenario already by 2020. this difference in  full cost of generation will be in 2030 already 1.0 Us$ct/kWh  in the basic energy [r]evolution and 0.6 Us$ct/kWh in the  advanced scenario, without taking into account integration  costs for storage or other load-balancing measures. Because  of increasing prices for conventional fuels, electricity  generation costs will become economically favourable  starting in 2020 under the energy [r]evolution scenarios. By  2050, the cost will be 1.5/0.2 Us$ct/kWh, respectively, below  those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 311 billion per  year to more than Us$ 1,125 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 813 billion in the basic and Us$ 1,268 billion in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.10.6 shows  that both energy [r]evolution scenarios not only comply with  china´s co2 reduction targets, but also help stabilise energy  costs and relieve the economic pressure on society.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term costs for electricity supply that  are more than 28% lower in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario than in the reference scenario. the advanced  scenario with 100% renewable power and an increase in  power generation of 10% results in supply costs 13% higher  than the reference case.  6.10.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 8,470 billion is required in investment for the  energy [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including  investments for replacement after the economic lifetime of the  plants) - approximately Us$ 217 billion per year, Us$ 3,130  billion more than in the reference scenario (Us$ 5,340 billion).  investments for the advanced scenario add up to Us$ 12,430  billion until 2050, on average Us$ 319 billion per year,  including high investments in additional power plants for the  production of synthetic fuels. Under the reference scenario,  the levels of investment in conventional power plants add up  to almost 49% while approximately 51% would be invested in  renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, china  would shift up to 95% of the entire investment towards  renewables and cogeneration, respectively. By 2030, the  fossil fuel share of power sector investment would be focused  mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 8,840 billion up to 2050, Us$ 227 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 280% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 9,610 billion, or Us$ 246  billion per year. renewable energy sources would then go on  to produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.10.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 19% of china’s energy  demand for heating, the main contribution coming from the  use of biomass. dedicated support instruments are required  to ensure a dynamic development in particular for renewable  technologies for buildings and renewable process heat  production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 34% of china’s total heat  demand in 2030 and 82% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 31% in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.10.2 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in china over time. Up to 2030  biomass remains the main contributor of the growing market  share. after 2030, the continuing growth of solar collectors  and a growing share of geothermal and environmental heat as  well as heat from renewable hydrogen will further reduce the  dependence on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in  a complete substitution of the remaining gas consumption by  hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.    6.10.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes - often traditional biomass today - will be  substantially reduced in the energy [r]evolution scenarios  and replaced by more efficient and sustainable renewable  heating technologies.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 3,310  billion to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to  2050 (including investments for replacement after the  economic lifetime of the plants) - approximately  Us$ 85 billion per year. the advanced scenario assumes an  even more ambitious expansion of renewable technologies  resulting in an average investment of around Us$ 86 billion  per year, while the main strategy in the scenario is the  substitution of the remaining natural gas amounts with  hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.  6,895 7,936 7,961  181  6.10.8 transport  in 2050, the car fleet in china will be significantly larger than  today. therefore a key target is the successful introduction of  highly efficient vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift  transport use to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses,  especially in the expanding large metropolitan areas. along  with rising prices for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the  further growth in car sales projected under the reference  scenario. due to population increase, gdP growth and higher  living standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to strongly increase in the reference scenario by  around 158% to 25,920 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, efficiency measures and modal shifts  will save 50% (12,860 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the  reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 61%  (15,940 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 8% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 46% (62% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the  transport sector. in 2050, up to 1,380 PJ/a of hydrogen is  used in the transport sector for the advanced energy  [r]evolution scenario.    6.10.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst china’s emissions of co2 will increase by 58%  between 2012 and 2050 under the reference scenario, under  the energy [r]evolution scenario they will decrease from  8,230 million tonnes in 2012 to 1,319 million tonnes in 2050.  annual per capita emissions will drop from 5.9 tonne to  0.9 tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear power  production and increasing power demand, co2 emissions will  decrease in the electricity sector. in the long run efficiency  gains and the increased use of renewable electricity in vehicles  strongly reduce emissions in the transport sector as well.  With a 40% share of co2, the industry sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, china´s co2 emissions are  around 42% below 1990 levels in the energy [r]evolution  scenario while energy consumption is fully decarbonised in  the advanced case.  6.10.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.10.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution] scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 20% from today’s 114,450 PJ/a to around  91,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 55% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 203,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results  due to additional conversion losses in a primary energy  consumption of around 95,300 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of very  efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to replace oil  based combustion engines. this leads to an overall renewable  primary energy share of 23% in 2030 and 71% in 2050 in the  basic energy [r]evolution and of more than 92% in 2050 in the  advanced case (incl. non-energy consumption). in contrast to  the reference scenario, no new nuclear power plants will be  built in china in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.    6.11.1 final energy demand by sector  combining the projections on population development, gdP  growth and energy intensity results in future development  pathways for oecd asia oceania’s final energy demand.  these are shown in figure 6.11.1 for the reference and  energy [r]evolution scenarios. Under the reference scenario,  total final energy demand increases by 2% from the current  20,100 PJ/a to 20,600 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario, final energy demand decreases by 43%  compared to current consumption and is expected to reach  11,500 PJ/a by 2050. the advanced scenario results in some  additional reductions due to a higher share of electric cars.  Under both energy [r]evolution scenarios, due to economic  growth, increasing living standards and electrification of the  transport sector, overall electricity demand is expected to  increase despite efficiency gains in all sectors (see figure  6.11.2). total electricity demand will rise from about  1,650 tWh/a to 1,720 tWh/a by 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. compared to the reference scenario,  efficiency measures in the industry, residential and service  sectors avoid the generation of about 940 tWh/a.  6.11 oecd asia oceania  this reduction can be achieved in particular by introducing  highly efficient electronic devices using the best available  technology in all demand sectors. the transformation to a  carbon free energy system in the advanced scenario will  further increase the electricity demand in 2050 up to  1,900 tWh/a. electricity will become the major renewable  ‘primary’ energy, not only for direct use for various purposes  but also for the generation of synthetic fuels for fossil fuels  substitution. around 330 tWh are used in 2050 for electric  vehicles and rail transport in 2050 in the advanced scenario,  around 210 tWh for hydrogen and 220 tWh for synthetic liquid  fuel generation for the transport sector (excluding bunkers).  efficiency gains in the heating sector are large as well. Under  the energy [r]evolution scenarios, consumption equivalent to  about 3,000 PJ/a is avoided through efficiency gains by 2050  compared to the reference scenario. as a result of energyrelated  renovation of the existing stock of residential  buildings, the introduction of low energy standards and  ‘passive climatisation’ for new buildings, as well as highly  efficient air conditioning systems, enjoyment of the same  comfort and energy services will be accompanied by much  lower future energy demand.    6.11.2 electricity generation  the development of the electricity supply sector is  characterised by a dynamically growing renewable energy  market and an increasing share of renewable electricity. this  trend will more than compensate for the phasing out of nuclear  power production in the energy [r]evolution scenarios,  continuously reducing the number of fossil fuel-fired power  plants as well. By 2050, 95% of the electricity produced in  oecd asia oceania will come from renewable energy sources  in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario. ‘new’ renewables –  mainly wind, Pv, ocean and geothermal energy – will contribute  76% to the total electricity generation. already by 2020 the  share of renewable electricity production will be 28% and 58%  by 2030. the installed capacity of renewables will reach about  550 gW in 2030 and 870 gW by 2050.  a 100% electricity supply from renewable energy resources in  the advanced scenario leads to around 1,250 gW installed  generation capacity in 2050.  table 6.11.1 shows the comparative evolution of the different  renewable technologies in oecd asia oceania over time.  Until 2020 hydro will remain the main renewable power  source. after 2020, the continuing growth of wind and Pv will  be complemented by electricity from solar thermal,  geothermal and ocean energy. the energy [r]evolution  scenarios will lead to a high share of fluctuating power  generation sources (Pv, wind and ocean) of already 35% to  40% by 2030 and 61% to 66% by 2050. therefore, smart  grids, demand side management (dsm), energy storage  capacities and other options need to be expanded in order to  increase the flexibility of the power system for grid  integration, load balancing and a secure supply of electricity.    6.11.3 future costs of electricity generation  figure 6.11.6 shows that the introduction of renewable  technologies under both energy [r]evolution scenarios increases  the future costs of electricity generation compared to the  reference scenario until 2030. this difference in full cost of  generation will be less than 1.8 Us$ct/kWh in the basic energy  [r]evolution and about 2.1 Us$ct/kWh in the advanced scenario,  without taking into account integration costs for storage or other  load-balancing measures. Because of increasing prices for  conventional fuels and the lower co2 intensity of electricity  generation, electricity generation costs will become economically  favourable after 2040 under the energy [r]evolution scenarios.  By 2050, the cost will be 3.1/2.7 Us$ct/kWh, respectively, below  those in the reference case.  Under the reference scenario, on the other hand, growth in  demand and increasing fossil fuel prices result in total  electricity supply costs rising from today’s Us$ 183 billion per  year to more than Us$ 302 billion in 2050, compared to  Us$ 212 billion in the basic and Us$ 301 billion in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. figure 6.11.6 shows  that both energy [r]evolution scenarios will help to comply  with oecd asia oceania´s co2 reduction targets, and  eventually will also help to stabilise energy costs.  increasing energy efficiency and shifting energy supply to  renewables lead to long term investment costs for electricity  supply that are more than 30% lower in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario than in the reference scenario. the  advanced scenario with 100% renewable power and an  increase in power generation of 24% results in supply costs  similar to the reference case.  6.11.4 future investments in the power sector  around Us$ 3,120 billion is required in investment for the energy  [r]evolution scenario to become reality (including investments  for replacement after the economic lifetime of the plants) -  approximately Us$ 80 billion per year, Us$ 650 billion more than  in the reference scenario (Us$ 2,480 billion). investments for  the advanced scenario sum up to Us$ 3,950 billion until 2050,  on average Us$ 101 billion per year. Under the reference  scenario, the levels of investment in conventional power plants  add up to almost 62% while approximately 38% would be  invested in renewable energies and cogeneration until 2050.  Under the energy [r]evolution scenarios, however, oecd  asia oceania would shift almost 88%/90% of the entire  investment towards renewables and cogeneration,  respectively. By 2030, the fossil fuel share of power sector  investment would be focused mainly on gas power plants.  Because renewable energy has no fuel costs, the fuel cost  savings in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario reach a total  of Us$ 2,170 billion up to 2050, Us$ 56 billion per year. the  total fuel cost savings therefore would cover 330% of the  total additional investments compared to the reference  scenario. fuel cost savings in the advanced scenario are  even higher and add up to Us$ 2,400 billion, or Us$ 62 billion  per year. renewable energy sources would then go on to  produce electricity without any further fuel costs beyond  2050, while costs for coal and gas will continue to be a  burden on national economies.    6.11.5 energy supply for heating  today, renewables meet around 5% of oecd asia oceania’s  energy demand for heating, the main contribution coming  from the use of biomass. dedicated support instruments are  required to ensure a dynamic development in particular for  renewable technologies for buildings and renewable process  heat production. in the basic energy [r]evolution scenario,  renewables already provide 35% of oecd asia oceania’s  total heat demand in 2030 and 93% in 2050.  • energy efficiency measures help to reduce the currently  growing energy demand for heating by 34% in 2050  (relative to the reference scenario), in spite of improving  living standards and economic growth.  • in the industry sector solar collectors, geothermal energy  (incl. heat pumps) as well as electricity and hydrogen from  renewable sources are increasingly substituting for fossil  fuel-fired systems.  • a shift from coal and oil to natural gas in the remaining  conventional applications leads to a further reduction of  co2 emissions.  table 6.11.8 shows the development of different renewable  technologies for heating in oecd asia oceania over time.  Biomass remains the main contributor, with increasing  investments in highly efficient modern biomass technology.  after 2030, a massive growth of solar collectors and a  growing share of geothermal and environmental heat as well  as heat from renewable hydrogen can further reduce the  dependence on fossil fuels. the advanced scenario results in  a complete substitution of the remaining gas consumption by  hydrogen generated from renewable electricity.    6.11.6 future investments in the heating sector  also in the heating sector the energy [r]evolution scenarios  would require a major revision of current investment  strategies in heating technologies. in particular, solar thermal,  geothermal and heat pump technologies need an enormous  increase in installations if these potentials are to be tapped  for the heating sector. the use of biomass for heating  purposes will shift from often traditional biomass today to  modern, efficient and environmentally friendly heating  technologies in the energy [r]evolution scenarios.  renewable heating technologies are extremely variable, from  low tech biomass stoves and unglazed solar collectors to  very sophisticated enhanced geothermal and solar systems.  thus, it can only be roughly estimated that the energy  [r]evolution scenario in total requires around Us$ 720 billion  to be invested in renewable heating technologies up to 2050  (including investments for replacement after the economic  lifetime of the plants) - approximately Us$ 18 billion per year.  the advanced scenario assumes an equally ambitious  expansion of renewable technologies assuming a slightly  higher share of direct electric heating, while the main strategy  in the scenario is the substitution of the remaining natural gas  amounts with electricity, hydrogen or other synthetic fuels.    6.11.8 transport  a key target in oecd asia oceania is to introduce incentives  for people to drive smaller cars and buy new, more efficient  vehicle concepts. in addition, it is vital to shift transport use  to efficient modes like rail, light rail and buses, especially in  the expanding large metropolitan areas. along with rising  prices for fossil fuels, these changes reduce the further  growth in car sales projected under the reference scenario.  despite population increase, gdP growth and higher living  standards, energy demand from the transport sector is  expected to decrease in the reference scenario by around  25% to 4,400 PJ/a in 2050. in the basic energy [r]evolution  scenario, efficiency measures and modal shifts will save 40%  (1,780 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  additional modal shifts and technology switches lead to even  higher energy savings in the advanced scenario of 50%  (2,180 PJ/a) in 2050 compared to the reference scenario.  Highly efficient propulsion technology with hybrid, plug-in  hybrid and battery-electric power trains will bring about large  efficiency gains. By 2030, electricity will provide 12% of the  transport sector’s total energy demand in the energy  [r]evolution, while in 2050 the share will be 45% (53% in the  advanced scenario). Hydrogen and other synthetic fuels  generated using renewable electricity are complementary  options to further increase the renewable share in the transport  sector. in 2050, up to 580 PJ/a of hydrogen is used in the  transport sector for the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario.    6.11.10 development of co2 emissions  Whilst oecd asia oceania’s emissions of co2 will decrease  by 22% between 2012 and 2050 under the reference  scenario, under the energy [r]evolution scenario they will  decrease from 2,210 million tonnes in 2012 to 85 million  tonnes in 2050. annual per capita emissions will drop from  10.9 tonne to 0.4 tonne. in spite of the abstinence of nuclear  power production and increasing power demand, co2  emissions will decrease in the electricity sector. in the long  run efficiency gains and the increased use of renewable  electricity in vehicles strongly reduce emissions in the  transport sector as well.  With a 29% share of co2, the industry sector will be the  largest source of emissions in 2050 in the basic energy  [r]evolution scenario. By 2050, oecd asia oceania´s co2  emissions are around 95% below 1990 levels in the energy  [r]evolution scenario while energy consumption is fully  decarbonised in the advanced case.  6.11.11 primary energy consumption  taking into account the assumptions discussed above, the  resulting primary energy consumption under the energy  [r]evolution scenarios is shown in figure 6.11.12. Under the  basic energy [r]evolution scenario, primary energy demand  will decrease by 47% from today’s 35,800 PJ/a to around  19,000 PJ/a. compared to the reference scenario, overall  primary energy demand will be reduced by 48% in 2050  under the energy [r]evolution scenario (reference scenario:  around 36,000 PJ in 2050). the advanced scenario results  due to additional conversion losses in a primary energy  consumption of around 20,900 PJ in 2050.  the energy [r]evolution scenarios aim to phase out coal and  oil as fast as technically and economically possible by  expansion of renewable energies and a fast introduction of  very efficient vehicle concepts in the transport sector to  replace oil based combustion engines. this leads to an  overall renewable primary energy share of 35% in 2030 and  81% in 2050 in the basic energy [r]evolution and of more  than 89% in 2050 in the advanced case (incl. non-energy  consumption). in contrast to the reference scenario, no new  nuclear power plants will be built in oecd asia oceania in the  energy [r]evolution scenarios.    e m p loy m e n t p r o j e ct i o n s -  m e t h o d o lo gy a n d a s s u m p t i o n s  image hundreds of salt lakes are sprinkled across the landscape of northern and western australia. most, including lake mackay, fill infrequently via seasonal rainfall that runs off  of nearby lands and through minor drainage channels. water can persist in lake mackay for at least six months after a flood; when it does, the ephemeral lake provides an important  habitat and breeding area for shorebirds and waterbirds  employment factors regional adjustments  just transition:  investment in  education rather  than fossil fuels”  “    the institute for sustainable futures at the University of  technology sydney modelled the effects of the reference  scenario and advanced energy {r]evolution scenario on jobs  in the energy sector. this section provides a simplified  overview of how the calculations were performed. a detailed  methodology is also available.1 chapters 6 and 7 contain all  the data on how the scenarios were developed. the main  inputs to the calculations are:  for each scenario, namely the reference (business as usual)  and advanced energy [r]evolution scenario:  • the amount of electrical and heating capacity that will be  installed each year for each technology.  • the primary energy demand for coal, gas, and biomass  fuels in the electricity and heating sectors.  • the amount of electricity generated per year from nuclear,  oil, and diesel.  for each technology:  • employment factors’, or the number of jobs per unit of capacity,  separated into manufacturing, construction, operation and  maintenance, and per unit of primary energy for fuel supply.  • for the 2020, 2025, and 2030 calculations, a ‘decline factor’  for each technology which reduces the employment factors by  a certain percentage per year. this reflects the fact that  employment per unit falls as technology efficiencies improve.  for each region:  • the percentage of local manufacturing and domestic fuel  production in each region, in order to calculate the  proportion of manufacturing and fuel production jobs which  occur in the region.  • the percentage of world trade which originates in each region  for coal and gas fuels, and renewable traded components.  • a “regional job multiplier”, which indicates how labour-intensive  economic activity is in that region compared to  the oecd. this is used to adjust oecd employment  factors where local data is not available.  the electrical capacity increase and energy use figures from  each scenario are multiplied by the employment factors for  each of the technologies, and then adjusted for regional labour  intensity and the proportion of fuel or manufacturing which  occurs locally. the calculation is summarised in the figure 7.1.    [number of years after 2015]  a range of data sources are used for the model inputs,  including the international energy agency, Us energy  information administration, BP statistical review of World  energy, Us national renewable energy laboratory,  international labour organisation, World Bank, industry  associations, national statistics, company reports, academic  literature, and isf’s own research.  these calculations only take into account direct  employment, for example the construction team needed to  build a new wind farm. they do not cover indirect  employment, for example the extra services provided in a  town to accommodate the construction team.  the calculations do not include jobs in energy efficiency,  although these are likely to be substantial, as the energy  [r]evolution leads to a 34% drop in primary energy demand  in the heating and electricity sectors at 2030.  the large number of assumptions required to make  calculations mean that employment numbers are indicative  only, especially for regions where little data exists. However,  within the limits of data availability, the figures presented are  representative of employment levels under the two scenarios.  7.1 employment factors  “employment factors” are used to calculate how many jobs  are required per unit of electrical or heating capacity, or per  unit of fuel. they take into account jobs in manufacturing,  construction, operation and maintenance and fuel. table 7.1  lists the employment factors used in the calculations. these  factors are usually from oecd countries, as this is where  there is most data, although local factors are used wherever  possible. for job calculations in non oecd regions, a regional  adjustment is used where a local factor is not available.  employment factors were derived for every region for coal  supply, because coal is currently so dominant in the global  energy supply, and because employment per tonne varies so  much by region. in australia and the Us coal is extracted at  an average of more than 8,000 tonnes3 per person per year,  while in europe the average coal miner is responsible for less  than 1,000 tonnes per year. india, china, and eastern  europe/eurasia have relatively low productivity at present,  with 600-700 tonnes per worker per year, but annual  increases in productivity are very high. the projections in coal  mining employment take into account the trend in  196      productivity in india, china, and russia. data for the the last  7 to 15 years were used to calculate an annual improvement  trend, which has been used to derive an annual percentage  reduction in the employment factors for coal mining over the  study period.  local data is also used for gas extraction for every region  except india, the middle east and other (non-oecd) asia.  the calculation of coal and gas employment per PJ draws on  data from national statistics and company reports, combined  with production figures from the BP statistical review of  World energy 20154 or other sources. data was collected for  as many major coal producing countries as possible,with  coverage obtained for 90% of world coal production  7.2 regional adjustments  7.2.1 regional job multipliers  the employment factors used in this model for energy  technologies other than coal mining are most often for oecd  regions, which are typically wealthier. a regional multiplier is  applied to make the jobs per mW more realistic for other parts  of the world. in developing countries it typically means more  jobs per unit of electricity because those countries have more  labour intensive practices. the multipliers change over the  study period in line with the projections for gdP per worker.  this reflects the fact that as prosperity increases, labour  intensity tends to fall. the multipliers are shown in table 7.3.  7.2.2 local employment factors  local employment factors are used where possible. region  specific factors are:  • oecd north america: gas and coal fuel, Pv and offshore wind  (all factors), and solar thermal power (construction and o&m).  • other europe: gas and coal fuel, offshore wind (all factors), solar  thermal power (construction and o&m), and solar heating.  • oecd asia oceania: gas and coal fuel.  • africa: gas, coal and biomass fuel.  • china: gas and coal fuel, and solar heating.  • eastern europe/eurasia: gas and coal fuel.  • other (non-oecd) asia: coal fuel.  • india: coal fuel, and solar heating.  • latin america: coal and biomass fuels, onshore wind (all  factors), nuclear (construction and o&m), large hydro  (o&m) and small hydro (construction and o&m).    local manufacturing and fuel production  some regions do not manufacture the equipment needed for  installation of renewable technologies, for example wind  turbines or solar Pv panels. the model takes into account a  projection of the percentage of renewable technology which  is made locally. the jobs in manufacturing components for  export are counted in the region where they originate. the  same applies to coal and gas fuels, because they are traded  internationally, so the model shows the region where the jobs  are actually located.  learning adjustments or ‘decline factors’  these account for the projected reduction in the cost of  renewable over time, as technologies and companies become  more efficient and production processes are scaled up.  generally, jobs per mW would fall in parallel with this trend. the  cost projections for each region in the energy [r]evolution  scenarios have been used to derive these factors.  198    7  199  7.3 employment results by technology  7.3.1 employment in fossil fuels and nuclear energy  employment in coal  Jobs in the coal sector drop significantly in both the  reference scenario and the advanced energy [r]evolution  scenario. in the reference scenario coal employment drops  by 2 million jobs between 2020 and 2030, despite generation  from coal nearly doubling. coal employment in 2015 was  close to 9.8 million, so this is in addition to a loss of 0.1  million jobs from 2015 to 2020.  this is because employment per ton in coal mining is falling  dramatically as efficiencies increase around the world. for  example, one worker in the new chinese ‘super mines’ is  expected to produce 30,000 tonnes of coal per year,  compared to current average productivity across all mines in  china of about 600 tonnes per year, and average productivity  per worker in north america of close to 9,000 tonnes.  Unsurprisingly, employment in the coal sector in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario falls even more between 2020  and 2030, reflecting reduction in coal generation from 34% to  16% of all generation, on top of the increase in efficiency.  coal jobs in both scenarios include coal used for heat supply.  employment in gas, oil & diesel  employment in the gas, oil and diesel sectors increases by  12% in the reference scenario, despite corresponding  generation in gas, oil and diesel increasing by 29%. this  reflects increasing efficiencies in the sector. in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario, employment and generation  remains relatively stable, just above 2015 levels. gas sector  jobs in both scenarios include heat supply jobs from gas.  employment in nuclear energy  employment in nuclear energy falls by 15% in the reference  scenario between 2020 and 2030, while generation increases  by 14%. in the advanced energy [r]evolution generation is  reduced by 70% between 2020 and 2030, representing a  virtual phase out of nuclear power. employment in the energy  [r]evolution scenario increases slightly, and in 2020 and 2030  is very similar in both scenarios. this is because jobs in  nuclear decommissioning replace jobs in generation. it is  expected these jobs will persist for 20 - 30 years.  energy    7.3.2 employment in wind energy and biomass  employment in wind energy  in the advaced energy [r]evolution scenario, wind energy  provides 21% of total electricity generation by 2030, and  employs 8.2 million people. growth is much more modest in  the reference scenario, with wind energy providing 5% of  generation, and employing only 0.6 million people.  employment in biomass  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, biomass  provides 5.4% of total electricity generation by 2030, and  employs 11.5 million people. in the reference scenario,  biomass provides a smaller share of electricity, (2.9%), but  employs 11.8 million people, sllightly more than in the  advanced energy [r]evolution scenario. Jobs in heating from  biomass fuels are also included here.  200      7.3.3 employment in geothermal and wave power  employment in geothermal power  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, geothermal  power would provide 2% of total electricity generation by 2030,  and would employ 386 thousand people. Growth is much more  modest in the reference scenario, with geothermal power  providing less than 1% of generation, and employing only 34  thousand people.  employment in wave and tidal power  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, wave and tidal  power would provide 1% of total electricity generation by  2030, and would employ 652 thousand people. Growth is  much more modest in the reference scenario, with wave and  tidal power providing less than 0.1% of generation, and  employing only 14 thousand people.    652  7.3.4 employment in solar photovoltaics and solar  thermal power  employment in solar photovoltaics  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, solar  photovoltaic would provide 14% of total electricity generation  by 2030, and would employ 10.3 million people. Growth is  much more modest in the reference scenario, with solar  photovoltaic providing less than 2% of generation, and  employing only 0.7 million people.  employment in solar thermal power  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, solar thermal  power would provide 7% of total electricity generation by  2030, and would employ 2.7 million people. Growth is much  lower in the reference scenario, with solar thermal power  providing only 0.2% of generation, and employing only  80 thousand people.  202    7    7.3.5 employment in the renewable heating sector  employment in the renewable heating sector  employment in the renewable heat sector includes jobs in  installation, manufacturing, and fuel supply. this analysis  includes only jobs associated with fuel supply in the biomass  sector, and jobs in installation and manufacturing for direct  heat from solar, geothermal and heat pumps. it is therefore  likely to be an underestimate of jobs in this sector.  employment in solar heating  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, solar heating  would provide 9% of total heat supply by 2030, and would  employ 5.6 million people. Growth is much more modest in  the reference scenario, with solar heating providing just over  1% of heat suuply, and employing only 0.3 million people.  employment in geothermal and heat pump heating  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, geothermal  and heat pump heating would provide 7% of total heat supply  by 2030, and would employ 1.5 million people. Growth is  much more modest in the reference scenario, with  geothermal and heat pump heating providing less than 1% of  heat supply, and employing only 37 thousand people.  employment in biomass heat  in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, biomass heat  would provide 24% of total heat supply by 2030, and would  employ 5.5 million people. Growth is slightly less in the  reference scenario, with biomass heat providing 18% of heat  supply, and employing 5.1 million people.    t h e s i l e n t e n e r gy m a r k e t [ r ] e v o lu t i o n  image tunisia’s second largest city, sfax. sfax is a major port and home to tunisia’s largest fishing fleet. the most recognizable features of sfax from space are the brilliantly colored  salt ponds south of the old city and the new circular earth works of the taparura redevelopment project just to the north.  the power plant  market 1970 to 2014  the global market shares  in the power plant market:  renewables gaining ground  the first decade:  the development of the  renewable power plant market  the global renewable  energy market in 2014  renewables  gained the  largest market  share in 2014”  “    8.1 the power plant market 1970 to 2011  an analysis of the global power plant market of the past 45  years shows that since the late 1990s, wind and solar  installations grew faster than any other power plant  technology across the world - about 533,000 mW total  capacity between 2000 and 2014. including all other  renewable power technologies (hydro, biomass,  concentrated solar and geothermal), a total of 894,000 mW  of new capacity has been connected to the grid. however, it  is too early to claim the end of the fossil fuel based power  generation, because during the same timeframe, almost the  same amount of new coal power plants – approx. 840,000  mW – were built with embedded cumulative emissions of  around 100 billion tonnes co2 over their technical lifetime.  the global market volume of renewable energy in 2014 was,  for the first time ever, higher than the global net addition of  fossil fuel capacity (ren21-2015).1 there is a window of  opportunity for new renewable energy installations to replace  old plants in oecd countries and for electrification in  developing countries. however, the window will close within  the next few years without good renewable energy policies –  especially in regard to priority grid access and dispatching -  and legally binding co2 reduction targets.  between 1970 and 1990, the global power plant market in the  oecd2 was dominated by countries that electrified their  economies mainly with coal, gas and hydro power plants. the  power sector was largely in the hands of state-owned and  investor owned utilities with regional or nationwide supply  monopolies. the nuclear industry had a relatively short period of  steady growth between 1970 and the mid-1980s - with a peak  in 1985, one year before the chernobyl accident - and went into  decline in following years, with no signs of growth since then.  between 1990 and 2000, the global power plant industry  went through a series of changes. While oecd countries  began to liberalise their electricity markets, electricity  demand did not match previous growth, so fewer new power  plants were built. capital-intensive projects with long  payback times, such as coal and nuclear power plants, were  unable to get sufficient financial support. it was the decade of  gas power plants.    the economies of developing countries, especially in asia,  started growing during the 1990s, triggering a new wave of  power plant projects. similarly to the us and europe, most of  the new markets in the ‘tiger states’ of southeast asia partly  deregulated their power sectors. a large number of new  power plants in this region were built by independent power  producer (ipps), who sell the electricity mainly to stateowned  utilities. the majority of new power plant technology in  liberalised power markets is fuelled by gas except in china,  which focused on building new coal power plants. about 75%  of all new coal power plants worldwide between 2000 and  2014 were built in china. in 2014, the first signs that the end  of aggressive coal expansion might end appeared: the  national bureau of statics of china (nbsc 2015)3 revealed  that the thermal power generation in the first quarter of 2015  was down 3.7%, hydropower generation up 17% and “other”  power generation (mainly wind, solar and nuclear) was up  18% on year. total energy consumption only grew 1% and  total electricity consumption was stable. furthermore, gasfired  capacity grew by 20% during 2014, and coal-power  generation fell more than 4%; the overall coal consumption  for the power sector declined by as much as 5%.    8.1.1 power plant markets in the us, europe and china  the graphs show how much electricity market liberalisation  influences the choice of power plant technology. While the us  and european power sectors moved towards deregulated  markets, which favour mainly gas power plants and  increasingly onshore wind, china added large quantities of  power generation capacities of various technologies. besides  coal, there was a double digit GW market volume (over  10,000 mW of new capacity per year) for wind and hydro and  – since 2013 – solar photovoltaics as well. china was the  largest market for pv installations in 2013 and 2014 with no  signs of decline in the near future.  Us: liberalisation of the us power sector started with the  energy policy act 1992 and became a game changer for the  whole sector. in 2015, the us in is still far away from a fully  liberalised electricity market, but the effect has been a shift  from coal and nuclear towards gas and wind, with a slowly  but steadily growing solar photovoltaic market. the economic  backbone of the growing onshore wind market has been the  Production Tax Credit (ptc) during the past years. the  federal renewable electricity production tax credit (ptc) is a  per-kWh tax credit for electricity generated by qualified  energy resources and sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated  person during the taxable year. originally enacted in 1992,  the ptc has been changed numerous times, most recently in  january 2013 (usa – energy.gov 2015).4  the impact of the ptc on the usa wind market is significant.  the united states ranked third for global wind market  additions (nearly 4.9 GW), second for cumulative capacity at  year’s end (65.9 GW), and first for wind power generation  (181.8 tWh) during 2014. the us market rebounded with a  record 13 GW under construction as of early 2015. texas led  for capacity added (more than 1.8 GW), followed by  oklahoma, iowa, Washington, and colorado. the federal  ptc, which expired at the end of 2013, was reinstated  retroactively in mid-december 2014. the solar photovoltaic  market grows mainly due because grid parity has been  reached. net-metering and gird connection regulations are of  vital importance for future solar growth.  references    europe: about five years after the us began deregulating the  power sector, the european community started a similar  process with similar effect on the power plant market.  investors backed fewer new power plants and extended the  lifetime of the existing ones. new coal and nuclear power  plants have had a market share of well below 10% for new  projects since then. the growing share of renewables,  especially wind and solar photovoltaics, is due to a legally  binding target and the associated feed-in laws in force in  many member states of the european community since the  late 1990s. overall, new installed power plant capacity  jumped to a record high because the aged power plant fleet  in europe needed re-powering. in 1997, the eu established a  renewable energy target of 20% by 2020. by mid-2015, it  had become clear that this target will be most likely reached  and that further energy policy changes – especially for  infrastructure – are required. europe´s grid infrastructure and  many power plants are ageing, and major investment  decisions are being taken. in october 2014, eu leaders  agreed on rather low renewable energy and energy efficiency  targets for 2030. the target for a minimum 27 per cent share  of renewables across europe ignores the potential for  renewables to supply almost half of europe’s energy by 2030  and might have a negative impact of the future renewable  power market in europe.    china: the steady economic growth in china since the late  1990s and the growing power demand led to an explosion of  the coal power plant market, especially after 2002. in 2013,  the market hit a new peak year for new coal power plants:  75% of new coal power plants built worldwide since 2000  were in china. at the same time, china is trying to take its  dirtiest plants offline; between 2006 and 2010, a total of  76,825 mW of small coal power plants were phased out  under the 11th five year programme. While coal still  dominates new added capacity, wind power is rapidly  growing as well. starting in 2003, the wind market doubled  each year to over 18,000 mW5 by 2010, constituting 49% of  the global wind market. the chinese wind market declined to  12,960 mW in 2012 and increased again to 23,200 mW in  2014. hydro power plants maintain a large market share for  new installations: around 150,000 mW of new capacity has  been added, increasing the total installed capacity for hydro  to 280,000 mW in china. solar photovoltaic is starting to play  an increasing role with regard to newly installed capacity;  10,600 mW was added in 2014 alone; since 2011, china has  added the same capacity of pv as Germany – the world  leader – since 1994. future expansion of renewables  depends especially on grid regulation as access to the power  grid is the economic basis for renewables.  references  5 While the official statistic of the Global and chinese Wind industry associations (GWec/creia) adds up to  18,900 mW for 2010, the national enerGy bureau speaks about 13,999 mW. the differences betWeen sources  are due to the time of Grid connection, as some turbines Were installed in the last months of 2010 but  only connected to the Grid in 2011. these effects also miGht arise in the folloWinG year till 2014.    plant market: renewables gaining ground  since 2000, the wind power market gained a growing market  share within the global power plant market. initially only a  handful of countries, namely Germany, denmark and spain,  dominated the wind market, but the wind industry now has  projects in over 100 countries around the world. the solar  photovoltaic industry has experienced similar growth since  2005. between 2000 and 2014, 38% of all new power plants  worldwide were renewable-powered – mainly wind (15.8%)  and pv (8.4%), while 22% were gas power plants and 34%  coal. thus around 60% of all new power plants installed  globally are gas power plants and renewable, with close to  one-third as coal. nuclear remains irrelevant on a global scale  with just 1% of the global market share for new builds.  the energy revolution has started on a global level already.  this picture becomes even clearer when we look into the  global market shares but exclude china, the only country with  a massive expansion of coal. about 43% of all new power  plants since 2000 have been renewables and 37% have been  gas power plants (80% gas + re in total). coal gained a  market share of only 12.5% globally, excluding china. the  usa and europe installed 44% and 59% of renewables,  respectively, and 44% and 36% of gas power plants since  2000. thus new renewables and gas power are the  dominating power generation technologies, replacing coal  and nuclear and putting both regions on a low-carbon  pathway.    8.3 the first decade: the development of the  renewable power plant market  the renewable energy network for the 21st century (ren21)  published its 10th in-depth analysis of the Global renewable  energy market analysis – “renewables 2015 – Global status  report” in june 2015. With the friendly permission of ren21,  this section summarize the main findings of this analysis with  regard to renewable power markets and their status in 2014.  8.3.1 the renewable power sector in 2014 -  ren21’s analysis  in 2014, most renewable energy projects were developed in  the power sector. including hydropower, which rose by 3.6  percent to around 1,055 GW, renewable electricity capacity  increased worldwide to approximately 1,712 GW by the end  of 2014. most of the growth came from non-hydro  renewables, which grew by almost 18 percent to an  estimated 660 GW. pv and wind posted record capacity  additions exceeding new hydropower; taken together, pv and  wind made up more than 90 percent of non-hydro added  capacity in 2014.  including fossil and nuclear additions, renewables still made  up around 59 percent of the global market, with several  countries posting far higher shares. by the end of 2014, 27.7  percent of global generation capacity was renewable, enough  to cover 22.8 percent of global power demand, 16.6 percent  of which was hydropower. renewable electricity production is  also growing faster than demand. from 2007-2012,  electricity consumption grew worldwide by 2.7 percent on  average, while renewable power generation increased at an  annual rate of 5.9 percent. While electricity consumption in  non-oecd countries grew twice as fast as that average,  these countries now make up roughly half of investments in  renewable energy.  variable renewables – pv and wind – have also reached high  levels of penetration in numerous countries. in 2014, wind power  covered 39 percent of power demand in denmark, 27 percent in  portugal, and 21 percent in nicaragua. the highest performers  with pv were italy at 7.9 percent of electricity demand, Greece  at 7.6 percent, and Germany at seven percent.  the leading countries for total installed renewable power  generation capacity at the end of 2014 were china, the  united states, brazil, Germany, and canada. roughly a  quarter of the world’s renewable power capacity was located  in china, including some 280 GW of hydropower. excluding  hydropower, the leading countries were china, the united  states, and Germany, followed by four countries roughly at  the same level: italy, spain, japan, and india. the top 20  countries for non-hydro renewable power capacity per capita  were all in europe. denmark was far and away the leader,  followed by Germany, sweden, spain, and portugal.  outside china – which added the most wind, solar, and  hydropower capacity of any country in the world – there was  significant market growth elsewhere in asia. for instance,  thailand added 0.5 GW of pv – more than many european  countries – and significant wind power capacity was built in  the philippines and pakistan.  renewables made up 78 percent of new generation capacity  in the european Union, roughly the level of the past seven  years. in Germany, the share of non-hydro renewable  electricity grew from 10.5 percent in 2010 to 24 percent in  2014. in scotland, renewables covered nearly half of  electricity demand.  in north america, pv and wind continued to grow strongly,  though the continent has hardly its tremendous resources.  more renewable generation capacity was built than gas  capacity in the us, and for the first time non-hydro resources  produced more electricity than hydropower.  brazil continues to be the leader with renewables in latin  america and the caribbean. more than 3 GW of hydropower  capacity was added in 2014 along with a record 2.5 GW of  wind power. but chile and mexico also ramped up wind and  pv significantly, while uruguay added the most wind power  capacity per capita worldwide.  in africa, south africa came in ninth worldwide for solar  markets, putting the continent in the top 10 for the first time  just ahead of india. south africa also led the continent in wind  installations. kenya built more than half of new global  geothermal capacity, and rwanda added at least 30 mW of  hydropower and an 8.5 mW pv plant.  in 2014, large renewable energy projects (more than one  megawatt) owned by utilities and key investors continued to  dominate global renewable energy production. but australia,  europe, japan, and north america have also witnessed  significant growth in “prosumers” – power consumers who  also produce their own electricity. national dialogues were  held in france on how to support and manage this growing  group, as did the european union. in both developed and  developing countries, industry also got a lot of the energy is  needed from biomass waste from agriculture and forestry.  development countries with quickly growing energy  consumption are developing renewables and fossil fuel  capacity simultaneously. in contrast, power consumption is  relatively stagnant in numerous oecd countries; they are,  renewable energy growth displaces existing generation.  some utilities and power providers in europe and north  america are therefore shedding fossil fuel investments and  taking on renewable energy assets – including acquiring other  utilities with such assets. some countries have passed laws  requiring utilities to come up with new business models and  upgrade grids for the integration of greater shares of  renewable electricity. india and africa in particular are  building transmission lines to areas with a lot of renewable  energy resources.    community energy co-ops also grew further in 2014,  especially for pv. the first community-owned ocean energy  system was built in scotland, and community projects have  also gone up from thailand to nova scotia. denmark and  Germany have the strongest tradition of local ownership of  renewable energy projects. as of 2012, 47 percent of  renewable energy investments came from citizens in  Germany, though that percentage has fallen since then.  in 2014, corporations and large institutions also increasingly  got on board. under the re100 initiative, a group of  companies pledged to reach 100 percent renewable energy.  the total amount that such firms independently invested in  renewables added up to billions of dollars. the mining  industry has also discovered renewable energy as a way of  reducing energy supply costs at remote locations. mines in  brazil, canada, chile, south africa, and tanzania now get  some of their heat and/or power from renewables.  traditional utilities are voluntarily purchasing renewable  energy, especially electricity, even outside of mandates. in  2013, Germany has 5.7 million residential customers  subscribing to 100 percent renewable electricity, up from 0.8  million in 2006. by now, nearly a sixth of private households  in the country purchase a total of around 20 tWh of  renewable electricity. additional commercial customers bring  green power purchases up to 30 tWh.  australia, canada, japan, south africa, and the united  states also have green power markets. more than half of  americans can subscribe to green power packages from their  utility. in the us, 5.4 million customers purchased 62 tWh  (roughly 1.7 percent of total us power sales) in 2013.  8.4 the global renewable energy market in 2014  the heating and cooling sectors have not grown as quickly as  renewable electricity. nonetheless, the market for solar  thermal collectors grew by nine percent. in contrast, bio-heat  remained nearly unchanged. heat markets often require  district heat networks, for instance, so the infrastructure  obstacles are greater. uncertain policies further impeded the  growth of this market.  electric mobility is moving quickly from a low level. in 2013,  the number of electric vehicles doubled to 665,000.  e- mobility and battery storage, whose cost is also rapidly  dropping, are likely to lead to a breakthrough for renewables  and transportation. biofuels continued to grow, though at a  slower pace; the main obstacle here is sustainability.  nonetheless, biofuels remain the primary source of renewable  fuel in the transport sector, growing by 8.4 percent to 123.7  billion liters in 2014 (ren21-2015).  table 8.1 shows the direct connection between strong  renewable energy policies and market growth. up to now,  countries with stable, effective policies have had the most  success. but as renewable energy becomes cost-competitive  and even cheaper than conventional energy, the focus of  policymaking will move away from financial incentives  towards infrastructure provision, permitting, and levelling the  playing field between incumbents and new players.    e n e r gy r e s o u r c e s a n d s e c u r i t y o f s u p p ly  image coastal lagoons with numerous rounded islands are typical of the indian ocean coastline of western australia. these shapes contrast with the angular, white ponds of the salt extraction  industry. the area has experienced more direct hits by cyclones than any other place on the western australia’s coastline. the repeated hits almost resulted in a decision to permanently evacuate the  small town of onslow (just outside the image). meanwhile, the monte bello islands offshore (just to the north of the image) are guarded as defunct sites of atomic bomb tests.  oil  the reserves chaos  non-conventional oil reserves  gas  shale gas  coal  nuclear  renewable energy  regional renewable  energy potential  greenpeace principles and  criteria for sustainable  bioenergy  the only  scarcity for  solar energy  is the lack of  political will”  “  he issue of supply security is at the top of the energy policy  agenda. concern is focused both on price security and the  security of physical supply for countries with none if their own  resources. in 2013, 78.3% of global final energy demand was  met by fossil fuels, while 19.1% came from renewable energy  sources and 2.6% from nuclear energy (iea 2014).1 the  unrelenting increase in energy demand conflicts with the finite  nature of these resources. at the same time, the global  distribution of oil and gas resources does not match the  distribution of demand. some countries have to rely almost  entirely on fossil fuel imports.  the Global energy assessment (Gea 2012)2 is an integrated  assessment of the global energy system to date, involving 300  authors and 200 reviewers worldwide, including scientists,  policy experts, and industry leaders. table 1 from that  publication shows estimated deposits and the current use of  fossil energy resources. there is obviously no shortage of fossil  fuels; there might be a shortage of conventional oil and gas, but  unconventional resources are still larger than our climate can  cope with. reducing global fossil fuel consumption for reasons  of resource scarcity alone is not mandatory, even though there  may be substantial price fluctuations and regional or structural  shortages as we have seen in the past.  the presently known coal resources and reserves alone  probably amount to around 3,000 times the amount currently  mined in a year. thus, in terms of resource potential, current level  demand could be met for many hundreds of years to come.  coal is also relatively evenly spread across the globe; each  continent holds considerable deposits. however, the supply  horizon is clearly much lower for conventional oil and gas  reserves at 40–50 years. if some resources or deposits currently  a the data reflect the ranges found in the literature; the distinction between reserves and resources is based on current (exploration and production) technology and market conditions. resource data  are not cumulative and do not include reserves.  b reserves, resources, and occurrences of uranium are based on once-through fuel cycle operation. closed fuel cycles and breeding technology would increase the uranium resource dimension  50-60 fold. thorium-based fuel cycles would enlarge the fissile-resource base further.  still classified as ‘unconventional’ are included, the resource  potentials exceed the current consumption rate by far more than  one hundred years. however, serious ecological damage is  frequently associated with fossil energy excavation, particularly  oil sands and shale oil.  over the past few years, new commercial processes have been  developed in the natural gas extraction sector, allowing more  affordable access to gas deposits previously considered  ‘unconventional’, many of which are more frequently found and  evenly distributed globally than traditional gas fields. however,  tight gas and shale gas extraction can potentially lead to seismic  activity and the pollution of groundwater basins and inshore  waters. it therefore needs special regulations. a global  distribution network for liquid gas already exists, in the form of  tankers and loading terminals, so an effective gas market is  expected to develop and that oil and gas prices will cease to be  linked. having more liquid gas in the energy mix (currently  around 10 % of overall gas consumption) significantly increases  supply security, such as by reducing the risks of supply  interruptions associated with international pipeline networks.  Gas hydrates are another type of gas deposit found in the form of  methane aggregates both in the deep sea and underground in  permafrost. they are solid under high pressure and low  temperatures. While there is the possibility of continued greenhouse  gas emissions from such deposits as a consequence of arctic  permafrost soil thaw or a thawing of the relatively flat siberian  continental shelf, there is also potential for extraction of this energy  source. many states, including the usa, japan, india, china and  south korea have launched relevant research programmes.  estimates of global deposits vary greatly; however, all are in the  zettajoule range, for example 70,000–700,000 ej (krey et al., 2009).    the Global energy assessment report estimates the theoretical  potential to be 2,496 – 2,772,889 ej (Gea, 2012), i.e. possibly  more than a thousand times greater than the current annual total  energy consumption. the wide range of this estimation shows the  high uncertainty how much of the existing reserves can really be  exploited. approximately a tenth (1,200–245,600 ej) is rated as  potentially extractable. however, the WbGu advised against  applied research for methane hydrate extraction, as mining bears  considerable risks and methane hydrates do not represent a  sustainable energy source (‘the future oceans’, WbGu, 2006).  9.1 the energy [r]evolution fossil fuel pathway  the energy [r]evolution scenario will phase-out fossil fuels  not simply as they are depleted, but faster as part of a  greenhouse gas reduction pathway required avoiding  dangerous climate change. Decisions about opening up  new oil, gas and coal mines lead almost certainly to a  “lock-in” situation: investments in new oil production will  make it more difficult to change to a renewable energy  pathway in the future.  the energy [r]evolution scenario development aims to  organise an energy transition without any new oil  exploration and production investments in the arctic or  deep sea wells. Unconventional oil such as canada´s tar  sands and australia´s shale oil is not needed to guarantee  the supply oil until it is phased out under the energy  [r]evolution scenario (see chapter 5).  9.1.1 oil  oil is the lifeblood of the modern global economy, as the  supply disruptions of the 1970s made clear. oil is the number  one source of energy, providing about one third of the world’s  needs and the fuel employed almost exclusively for essential  uses such as transportation. however, a passionate debate  has developed over the ability of supply to meet increasing  consumption, a debate obscured by poor information and  stirred by recent soaring prices.  the reserves chaos  public information about oil and gas reserves is strikingly  inconsistent, and potentially unreliable for legal, commercial,  historical and sometimes political reasons. the most widely  available and quoted figures, those from the industry journals  Oil & Gas Journal and World Oil have limited value as they  report the reserve figures provided by companies and  governments without analysis or verification. moreover, as  there is no agreed definition of reserves or standard reporting  practice, these figures usually represent different physical  and conceptual magnitudes. confusing terminology -  ‘proved’, ‘probable’, ‘possible’, ‘recoverable’, ‘reasonable  certainty’ - only adds to the problem. furthermore  estimations oil reserves changes sometimes within only a few  years significantly: While the bp statistical review estimated  the total global proven oil reserves by the end of 2010 at  1344 thousand million barrel (bp 2011)3 only 4 years later the  same source increased the estimation to 1701 thousand  million barrels (bp 2015).4    historically, private oil companies have consistently  underestimated their reserves to comply with conservative  stock exchange rules and for reasons of common business  prudence. Whenever a discovery was made, only a portion of  the geologist’s estimate of recoverable resources was  reported; subsequent revisions would then increase the  reserves from that same oil field over time. national oil  companies, mostly represented by opec (organisation of  petroleum exporting countries), have taken a very different  approach. they are not subject to any sort of accountability,  and their reporting practices are even less clear. in the late  1980s, the opec countries blatantly overstated their  reserves while competing for production quotas, which were  allocated as a proportion of the reserves. although some  revision was needed after the companies were nationalised,  between 1985 and 1990, opec countries increased their  apparent joint reserves by 82%. not only were these dubious  revisions never corrected, but many of these countries have  reported untouched reserves for years, even if no sizeable  discoveries were made and production continued at the same  pace. additionally, the former soviet union’s oil and gas  reserves have been overestimated by about 30% because the  original assessments were later misinterpreted.  Whilst private companies are now becoming more realistic  about the extent of their resources, the opec countries hold  by far the majority of the reported reserves, and their  information is as unsatisfactory as ever. their conclusions  should therefore be treated with considerable caution. fairly  estimating the world’s oil resources would require a regional  assessment of the mean backdated (i.e. ‘technical’)  discoveries.  non-conventional oil reserves  a large share of the world’s remaining oil resources is  classified as ‘non-conventional’. potential fuel sources such  as oil sands, extra heavy oil and oil shale are generally more  costly to exploit, and their recovery causes enormous  environmental damage. the reserves of oil sands and extra  heavy oil worldwide amount to an estimated 6 trillion barrels,  1 to 2 trillion of which are believed to be recoverable if the oil  price is high enough and the environmental standards low  enough.  one of the worst examples of environmental degradation  resulting from the exploitation of unconventional oil reserves  is the oil sands beneath the canadian province of alberta.  they constitute the world’s second-largest proven oil  reserves after saudi arabia. producing crude oil from these  ‘tar sands’ - a heavy mixture of bitumen, water, sand and clay  found beneath more than 54,000 square miles5 of old-growth  forest in northern alberta, an area the size of england and  Wales – releases up to four times more carbon dioxide, the  principal global warming gas, than conventional drilling does.  the booming oil sands industry will produce 100 million  tonnes of co2 a year (equivalent to a fifth of the uk’s entire  annual emissions) by 2012, ensuring that canada would have  missed its emission targets under the kyoto protocol. the oil  rush is also scarring a wilderness landscape: millions of  tonnes of plant life and top soil are scooped away in vast  opencast mines, with millions of litres of water diverted from  rivers. up to five barrels of water are needed to produce a  single barrel of crude, and the process requires huge  amounts of natural gas. it takes two tonnes of the raw sands  to produce a single barrel of oil.  furthermore the exploitation of tar sands is significantly more  expensive than conventional oil production. according to  university of michigan – center for sustainable systems (css  – 2014)6 the production cost of oil sands range between 6.6  and 13.1 $/Gj while conventional oil production costs are  estimated between 1.6 to 6.6 §/Gj. thus, tar sands ar only  economical when the price of conventional oil is high. these  production costs do not include the enormous environmental  and climate damages.  9.1.2 gas  natural gas has been the fastest growing fossil energy source  over the last two decades, boosted by its increasing share in  the electricity generation mix. Gas is generally regarded as an  abundant resource; public concerns about depletion are  limited to oil, even though few in-depth studies address the  subject. Gas resources are more concentrated, and a few  massive fields make up most of the reserves. the largest gas  field in the world holds 15% of the ultimate recoverable  resources (urr), compared to 6% for oil. unfortunately,  information about gas resources suffers from the same bad  practices as oil data because gas mostly comes from the  same geological formations, and the same stakeholders are  involved.  most reserves are initially understated and then gradually  revised upwards, giving an optimistic impression of growth.  by contrast, russia’s reserves, the largest in the world, are  considered to have been overestimated by about 30%. owing  to geological similarities, gas follows the same depletion  dynamic as oil, and thus the same discovery and production  cycles. in fact, existing data for gas is of worse quality than  for oil, with ambiguities arising over the amount produced,  partly because flared and vented gas is not always accounted  for. as opposed to published reserves, the technical ones  have been almost constant since 1980 because discoveries  have roughly matched production.    9.1.3 shale gas  natural gas production, especially in the united states, has  recently involved a growing contribution from nonconventional  gas supplies such as shale gas. conventional  natural gas deposits have a well-defined geographical area.  the reservoirs are porous and permeable, and the gas is  produced easily through a wellbore. it does not generally  require artificial stimulation (inGaa 2008).7  natural gas obtained from unconventional reserves (known as  “shale gas” and “tight gas”) requires the reservoir rock to be  fractured using a process known as hydraulic fracturing or  “fracking”. fracking is associated with a range of  environmental impacts, some of which are not fully  characterized or understood. in addition, it appears that the  greenhouse gas “footprint” of shale gas production may be  significantly greater than of conventional gas, possibly even  worse than of coal. in the us, the country with the highest  production of shale gas globally, experience shows a huge  negative environmental impact (css 2014). a single gas well  requires one to two hectares of land, in addition to road  networks. the drilling fluid, or “mud,” is used to cool the drill  bit, regulate pressure, and remove rock fragments. one well  may require hundreds of tonnes of mud and produce 100 to  550 tonnes of rock cuttings. furthermore, small to moderate  magnitude (<6) seismic activity has been linked to  underground injection of wastewater produced in oil and gas  operations, including a 5.3 and a 5.6 magnitude earthquake  in 2011 (css 2014).  research and investment in non-conventional gas resources  has increased significantly in recent years due to the rising  price of conventional natural gas. in some areas, the  technologies for economic production have already been  developed, in others it is still at the research stage. extracting  shale gas, however, usually goes hand in hand with  environmentally hazardous processes. even so, it is expected  to increase.  greenpeace opposes the exploitation of unconventional  gas reserves. these resources are not needed to guarantee  the needed gas supply under the energy [r]evolution  scenario.  218      9.1.4 coal  coal was the world’s largest source of primary energy until it  was overtaken by oil in the 1960s. today, coal supplies  almost one quarter of the world’s energy. however, it is the  biggest contributor of carbon emissions among all energy  sources, even ahead of oil. despite being the most abundant  of fossil fuels, coal’s development is currently threatened by  environmental concerns; hence, its future will unfold in the  context of both energy security and global warming.  coal is abundant and more equally distributed throughout the  world than oil and gas. Global recoverable reserves are the  largest of all fossil fuels, and most countries have at least  some. moreover, existing and prospective big energy  consumers like the us, china and india have been self-sufficient  in coal, but the situation has changed over the past  years. the usa is now a net exporter, while china is a net  importer of coal.  While hard coal is a widely used fuel, lignite or brown coal is  used only in 18 countries for power generation. this mirrors  the available resources. the total reserves for hard coal are  estimated with 18,246 ej (consumption 2013 132.6 ej/a),  while lignite reserves are estimated at 2,775 ej (consumption  2013 21.6 ej/a) (Gea 2012).  coal has been exploited on a large scale for two centuries, so  both the product and the available resources are well known;  no substantial new deposits are expected to be discovered.  extrapolating the demand forecast forward, the world will  consume 20% of its current reserves by 2030 and 40% by  2050. hence, if current trends are maintained, coal would still  last several hundred years.  9.1.5 nuclear  uranium, the fuel used in nuclear power plants, is a finite  resource whose economically available reserves are limited.  its distribution is almost as concentrated as oil and does not  match global consumption. five countries - canada,  australia, kazakhstan, russia and niger - control three  quarters of the world’s supply, while on canada and russia  operate their own nuclear power plants. as a significant user  of uranium, however, russia’s reserves will be exhausted  within ten years.  conventional uranium resources are defined as those  occurrences from which uranium is recoverable as a primary  product, a co-product, or an important by-product. uranium  reserves are periodically estimated by the oecd’s nuclear  energy agency (nea) and the international atomic energy  agency (iaea) with input from the World nuclear association  (Wna), the World energy council (Wec), and numerous  national geological institutions. nea-iaea estimates have the  widest coverage, so the reserves reported in their latest  survey (the so-called red book) are given here (nea/iaea,  2014). the two organizations define ‘identified reserves’ as  deposits that could be produced competitively in an  expanding market. until 2008, it included uranium  recoverable at less than 130 $/kgu. stimulated by high spot  prices of up to 350 $/kg in 2007 (Gea 2012), the 2010 edition  of the red book extended the cost ranges to 260 $/kgu,  which had not yet further been increased as of 2014 (oecdnea  2014).8  secondary sources, such as old deposits, currently make up  nearly half of worldwide uranium reserves. however, these  will soon be used up. mining capacities will have to be nearly  doubled in the next few years to meet current needs.  a joint report by the oecd nuclear energy agency and the  international atomic energy agency9 estimates that all  existing nuclear power plants will have used up their nuclear  fuel, employing current technology, within less than 70 years.  Given the range of scenarios for the worldwide development  of nuclear power, it is likely that uranium supplies will be  exhausted sometime between 2026 and 2070. this forecast  includes the use of mixed oxide fuel (mox), a mixture of  uranium and plutonium.    the maps on the following pages provide an overview of  the availability of different fuels and their regional  distribution. information in this chapter is based partly on  the report ‘plugging the gap’,10 as well as information from  the international energy agency´s world energy outlook  2014 and bp statistical review 2015.  map 1 oil / map 2: gas / map 3: coal / map 4: nuclear /  map 5: solar / map 6: wind  9.2 renewable energy  nature offers a variety of freely available options for  producing energy. their exploitation is mainly a question of  how to convert sunlight, wind, biomass or water into  electricity, heat or power as efficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively  as possible.  on average, the energy in the sunshine that reaches the earth  is about one kilowatt per square metre worldwide. according  to the ipcc special report renewables (srren),12 solar  energy reaches the earth at a rate 7,900 times greater than  current energy consumption. in one day, the earth gets  enough energy from the sun to satisfy the world’s current  energy requirements for twenty years, even before other  renewable energy sources such as wind and ocean energy  are taken into account. even though only a percentage of that  potential is technically accessible, there is still enough to  provide up to ten times more energy than the world currently  requires.  the Global energy assessment (Gea 2012) report provides a  slightly higher estimation of renewable energy resources  shown in table 9.5; however, both sources prove that the  availability of the resource on a global scale is not a  constraint.  box 9.2 | definition of types of energy resource  potential11  theoretical potential: the physical upper limit of the energy  available from a certain source. for solar energy, for example,  this would be the total solar radiation falling on a particular  surface.  conversion potential: derived from the annual efficiency of  the respective conversion technology, it is therefore not a  strictly defined value, since the efficiency of a particular  technology depends on technological progress.  technical potential: this takes into account additional  restrictions regarding the area realistically available for energy  generation. technological, structural and ecological  restrictions and legislative requirements are accounted for.  economic potential: the proportion of the technical potential  that can be utilised economically. biomass, for example, is  included if it can be exploited economically in competition  with other products and land uses.  sustainable potential: the potential of an energy source is  limited based on an evaluation of ecological and socioeconomic  factors.  220      the overall technical potential of renewable energy is several  times greater than current total energy demand. technical  potential is defined as the amount of renewable energy  output obtainable by full implementation of demonstrated  technologies or practices likely to develop. it takes into  account the primary resources, the socio-geographical  constraints and the technical losses in the conversion  process. the complexity of calculating renewable energy  potentials is particularly great because these technologies  are comparatively young and their exploitation involves  changes to the way in which energy is both generated and  distributed. the technical potential depends on a number of  uncertainties; for instance, a technology breakthrough could  have a dramatic impact, changing the technical potential  assessment within a very short time frame. further, because  of the speed of technology change, many existing studies are  based on out-of-date information. more recent data, such as  significantly increased average wind turbine capacity factors  and output, would increase the technical potentials still  further (sreen, may 2011).  a wide range of estimates is provided in the literature but  studies have consistently found that the total global technical  potential for renewable energy is substantially higher than  both current and projected future global energy demand.  solar has the highest technical potential amongst the  renewable sources, but substantial technical potential exists  for all forms (srren, may 2011).  taking into account the uncertainty of technical potential  estimates, figure 1 provides an overview of the technical  potential of various re resources in the context of current  global electricity and heat demand as well as global primary  energy supply. issues related to technology evolution,  sustainability, resource availability, land use and other factors  that relate to this technical potential are explored in the  relevant chapters. the regional distribution of technical  potential is addressed in chapter 10.  the various types of energy cannot necessarily be added  together to estimate a total, because each type was  estimated independently of the others (for example, the  assessment did not take into account land use allocation; for  instance, pv and concentrating solar power cannot occupy  the same space when a particular site is suitable for either).  Given the large unexploited resources, even without having  reached the full development limits of the various  technologies, it can be concluded that the technical potential  is not a limiting factor in the expansion of renewable energy  generation. it will not be necessary or desirable to exploit the  entire technical potential. implementation of renewable  energy has to respect sustainability criteria in order to  achieve a sound future energy supply. public acceptance is  crucial, especially bearing in mind that the decentralised  character of many renewable energy technologies will move  systems closer to consumers. Without public acceptance,  market expansion will be difficult or even impossible.    note biomass and solar are shown as primary energy due to their multiple uses. note that the figure is presented in logarithmic scale due to the wide range of assessed data.    in addition to the theoretical and technical potential  discussions, this report also considers the economic  potential of renewable energy sources, taking into account all  social costs and assuming perfect information (covered in  section 10.6) and the market potential of re sources. market  potential is defined in box 9.2, but the term often used in  different ways. the general understanding is that market  potential means the total amount of renewable energy that  can be implemented in the market, taking into account  existing and expected real-world market conditions (covered  in section 10.3) shaped by policies, availability of capital and  other factors, each of which is discussed in ar4 and defined  in annex i. the market potential may therefore in theory be  larger than the economic potential. to be realistic, however,  market potential analyses have to take into account the  behaviour of private economic agents under specific  prevailing conditions, which are of course partly shaped by  public authorities. the energy policy framework in a particular  country or region will have a profound impact on the  expansion of renewables.  before looking at the possible regional contribution renewable  energy can make, it is worth understanding the upper limits of  the regional potential of each source to develop an optimal mix  in terms of technical and economic circumstances.  222    9.3 greenpeace principles and criteria for  sustainable bioenergy  clearly, the biggest potential that the terrestrial environment  offers for climate change mitigation lie in a radical change in the  way we use land resources and not in just maximizing the  amount of biomass available to burn. strict criteria for bioenergy,  adequate policies, institutional frameworks and enforcement  capacities are needed to safeguard environmental, climate and  social benefits and ensure that this scarce resource is used in  the most effective manner. this must include the following  principles and criteria (in random order):  principles  • bioenergy production must not cause negative impacts on  the world’s natural capital, such as forests and other natural  ecosystems, biodiversity, soil fertility and water resources.  • bioenergy production must not cause negative impacts on  livelihoods, nor on people’s access to nutritious and healthy  food. land and water grabbing, land use conflicts and  other social conflicts must be prevented.  • bioenergy must not widen social inequalities between  developing and developed countries. international trade in  biomass or biofuels must not undermine food security.  production for local needs should take priority over  production for the global market.  • bioenergy production must be as resource efficient as  possible, and deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gas  emissions compared to fossil fuel-based energy systems.  • biomass must be utilized for energy following the  cascading use principle. under this principle biomass is  preferably used for maintaining soil fertility, food, feed and  materials that store carbon.13 bioenergy should not  compete with these sectors for biomass feedstock. policies  that incentivize the production of bioenergy (and thereby  create a market) must enhance instead of distort the  cascading use of biomass.  • in order to close nutrient cycles and reduce co2 emissions,  bioenergy should preferably be produced from regionally  available biomass and satisfy regional energy need.  • energy demand reductions must be prioritised so as to  reduce the volume of bioenergy required to secure a supply  of 100% renewable energy.  • biomass for bioenergy should preferably be utilized in  applications where it delivers the highest co2 savings.  • bioenergy for electricity should be used for dispatching and  not for large base load capacity.  criteria  greenhouse gas emissions  • any bioenergy project should replace energy produced from  fossil fuels. considering the entire production chain, aboveground  and below-ground carbon stock changes and any  indirect land use changes (iluc), the net greenhouse gas  emission reduction of such a project must be at least 50%  compared to a natural gas reference, 60% compared to an  oil reference and 70% compared to a coal reference. this net  emission reduction must be realized within 20 years.14  • Greenhouse gas emissions as a result of indirect land use  change (iluc) must be integrated in the greenhouse gas  calculation methodology of crops (including trees) for  bioenergy, grown on agricultural land, by determining cropspecific  iluc-factors.  • Whether commercial, non-commercial, diseased or fire-damaged,  standing trees from (semi)natural forests must  not be cut specifically for bioenergy because of the large  upfront carbon debt that is created.  • tree harvest levels in forests must not be increased as a  result of bioenergy production.  • land with a high carbon stock (forests, woodlands,  peatlands, grasslands) must not be converted.15, 16  biodiversity  • bioenergy production must not be extracted from high  conservation value areas (hcvas) and must not cause  direct or indirect destruction, conversion or degradation of  valuable ecosystems, such as forests, woodlands,  peatlands and grasslands.  • bioenergy production must not cause a loss of biodiversity  in agro-ecosystems.  • in forests that are managed for wood production, woody  biomass should only be used for bioenergy production if it  is proven to be sourced from responsibly managed forests  and plantations, equivalent to or exceeding the standard of  the forest stewardship council (fsc).17  • no deliberate release of genetically engineered (Ge)  organisms to the environment must be permitted. any  bioenergy crops, including trees, must not be Ge. Ge  microbes (including those developed by synthetic biology)  must only be used in securely-contained facilities.  references  13 Greenpeace does not necessarily value feed above enerGy. the livestock sector is larGely  unsustainable and should be stronGly decreased in most parts of the World. hoWever, the competition  effect of a policy driven bioenerGy market With the food and feed market lead to uncontrollable  neGative effects, mainly indirect land use chanGe (iluc), Which can undermine the environmental benefits  of bioenerGy.  14 the calculation must include emissions from cultivation, extraction, processinG, storaGe, transport,  and smokestack emissions (burninG biomass is not carbon neutral).

Greenpeace advises governments and  companies to be very cautious with policies related to  bioenergy, to apply all the principles and criteria listed in this  document and to make sure that acquisition of bioenergy  feedstock does not lead to damage to ecosystems, avoids  competition with soil fertility maintenance, food production  and the production of materials that store carbon. the  precautionary principle should guide the development and  implementation of bioenergy policies. the enforcement of a  robust institutional framework must prevent negative social  and environmental impacts. Governments must prioritize  sustainable land use policies, from ecological farming to  effective forest protection.  9.3.2 bioenergy and climate  the international accounting rules for greenhouse gas  emissions, as agreed upon within the united nations  framework convention on climate change (unfccc)  contain a major flaw regarding accounting for the greenhouse  gas emissions of bioenergy. Greenhouse gas emissions due  to land use, land use change and forestry (lulucf)  should be reported in the national greenhouse gas inventories  of annex 1 parties under the kyoto protocol. subsequently,  smokestack greenhouse gas emissions from biomass  combustion are set to zero, to avoid double counting.  however, in practise a lot of biomass that is burned in annex  1 countries comes from non-annex 1 countries and not all  annex 1 countries report lulucf emissions. furthermore,  while reporting land use and land use changes emissions is  mandatory for annex 1 countries, reporting forestry  emissions is only optional. on top of that, due to indirect  land use change (iluc), land use change is taking place in  non-annex 1 countries, as a result of bioenergy policies in  annex 1 countries. despite this, all bioenergy is accounted  for as climate neutral leading to an enormous carbon  accounting error. therefore, carbon accounting schemes  should stop assuming ‘carbon neutrality’ of bioenergy and  account for the net direct and indirect greenhouse gas  performance of bioenergy as outlined in the sustainability  criteria for bioenergy presented in this document.  224    bioenergy and sustainable land use  • agriculture has to be based on sustainable land use  management practices. a shift is needed from industrial  agriculture towards ecological farming based on closed  nutrient and water cycles. agricultural residues can only be  used for bioenergy in limited amounts. policies that  promote bioenergy made from agricultural residues should  not enhance unsustainable industrial agriculture.  • in countries that produce forest biomass, governments  should impose strict biomass sourcing policies that would  stop companies from cutting down standing trees for  energy production.  • livestock production uses 75% of agricultural land,  including both the land used to grow crops for animal feed  and pasture and grazing lands. Whether there will be space  for growing dedicated energy crops on agricultural land in  a responsible way in the future depends, amongst many  other factors, on the development of the diet of populations  around the world. consuming less animal protein reduces  significantly the surface of agricultural land needed for food  production. policies are therefore needed that  disincentivise animal protein consumption.  bioenergy and the energy transition  • access to clean renewable energy must be delivered for all.  apart from being inefficient and time consuming, most  traditional use of biomass in developing countries leads to  respiratory problems for its users and degradation of  forests and woodland resources, as well as soil erosion and  degradation. clean energy access must therefore be  prioritized for communities that still depend on traditional  biomass for cooking and heating. this is a ‘low-hanging  fruit’ that could combine a strong increase in welfare with  environmental protection and nature conservation.  • according to the polluter-pays-principle, subsidies for  bioenergy production must not make fundamentally  unsustainable industries more competitive. examples are  co-firing of biomass with coal in coal-fired power plants or  digestion of animal manure produced by intensive livestock  operations for meat and dairy production. the latter must  be required to mitigate methane emissions, but this should  not be subsidized.  • in biomass importing countries, governments should not  rely on bioenergy for meeting renewable energy targets.  the share of bioenergy must be capped.  • in biomass-importing countries, governments should not  rely on bioenergy for meeting renewable energy targets.  the share of bioenergy must be capped.  • the transition to 100% renewable energy entails a radical  system change, and bioenergy policies should not block  nor delay this change. replacing gasoline and diesel with  biofuels within the infrastructure of the oil industry and  within inefficient internal combustion engines does not  trigger a system change, nor does replacing coal with wood  in coal power plants.  • sustainable bioenergy, which is an inherently a limited  available energy source, should be part of a long term  strategy that leads to 100% renewable energy. sustainable  bioenergy should not be utilized for large-scale base load  electricity production, but for dispatching in the electricity  sector, heat production and as biofuel in aviation, shipping  and heavy road transport. maximising energy savings is  fundamental. Greenpeace’s energy [r]evolution provides a  pathway towards reaching these objectives.  • biofuel blending targets in the transport sector should be  replaced by energy savings and renewable energy targets,  with a focus on a shift to electric transport and truly  sustainable biofuels produced according to the principles  and criteria presented in this paper.    e n e r gy t e c h n o lo g i e s

heating and  cooling technologies  technologies which  convert solar and  wind into energy  are likely to gain  the largest  market shares”  “    this chapter describes the range of technologies available  now and in the future to satisfy the world’s energy demand.  the energy revolution scenario is focused on the potential  for energy savings and renewable sources, primarily in the  electricity and heat generating sectors.  10.1 fossil fuel technologies  the most commonly used fossil fuels for power generation  around the world are coal and gas. oil is still used where  other fuels are not readily available, for example islands or  remote sites, or where there is an indigenous resource.  together, coal and gas currently account for 63% of global  electricity supply (iea 2015).1  10.1.1 coal combustion technologies  in a conventional coal-fired power station, pulverised or  powdered coal is blown into a combustion chamber where it  is burned at high temperature. the resulting heat is used to  convert water flowing through pipes lining the boiler into  steam. this drives a steam turbine and generates electricity.  over 90% of global coal-fired capacity uses this system.  pulverized coal is still the most widely used fuel source and  coal power plants, but supercritical conditions have become  more common in modern coal plants in order to increase  efficiency. steam-drum boilers are still the norm, however,  and they limit total efficiency to roughly 40 percent of the  fuel’s lower heating value (lhv). at the beginning of the  century, state-of-the-art supercritical coal plants, in contrast,  reached thermal efficiencies up to 47 percent of lhv (ieacoal  online).2  coal power stations can vary in capacity from one block of  few hundred megawatts up to ten or more blocks with a total  capacity of several thousand megawatts.a number of  technologies have been introduced to improve the  environmental performance of conventional coal combustion.  these include coal cleaning (to reduce the ash content) and  various ‘bolt-on’ or ‘end-of-pipe’ technologies to reduce  emissions of particulates, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide,  the main pollutants resulting from coal firing apart from  carbon dioxide. flue gas desulphurisation (fGd), for example,  most commonly involves ‘scrubbing’ the flue gases using  alkaline sorbent slurry, which is predominantly lime or  limestone based.  more fundamental changes have been made to the way coal  is burned both to improve its efficiency and further reduce  emissions of pollutants (Wca 2015).3 these include:  • integrated Gasification combined cycle: coal is not burned  directly but reacted with oxygen and steam to form a  synthetic gas composed mainly of hydrogen and carbon  monoxide. this is cleaned and then burned in a gas turbine  to generate electricity and produce steam to drive a steam  turbine. iGcc improves the efficiency of coal combustion  from 38-40% up to 50%.  • supercritical and ultra supercritical: these power plants  operate at higher temperatures than conventional  combustion, again increasing efficiency towards 50%.  • fluidised bed combustion (fbc): coal is burned in a reactor  comprised of a bed through which gas is fed to keep the  fuel in a turbulent state. this improves combustion, heat  transfer and the recovery of waste products. by elevating  pressures within a bed, a high-pressure gas stream can be  used to drive a gas turbine, generating electricity. emissions  of both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide can be reduced  substantially (Wca 2015).  • pressurised pulverised coal combustion: mainly being  developed in Germany, this is based on the combustion of  a finely ground cloud of coal particles creating highpressure,  high-temperature steam for power generation.  the hot flue gases are used to generate electricity in a  similar way to the combined cycle system.  other potential future technologies involve the increased use  of coal gasification. underground coal Gasification, for  example, involves converting deep underground unworked  coal into a combustible gas which can be used for industrial  heating, power generation or the manufacture of hydrogen,  synthetic natural gas or other chemicals. the gas can be  processed to remove co2 before it is passed on to end users.  demonstration projects are underway in australia, europe,  china and japan.  10.1.2 gas combustion technologies  natural gas can be used for electricity generation through the  use of either gas or steam turbines. for the equivalent  amount of heat, gas produces about 45% (iea etp 2014)4  less carbon dioxide during its combustion than coal.  Gas turbine plants use the heat from gases to directly  operate the turbine. natural gas fuelled turbines can start  rapidly and are therefore often used to supply energy during  periods of peak demand, although at higher cost than base  load generation power plants.    particularly high electric efficiencies can be achieved by  combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined  cycle mode. in a combined cycle gas turbine (ccGt) plant, a  gas turbine generator produces electricity and the exhaust  gases from the turbine are then used to make steam to  generate additional electricity. the efficiency of modern ccGt  power stations can be up to 60 (iea etp 2014). most new gas  power plants built since the 1990s have been of this type.  historically, a major driver of technology development for gasfired  generation has been the quest for increased efficiency.  however, the effort to raise power plant efficiency is not the  only technical objective; other criteria, such as part-load  efficiency, ramp rate, turndown ratio and start-up times, are  important aspects for future flexible power generation systems  as well (iea-etp 2014). during the transition period to 100%  renewable flexible and quick starting gas turbines play an  important role to integrate high shares of wind and solar.  in case of low gas prices, ccGt power stations are the  cheapest option for electricity generation in many countries.  capital costs have been substantially lower than for coal and  nuclear plants and construction time shorter.  10.2 carbon reduction technologies and  carbon capture and storage (ccs)  Whenever a fossil fuel is burned, carbon dioxide (co2) is  produced. depending on the type of power plant, a large  quantity of the gas will dissipate into the atmosphere and  contribute to climate change. a hard coal power plant  discharges 730 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour if  it is a (rare) ultra-supercritical coal plant, compared to 810g  co2 /kWh (iea-etp 2014) in an average modern coal plant. a  modern gas power plant in comparison emits around about  350g co2 /kWh. one method, currently under development,  to mitigate the co2 impact of fossil fuel combustion is called  carbon capture and storage (ccs). it involves capturing co2  from power plant smokestacks, compressing the captured  gas for transport via pipeline or ship and pumping it into  underground geological formations for permanent storage.  While frequently touted as the solution to the carbon problem  inherent in fossil fuel combustion, ccs for coal-fired power  stations is unlikely to be ready for at least another decade.  despite the ‘proof of concept’ experiments currently in  progress, the technology remains unproven as a fully  integrated process in relation to all of its operational  components. suitable and effective capture technology has  not been developed and is unlikely to be commercially  available any time soon; effective and safe long-term storage  on the scale necessary has not been demonstrated; and  serious concerns attach to the safety aspects of transport  and injection of co2 into designated formations, while long  term retention cannot reliably be assured.  deploying the technology in coal power plants is likely to  double construction costs, increase fuel consumption by 10-  40%, consume more water, generate more pollutants and  ultimately require the public sector to ensure that the co2  stays where it has been buried. in a similar way to the  disposal of nuclear waste, ccs envisages creating a scheme  whereby future generations monitor in perpetuity the climate  pollution produced by their predecessors.  in october 2014, saskpower’s boundary dam unit 3 in  canada became the world’s first commercial electricity  generating unit with full co2 capture. around 1 million tonnes  of co2 (mtco2) per year – 90% of co2 emissions from the unit  – will be captured and stored underground through enhanced  oil recovery (eor) (iea tcep 2015).5 to put this in a global  context: 1 million tonnes of co2 storage is equal the global  energy related co2 emissions of about 17 minutes (teske  ccs-1).6 in 2014, energy-related co2 emission added up to  32.3 billion tonnes of co2.  10.2.1 carbon dioxide storage  in order to benefit the climate, captured co2 has to be stored  somewhere permanently. current thinking is that it can be  pumped under the earth’s surface at a depth of over 3,000  feet into geological formations, such as saline aquifers.  however, the volume of co2 that would need to be captured  and stored is enormous - a single coal-fired power plant can  produce 7 million tonnes of co2 annually.  it is estimated that a single ‘stabilisation wedge’ of ccs  (enough to reduce carbon emissions by 1 billion metric  tonnes per year by 2050) would require a flow of co2 into the  ground equal to the current flow of coal out of the ground -  and in addition to the associated infrastructure to compress,  transport and pump it underground. it is still not clear that it  will be technically feasible to capture and bury this much  carbon, both in terms of the number of storage sites and  whether they will be located close enough to power plants.  even if it is feasible to bury hundreds of thousands of  megatonnes of co2, there is no way to guarantee that storage  locations will be appropriately designed and managed over  the timescales required. the world has limited experience of  storing co2 underground; the longest running storage project  at sleipner in the norwegian north sea began operation only  in 1996. this is particularly concerning because as long as  co2 is present in geological sites, there is a risk of leakage.  although leakages are unlikely to occur in well-characterised,  managed and monitored sites, permanent storage stability  cannot be guaranteed since tectonic activity and natural  leakage over long timeframes are impossible to predict.    sudden leakage of co2 can be fatal. carbon dioxide is not  itself poisonous but is contained (approx. 0.04 %) in the air  we breathe. but as concentrations increase, it displaces the  vital oxygen in the air; air with concentrations of 7 to 8% co2  by volume causes death by suffocation after 30 to 60 minutes  (Gpi-fh 2008).7  there are also health hazards when large amounts of co2 are  explosively released. although the gas normally disperses  quickly after leaking, it can accumulate in depressions in the  landscape or closed buildings, since carbon dioxide is  heavier than air. it is equally dangerous when it escapes more  slowly and without being noticed in residential areas, for  example in cellars below houses.  the dangers from such leaks are known from natural volcanic  co2 degassing. Gas escaping at the lake nyos crater lake  in cameroon, africa, in 1986 killed over 1,700 people. at  least ten people have died in the lazio region of italy in the  last 20 years as a result of co2 being released.  10.2.2 carbon storage and climate change targets  can carbon storage contribute to climate change reduction  targets? in order to avoid dangerous climate change, global  greenhouse gas emissions need to peak by between 2015  and 2020 and fall dramatically thereafter. however, power  plants capable of capturing and storing co2 are still being  developed and won’t become a reality in a truly commercial  scale for at least another decade, if ever. this means that even  if ccs works, the technology would not make any substantial  contribution towards protecting the climate before 2020.  power plant co2 storage will also not be of any great help in  attaining the goal of at least an 80% greenhouse gas  reduction by 2050 in oecd countries. even if ccs were to be  available in 2020, most of the world’s new power plants will  have just finished being modernised. all that could then be  done would be for existing power plants to be retrofitted and  co2 captured from the waste gas flow. retrofitting power  plants would be an extremely expensive exercise. ‘capture  ready’ power plants are equally unlikely to increase the  likelihood of retrofitting existing fleets with capture technology.  the conclusion reached in the energy revolution scenario is  that renewable energy sources are already available, in many  cases cheaper, and lack the negative environmental impacts  associated with fossil fuel exploitation, transport and  processing. it is renewable energy together with energy  efficiency and energy conservation – and not carbon capture  and storage – that has to increase worldwide so that the  primary cause of climate change – the burning of fossil fuels  like coal, oil and gas – is stopped.  greenpeace opposes any ccs efforts which leads to:  • public financial support to ccs at the expense of funding  renewable energy development and investment in energy  efficiency.  • stagnation of renewable energy, energy efficiency and  energy conservation improvements.  • inclusion of ccs in the kyoto protocol’s clean  development mechanism (cdm) as it would divert funds  away from the stated intention of the mechanism, and  cannot be considered clean development under any  coherent definition of this term.  • promotion of this possible future technology as the only  major solution to climate change, thereby leading to new  fossil fuel developments – especially lignite and black coalfired  power plants, and an increase in emissions in the  short to medium term.  10.3 nuclear technologies  Generating electricity from nuclear power involves  transferring the heat produced by a controlled nuclear fission  reaction into a conventional steam turbine generator. the  nuclear reaction takes place inside a core and surrounded by  a containment vessel of varying design and structure. heat is  removed from the core by a coolant (gas or water) and the  reaction controlled by a moderating element or “moderator”.  across the world over the last two decades there has been a  general slowdown in building new nuclear power stations  because of concern about a possible nuclear accident  (following the events at three mile island, chernobyl, monju  and fukushima) and increased scrutiny of economics and  environmental factors, such as waste management and  radioactive discharges.  nuclear reactor designs: evolution and safety issues  by mid-2015 there were 391 nuclear power reactors  operating in 31 countries around the world.  nuclear plants are commonly divided into four generations.  there are no clear definitions of design categories  (scheider/froggatt 2015):8  generation i: prototype commercial reactors developed in the  1950s and 1960s as modified or enlarged military reactors,  originally either for submarine propulsion or plutonium  production.  generation ii: mainstream reactor designs in commercial  operation worldwide.    generation iii: new generation reactors now being built.  generation iii+ and iv: reactors developed or significantly  modified after the chernobyl disaster.  Generation iii+ reactors include the so-called advanced  reactors, three of which are already in operation in japan,  with more under construction or planned. about 20 different  designs are reported to be under development,9 most of them  ‘evolutionary’ designs developed from Generation ii reactor  types with some modifications, but without introducing  drastic changes. some of them represent more innovative  approaches.  according to the World nuclear association, reactors of  Generation iii are characterised by the following:  • a standardised design for each type to expedite licensing,  reduce capital cost and construction time  • a simpler and more rugged design, making them easier to  operate and less vulnerable to operational upsets  • higher availability and longer operating life, typically 60 years  • reduced possibility of core melt accidents  • minimal effect on the environment  • higher burn-up to reduce fuel use and the amount of waste  • burnable absorbers (‘poisons’) to extend fuel life  to what extent these goals address issues of higher safety  standards, as opposed to improved economics, remains  unclear.  of the new reactor types, the european pressurised Water  reactor (epr) has been developed from the most recent  Generation ii designs to start operation in france and finland  (schneider/froggatt 2015). its stated goals are to improve  safety levels - in particular to reduce the probability of a  severe accident by a factor of ten, achieve mitigation from  severe accidents by restricting their consequences to the  plant itself, and reduce costs. compared to its predecessors,  however, the epr displays several modifications which  constitute a reduction of safety margins, including:  • the volume of the reactor building has been reduced by  simplifying the layout of the emergency core cooling  system, and by using the results of new calculations which  predict less hydrogen development during an accident.  • the thermal output of the plant has been increased by 15%  relative to existing french reactors by increasing core outlet  temperature, letting the main coolant pumps run at higher  capacity and modifying the steam generators.  • the epr has fewer redundant pathways in its safety  systems than a German Generation ii reactor.  several other modifications are hailed as substantial safety  improvements, including a ‘core catcher’ system to control a  meltdown accident. nonetheless, in spite of the changes  being envisaged, there is no guarantee that the safety level of  the epr actually represents a significant improvement. in  particular, reduction of the expected core melt probability by  a factor of ten is not proven. furthermore, there are serious  doubts as to whether the mitigation and control of a core melt  accident with the core catcher concept will actually work.  the World nuclear association (Wna) claims that: “newer  advanced reactors [Generation iii+] now being built have  simpler designs which reduce capital cost. they are more fuel  efficient and are inherently safer. in more detail, it lists some  of the design characteristics of which the most relevant to  this analysis are (schneider/froggatt 2015):  • a standardized design for each type to expedite licensing,  reduce capital cost and reduce construction time,  • a simpler and more rugged design, making them easier to  operate and less vulnerable to operational upsets,  • further reduced possibility of core melt accidents,  • substantial grace period, so that following shutdown the  plant requires no active intervention for (typically) 72 hours,  • resistance to serious damage that would release  radioactivity after an aircraft impact.  price rises occur throughout the period from project  announcement to operation. for example, in 2003, the  french industry ministry estimated that construction costs for  an epr would be just over €1 billion (us$1.2 billion) per  reactor. the price tag had tripled by the time the contract was  signed for the flamanville plant in 2007, and by 2012, the  estimated cost had reached €8.5 billion (us$10.6 billion)  (schneider/froggatt 2015).  finally, Generation iv reactors are currently being developed  with the aim of commercialisation in 20-30 years.  10.4 renewable power technologies and  heating technologies  renewable energy covers a range of natural sources which are  constantly renewed and therefore, unlike fossil fuels and  uranium, will never be exhausted. most of them derive from the  effect of the sun and moon on the earth’s weather patterns.  they also produce none of the harmful emissions and pollution  associated with ‘conventional’ fuels. although hydroelectric  power has been used on an industrial scale since the middle of  the last century, the serious exploitation of other renewable  sources has a more recent history.    box 10.1 | definition of renewable energy  “renewable energy is any form of energy from solar,  geophysical or biological sources that is replenished by  natural processes at a rate that equals or exceeds its rate of  use. re is obtained from the continuing or repetitive flows of  energy occurring in the natural environment and includes  resources such as biomass, solar energy, geothermal heat,  hydropower, tide and waves and ocean thermal energy, and  wind energy. however, it is possible to utilize biomass at a  greater rate than it can grow, or to draw heat from a  geothermal field at a faster rate than heat flows can replenish  it. on the other hand, the rate of utilization of direct solar  energy has no bearing on the rate at which it reaches the  earth. fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) do not fall under this  definition, as they are not replenished within a time frame that  is short relative to their rate of utilization.”  IPCC definition for renewable energy (Source IPCC,  Special Report Renewable Energy /SRREN Renewables for  Power Generation.    10.4.1 solar power (photovoltaics)  there is more than enough solar radiation available all over  the world to satisfy a vastly increased demand for solar  power systems. the sunlight which reaches the earth’s  surface is enough to provide 7,900 times as much energy as  we can currently use. on a global average, each square  metre of land is exposed to enough sunlight to produce 1,700  kWh of power every year. the average irradiation in europe is  about 1,000 kWh per square metre and 1,800 kWh in the  middle east.  photovoltaic (pv) technology involves the generation of  electricity from light. photovoltaic systems contain cells that  convert sunlight into electricity. inside each cell there are  layers of a semi-conducting material. light falling on the cell  creates an electric field across the layers, causing electricity  to flow. the intensity of the light determines the amount of  electrical power each cell generates. a photovoltaic system  does not need bright sunlight in order to operate. it can also  generate some electricity on cloudy and rainy days from  diffuse sunlight.  the most important parts of a pv system are the cells which  form the basic building blocks, the modules which bring  together large numbers of cells into a unit, and, in some  situations, the inverters used to convert the electricity  generated into a form suitable for everyday use. When a pv  installation is described as having a capacity of 3 kWp (peak),  this refers to the output of the system under standard testing  conditions, allowing comparison between different modules.  in central europe a 3 kWp rated solar electricity system, with  a surface area of approximately 27 square metres, would  produce enough power to meet the electricity demand of an  energy conscious household.  there are several different pv technologies and types of  installed system.  pv systems can provide clean power for small or large  applications. they are already installed and generating  energy around the world on individual homes, housing  developments, offices and public buildings.  today, fully functioning solar pv installations operate in both  built environments and remote areas where it is difficult to  connect to the grid or where there is no energy infrastructure.  pv installations that operate in isolated locations are known  as stand-alone systems. in built areas, pv systems can be  mounted on top of roofs (known as building adapted pv  systems – or bapv) or can be integrated into the roof or  building facade (known as building integrated pv systems –  or bipv).  modern pv systems are not restricted to square and flat  panel arrays. they can be curved, flexible and shaped to the  building’s design. innovative architects and engineers are  constantly finding new ways to integrate pv into their  designs, creating buildings that are dynamic, beautiful and  provide free, clean energy throughout their life.    10.4.2 pv cells and modules  crystalline silicon technology: crystalline silicon cells are made  from thin slices cut from a single crystal of silicon (mono  crystalline) or from a block of silicon crystals (polycrystalline or  multi crystalline). this technology is the most common,  representing about 80% of the market today. in addition, it also  exists in the form of ribbon sheets (hoffmann /teske 2012).10  thin film technology: thin film modules are constructed by  depositing extremely thin layers of photosensitive materials  onto a substrate such as glass, stainless steel or flexible  plastic. the latter opens up a range of applications,  especially for building integration (roof tiles) and endconsumer  purposes. four types of thin film modules are  commercially available at the moment: amorphous silicon,  cadmium telluride, copper indium/Gallium  diselenide/disulphide and multi-junction cells.  other emerging cell technologies (at the development or early  commercial stage): these include concentrated photovoltaic,  consisting of cells built into concentrating collectors that use  a lens to focus the concentrated sunlight onto the cells, and  organic solar cells, whereby the active material consists at  least partially of organic dye, small, volatile organic molecules  or polymer.  cells are connected to form larger units called modules. thin  sheets of eva (ethyl vinyl acetate) or pvb (polyvinyl butyral)  are used to bind cells together and provide weather  protection. the modules are normally enclosed between a  transparent cover (usually glass) and a weatherproof backing  sheet (typically made from a thin polymer). modules can be  framed for extra mechanical strength and durability. thin film  modules are usually encapsulated between two sheets of  glass, so a frame is not needed (epia-2011).11  10.4.3 pv systems  the key parts of a solar energy generation system are:  • photovoltaic modules to collect sunlight  • an inverter to transform direct current (dc) to alternate  current (ac)  • a set of batteries for stand-alone pv systems  • support structures to orient the pv modules toward the sun.  the system components, excluding the pv modules, are  referred to as the balance of system (bos) components.  industrial and utility-scale power plants  large industrial pv systems can produce enormous  quantities of electricity at a single location. such power  plants have outputs ranging from hundreds of kilowatts (kW)  to hundreds of megawatts (mW).  the solar panels for industrial systems are usually mounted  on frames on the ground. however, they can also be installed  on large industrial buildings, such as warehouses, airport  terminals and railways stations. the system can make double  use of an urban space and put electricity into the grid where  energy-intensive consumers are located.  residential and commercial systems  grid connected  Grid connected arrays are the most popular type of solar pv  systems for homes and businesses in the developed world.  connected to the local grid, they allow any excess power  produced to be sold to the utility. When solar energy is not  available, electricity can be drawn from the grid. an inverter is  used to convert the dc power produced by the system to ac  power for running normal electrical equipment. this type of  pv system is referred to as being ‘on-grid.’ a ‘Grid support’  system can be connected to the local grid along with a backup  battery. any excess solar electricity produced after the  battery has been charged is then sold to the grid. this system  is ideal for use in areas of unreliable power supply.  stand-alone, off-grid systems  off-grid pv systems have no connection to a grid. an off-grid  system usually has batteries, so power can still be used at  night or after several days of low sun. an inverter is needed  to convert the dc power generated into ac power for use in  appliances. typical off-grid applications include:  • off-grid systems for rural electrification Grid typical off-grid  installations bring electricity to remote areas or villages in  developing countries. they can be small home systems,  which cover a household’s basic electricity needs, or larger  solar mini-grids, which provide enough power for several  homes, a community or small business use.  source ?    • off-grid industrial applications off-grid industrial systems  are used in remote areas to power repeater stations for  mobile telephones (enabling communications), traffic  signals, marine navigational aids, remote lighting, highway  signs and water treatment plants. both full pv and hybrid  systems are used. hybrid systems are powered by the sun  when it is available and by other fuel sources during the  night and extended cloudy periods. off-grid industrial  systems provide a cost-effective way to bring power to  areas very far from existing grids. the high cost of installing  cabling makes off-grid solar power an economical choice.  • consumer goods pv cells are now found in many everyday  electrical appliances such as watches, calculators, toys,  and battery chargers (as for instance embedded in clothes  and bags). services such as water sprinklers, road signs,  lighting and telephone boxes also often rely on individual  pv systems.  • hybrid systems a solar power system can be combined  with another source of power – such as a biomass  generator, a wind turbine or diesel generator - to ensure a  consistent supply of electricity. a hybrid system can be  grid-connected, standalone or grid-supported.  10.4.4 concentrating solar power (csp)  the majority of the world’s electricity today—whether generated  by coal, gas, nuclear, oil or biomass—comes from creating a  hot fluid. concentrating solar power (csp) technologies  produce electricity by concentrating direct-beam solar  irradiance to heat a liquid, solid or gas that is then used in a  downstream process for electricity generation. csp simply  provides an alternative heat source. csp uses direct sunlight,  called ‘beam radiation’ or direct normal irradiation (dni) –  sunlight not dispersed by clouds, fumes or dust in the  atmosphere. this sunlight reaches the earth’s surface in parallel  beams for concentration. suitable sites need to get a lot of this  direct sun - at least 2,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square  metre annually and the best sites receive more than 2,800  kWh/m2/year. in these regions, one square kilometre of land is  enough to generate as much as 100-130 gigawatt hours (GWh)  of solar electricity per year using solar thermal technology.  thus, csp plants, also called solar thermal power plants,  produce electricity in much the same way as conventional  power stations. they obtain their energy input by  concentrating solar radiation and converting it to high  temperature steam or gas to drive a turbine or motor engine.  large mirrors concentrate sunlight into a single line or point.  234    the heat created there is used to generate steam. this hot, highly  pressurised steam is used to power turbines which generate  electricity. in sun-drenched regions, csp plants can guarantee a  large proportion of electricity production. this technology builds  on much of the current know-how on power generation in the  world today. it will benefit from on-going advances in solar  concentrator technology and as improvements continue to be  made in steam and gas turbine cycles.  some of the advantages of csp:  • it can integrate thermal storage for peaking loads (less than  one hour) and intermediate loads (three to six hours);  • it can provide industrial process heat  • it can be used of desalination to produce drinking water  • it has modular and scalable components;  types of csp systems  all systems require four main elements: a concentrator, a  receiver, some form of transfer medium or storage, and  power conversion. many different types of system are  possible, including combinations with other renewable and  non-renewable technologies, but there are four main groups  of solar thermal technologies. this whole subchapter is  based on a technical paper of the european solar thermal  electricity association (estela 2015):12  parabolic trough  parabolic trough plants use rows of parabolic trough  collectors, each of which reflect the solar radiation into an  absorber tube. the troughs track the sun around one axis,  with the axis typically being oriented north-south. synthetic oil  circulates through the tubes, heating up to approximately  400°c. the hot oil from numerous rows of troughs is passed  through a heat exchanger to generate steam for a  conventional steam turbine generator to generate electricity.  some of the plants under construction have been designed to  produce power not only during sunny hours but also to store  energy, allowing the plant to produce an additional 7.5 hours  of nominal power after sunset, which dramatically improves  their integration into the grid. molten salts are normally used  as storage fluid in a hot-and-cold two-tank concept. plants in  operation in europe: andasol 1 and 2 (50 mW +7.5 hour  storage each); puertollano (50 mW); alvarado (50 mW) and  extresol 1 (50 mW + 7.5 hour storage). land requirements are  of the order of 2 km2 for a 100-mWe plant, depending on the  collector technology and assuming no storage is provided.  linear fresnel systems  collectors resemble parabolic troughs, with a similar power  generation technology, using long lines of flat or nearly flat  fresnel reflectors to form a field of horizontally mounted flat  mirror strips, collectively or individually tracking the sun.  these are cheaper to install than trough systems but not as  efficient. there is one plant currently in operation in europe:  puerto errado (2 mW).  central receiver or solar tower  central receivers (or “power towers”) are point-focus  collectors that are able to generate much higher  temperatures than troughs and linear fresnel reflectors. this  technology uses a circular array of mirrors (heliostats) where  each mirror tracks the sun, reflecting the light onto a fixed  receiver on top of a tower. temperatures of more than  1,000°c can be reached. a heat-transfer medium absorbs  the highly concentrated radiation reflected by the heliostats  and converts it into thermal energy to be used for the  subsequent generation of superheated steam for turbine  operation. to date, the heat transfer media demonstrated  include water/steam, molten salts, liquid sodium and air. if  pressurised gas or air is used at very high temperatures of  about 1,000°c or more as the heat transfer medium, it can  even be used to directly replace natural gas in a gas turbine,  thus making use of the excellent efficiency (60%+) of modern  gas and steam combined cycles.  after an intermediate scaling up to 30 mW capacity, solar  tower developers now feel confident that grid-connected  tower power plants can be built up to a capacity of 200 mWe  solar-only units. use of heat storage will increase their  flexibility. although solar tower plants are considered to be  further from commercialisation than parabolic trough  systems, they have good longer-term prospects for high  conversion efficiencies. projects are being developed in  spain, south africa and australia.  parabolic dish  a dish-shaped reflector is used to concentrate sunlight on to  a receiver located at its focal point. the receiver moves with  the dish. the concentrated beam radiation is absorbed into  the receiver to heat a fluid or gas to approximately 750°c.  this is then used to generate electricity in a small piston,  stirling engine or micro turbine attached to the receiver.  dishes have been used to power stirling engines up to  900°c, and also for steam generation. the largest solar  dishes have a 485-m2 aperture and are in research facilities or  demonstration plants. currently the capacity of each stirling  engine is small — in the order of 10 to 25 kWelectric. there  is now significant operational experience with dish/stirling  engine systems and the technology has been under  development for many years, with advances in dish  structures, high-temperature receivers, use of hydrogen as  the circulating working fluid, as well as some experiments  with liquid metals and improvements in stirling engines — all  bringing the technology closer to commercial deployment.  although the individual unit size may only be of the order of  tens of kWe, power stations having a large capacity of up to  800 mWe have been proposed by aggregating many  modules. because each dish represents a stand-alone  electricity generator, from the perspective of distributed  generation there is great flexibility in the capacity and rate at  which units are installed. however, the dish technology is less  likely to integrate thermal storage. the potential of parabolic  dishes lies primarily for decentralised power supply and  remote, stand-alone power systems. projects are currently  planned in the united states, australia and europe.  csp system components  in addition to the different types of solar reflector systems, a  csp power plant has power generation equipment like what  is used in gas power plants; increasingly, a thermal storage  unit is also installed. the output of a csp power plant is  power and different levels of heat which can be used for  industrial process heat, for the desalination of water, etc.  10.4.5 csp - thermal storage  thermal energy storage integrated into a system is an important  attribute of csp. until recently, this has been primarily for  operational purposes, providing 30 minutes to 1 hour of fullload  storage. this eases the impact of thermal transients such  as clouds on the plant, assists start-up and shut-down, and  provides benefits to the grid. trough plants are now designed  for 6 to 7.5 hours of storage, which is enough to allow  operation well into the evening when peak demand can occur  and tariffs are high.  to provide solar electricity after sunset with csp, thermal  energy is stored in very large quantities. thermal energy storage  (tes) systems are an integral part of a csp power plant,  allowing eliminating short term variations of electricity  production: the thermal energy collected by the solar field is  stored for conversion to electricity later in the day. storage can  adapt the profile of power produced throughout the day to  demand and can increase the total power output of a plant with  given maximum turbine capacity by storing excess energy of a  larger solar field before it is used in the turbine. eventually the  plant can be operated nearly at 100% capacity factor as a base  load plant in appropriate locations.  236      thermal storage has been used in 40% of spanish plants since  2010 and is almost included in every new plant today. a number  of 5 to 10 hours storage, depending on the dni is an average.  the iea reports that “when thermal storage is used to increase  the capacity factor, it can reduce the levelised cost of solar  thermal electricity (lcoe). thermal storage also has remarkable  “return” efficiency, especially when the storage medium is also  used as heat transfer fluid. it may then achieve 98% return  efficiency – i.e., energy losses are limited to about 2%.  there are 3 categories of storage media that can be used in  csp plant but their maturity degree is different (estela 2015):  • advanced sensible heat storage systems: such system are in  most of the state-of-the-art csp plants, with a “two-tank  molten salt storage” (two tanks with molten salts at  different temperature levels). the development of new  storage mediums with improved thermal stability, such as  molten salt mixtures will allow higher temperatures to be  attained. higher temperatures allow for increased energy  density within the tes and hence lower the specific  investment costs for the system. improvements to tes  systems would have the potential to reduce capex while  improving efficiency.  • cost-effective latent heat storage systems: latent heat  storage has not been implemented in commercial ste  plants yet, but several research project support the  introduction and use of phase changing materials in tes  technologies. the use of latent heat storage offers new  possibilities for dsG helping in achieving cost  competitiveness with sensible heat technologies.  • thermochemical storage systems: to date, there are no  known commercial systems for thermochemical tes in ste  plants. research into the application this technology  started 40 years ago. development projects assume  potentials in energy density up to 10 times higher than a  comparable sensible heat tes (estela 2015).    1. parabolic mirrors (concentratinG solar collector field).  heat transfer fluid is heated directly by the sun’s rays.  2. heat exchangers.  3. thermal storage tanks.  4. condenser. converts the steam back into Water and the  process beGins aGain.  5. steam turbine & generator. inside the steam expands and  spins the turbine, GeneratinG electricity that passes  throuGh a transformer before beinG feed into the Grid.  10.4.6 wind power  Wind energy has grown faster than all other electricity sources  in the last 20 years, and turbine technology has advanced  sufficiency that a single machine can have a capacity of 7  megawatt. in europe, wind farms are generally well integrated  into the environment and accepted by the public. smaller  models can produce electricity for areas that are not  connected to a central grid, through use of battery storage.  Wind speeds and patterns are good enough for this  technology on all continents, on both coastlines and inland.  the wind resource out at sea is particularly productive and is  now being harnessed by offshore wind parks with  foundations embedded in the ocean floor.  wind turbine design  modern wind technology is available for low and high wind  speeds, and in a variety of climates. a variety of onshore wind  turbine configurations have been investigated, including both  horizontal and vertical axis designs (see figure 4 ). the  horizontal axis design dominates, and most designs now  centre on the three-blade, upwind rotor; locating the turbine  blades upwind of the tower prevents the tower from blocking  wind flow onto the blades and producing extra aerodynamic  noise and loading (eWea 2008).13  the blades are attached to a hub and main shaft, which  transfers power to a generator, sometimes via a gearbox  (depending on design). the electricity output is channelled down  the tower to a transformer and eventually into the local grid. the  main shaft and main bearings, gearbox, generator and control  system are contained within a housing called the nacelle.  as turbine size has increased over time, turbine output is  controlled by pitching (i.e., rotating) the blades along their long  axis.14 reduced cost of power electronics allowed for variable  speed wind turbine operation, which helps maintain production  in variable and gusty winds, keeps large wind power plants  generating during electrical faults, and provides reactive power.  modern wind turbines typically operate at variable speeds  using full-span blade pitch control. over the past 30 years,  the average wind turbine size has grown significantly (figure  9), with most onshore wind turbines installed globally in 2014  having a rated capacity of 3.5 to 7,5 mW; the average size of  turbines installed in 2014 was at around 2.5 – 3.0 mW.  as of 2015, wind turbines used on land typically have 80 to 120-  m tall towers, with rotors between 80 to 125 m in diameter. the  average tower installed in 2014 in Germany for example was 93  m tall (statistica 2015).15 some commercial machines have  diameters and tower heights above 125 m, and even larger  models are being developed. modern turbines operate spin at  12 to 20 revolutions per minute (rpm), much slower than the  models from the 1980s models, which spun at 60 rpm. modern  rotors are slower, less visually disruptive and less noisy.  onshore wind turbines are typically grouped together into wind  power plants, with between 5- 300 mW generating capacity,  and are sometimes also called wind farms. turbines have been  getting larger to help reduce the cost of generation (reach  better quality wind), reduce investment per unit of capacity and  reduce operation and maintenance costs (eWea 2014).16  238    for turbines in land, there will be engineering and logistical  constraints to size because the components have to travel by road.  modern wind turbines have nearly reached their theoretical  maximum (0.59) of aerodynamic efficiency, measured by the  coefficient of performance (0.44 in the 1980s to about 0.50  by the mid-2000s).  offshore wind energy technology  by the end of 2014, the existing offshore market made up just  2.4% of the world’s land-based installed wind capacity;  however, the potential at sea is driving the latest  developments towards large turbine sizes. Wind technology  currently develops for two different markets: offshore and  sites of high wind resources; and onshore sites of moderate  resources which requires different technical concepts.  the first offshore wind power plant was built in 1991 in  denmark, consisting of eleven 450 kW wind turbines. in 2014  1,713 mW of new offshore capacity was added, bringing the  total to 8,759 megawatts (GWec 2015).17  by going offshore, wind energy can make use stronger winds  and provide clean energy to countries where there is less  technical potential for land-based wind energy development and  where it would conflict with other land uses. there is less ‘shear’  near hub height with offshore wind. Greater economies of scale  result from large turbines that can be transported by ship and  from larger power plants. offshore wind farms also reduce the  need for new, long-distance, land-based transmission  infrastructure that wind farms on land can require.18  there is considerable interest in offshore wind energy  technology in the eu and, increasingly, in other regions such  as china, japan and north america, despite the typically  higher costs relative to onshore wind energy, because of its  advantage to supply large coastal cities and/or industry.  offshore wind turbines built between 2009 and 2014 typically  have nameplate capacity ratings of 2 to 5 mW, and larger  turbines are under development. offshore wind farms are  installed in groups of 50 to 100 turbines with total capacities  in the low to medium hundred megawatt capacity, and often  installed in water between 10 and 20 m deep. distance to  shore has is mostly less than 20 km, but average distance has  increased over time.19 offshore wind is likely to be installed at  greater depths, and the larger turbines (5 to 10mW or larger)  as experience is gained and for greater economies of scale.  offshore wind turbine technology has been very similar to  onshore designs, with some structural modifications and with  special foundations.20 other design features include marine  navigational equipment and monitoring and infrastructure to  minimise expensive servicing. by 2015, the offshore wind  industry started moving into the commercialization phase;  further cost reductions are likely. the German offshore Wind  industry expects that, in stable market conditions, the costs  of offshore wind power can decrease by up to 39 % by 2023  (GoWef 2014).  the next step – floating offshore wind  in order to unlock the full potential of offshore wind, areas  with water depth greater than 50 meters must be opened for  this technique. large cities in asia and latin america are  often close to the sea, and offshore wind farms can  potentially supply mega-cities with electricity and/or the  production of syn-fuels in the future.  the concept of a floating wind turbine has existed since the  early 1970s, but the industry only started researching it in the  mid-1990s. in 2008, blue h technologies installed the first  test floating wind turbine off the italian coast. the turbine had  a rated capacity of 80 kW; after a year of testing and data  collection, it was decommissioned. a year later, the poseidon  37 project followed, a 37m-wide wave energy plant and  floating wind turbine foundation tested at donG’s offshore  wind farm at onsevig. in 2009, statoil installed the world’s  first large scale grid connected floating wind turbine, hywind,  in norway, with a 2.3 mW siemens turbine. the second large  scale floating system, Windfloat, developed by principle  power in partnership with edp and repsol, was installed off  the portuguese coast in 2011. equipped with a 2 mW vestas  wind turbine, the installation started producing energy in  2012 (eWea 7-2013).22  2011 was the best year on record for deep offshore  development with two floating substructures tested, seatwirl  and sWay, in addition to the grid connected Windfloat  project. by the end of 2013, offshore wind farms used three  main types of deep offshore foundations, adapted from the  offshore oil and gas industry (eWea 7-2013):  • spar buoy: a very large cylindrical buoy stabilizes the wind  turbine using ballast. the centre of gravity is much lower in  the water than the centre of buoyancy. Whereas the lower  parts of the structure are heavy, the upper parts are usually  empty elements near the surface, raising the centre of  buoyancy. the hywind concept consists of this slender,  ballast-stabilised cylinder structure.  • tension leg platform: a very buoyant structure is semi  submerged. tensioned mooring lines are attached to it and  anchored on the seabed to add buoyancy and stability.  • semi-submersible: combining the main principles of the two  previous designs, a semi submerged structure is added to  reach the necessary stability. Windfloat uses this technology.    10.4.7 biomass energy  biomass is a broad term used to describe material of recent  biological origin that can be used as a source of energy. it  includes wood, crops, algae and other plants as well as  agricultural and forest residues. biomass can be used for a  variety of end uses: heating, electricity generation or as fuel  for transportation. the term ‘bioenergy’ is used for biomass  energy systems that produce heat and/or electricity;  ‘biofuels’, for liquid fuels used in transport. biodiesel and  bioethanol manufactured from various crops have become  increasingly common as vehicle fuels, especially as the cost of  oil has risen.  biological power sources are renewable, easily stored, and, if  sustainably harvested, co2 neutral. the gas emitted during  their transfer into useful energy is balanced by the carbon  dioxide absorbed when they were growing plants.  bioenergy for power generation  electricity generating biomass power plants work just like  natural gas or coal power stations, except that the fuel must  be processed before it can be burned. these power plants  are generally not as large as coal power stations because  their fuel supply needs to grow as near as possible to the  plant. heat generation from biomass power plants can result  either from utilising a combined heat and power (chp)  system, piping the heat to nearby homes or industry, or  through dedicated heating systems. small heating systems  using specially produced pellets made from waste wood, for  example, can be used to heat single family homes instead of  natural gas or oil.  10.4.8 biomass technology  a number of processes can be used to convert energy from  biomass: thermochemical processes (direct combustion of  solids, liquids or a gas via pyrolysis or gasification) and  biological systems, (decomposition of solid biomass to liquid  or gaseous fuels by processes such as anaerobic digestion  and fermentation).  thermochemical processes  direct combustion  direct biomass combustion is the most common way of  converting biomass into energy for both heat and electricity,  accounting for over 90% of biomass generation. combustion  processes are well understood; in essence, when carbon and  hydrogen in the fuel react with excess oxygen to form co2 and  water and release heat. in rural areas, many forms of biomass  are burned for cooking. Wood and charcoal are also used as  a fuel in industry. a wide range of existing commercial  technologies are tailored to the characteristics of the biomass  and the scale of their applications (iea bio-2009).  the technologies types are fixed bed, fluidised bed or  entrained flow combustion. in fixed bed combustion, such as  a grate furnace, air first passes through a fixed bed for  drying, gasification and charcoal combustion. the  combustible gases produced are burned after the addition of  secondary air, usually in a zone separated from the fuel bed.  in fluidised bed combustion, the primary combustion air is  injected from the bottom of the furnace with such high  velocity that the material inside the furnace becomes a  seething mass of particles and bubbles. entrained flow  combustion is suitable for fuels available as small particles,  such as sawdust or fine shavings, which are pneumatically  injected into the furnace.  gasification  biomass fuels are increasingly being used with advanced  conversion technologies, such as gasification systems, which  are more efficient than conventional power generation.  biomass gasification occurs when a partial oxidation of  biomass happens upon heating, producing a combustible gas  mixture (called producer gas or fuel gas) rich in co and  hydrogen (h2) that has an energy content of 5 to 20 mj/nm3  (depending on the type of biomass and whether gasification  is conducted with air, oxygen or through indirect heating).  this energy content is roughly 10 to 45% of the heating value  of natural gas (ipcc srren 2011).2  figure 10.11 | biogas technology  fuel gas can then be upgraded to a higher-quality gas  mixture called biomass synthesis gas or syngas (faaij 2006).24  a gas turbine, boiler or steam turbine can be used to employ  unconverted gas for electricity co-production. coupled with  electricity generators, syngas can be used as a fuel in place  of diesel in suitably designed or adapted internal combustion  engines. most commonly available gasifiers use wood or  woody biomass, specially designed gasifiers can convert  non-woody biomass materials (yokoyama and matsumura  2008).25 compared to combustion, gasification is more  efficient, providing better controlled heating, higher  efficiencies in power production and the possibility for coproducing  chemicals and fuels (kirkels and verbong 2011).26  Gasification can also decrease emission levels compared to  power production with direct combustion and a steam cycle.  pyrolysis  pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of biomass occurring  in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic environment) that  produces a solid (charcoal), a liquid (pyrolysis oil or bio-oil)  and a gas product. the relative amounts of the three coproducts  depend on the operating temperature and the  residence time used in the process. lower temperatures  produce more solid and liquid products and higher  temperatures more biogas. heating the biomass feedstock to  moderate temperatures (450°c to 550°c) produce  oxygenated oils as the major products (70 to 80%), with the  remainder split between a bio char and gases (iea bio-2009).  biological systems  these processes are suitable for very wet biomass materials  such as food or agricultural wastes, including farm animal slurry.  anaerobic digestion  anaerobic digestion means the breakdown of organic waste  by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment. this produces a  biogas typically made up of 65% methane and 35% carbon  dioxide. purified biogas can then be used both for heating  and electricity generation.  fermentation  fermentation is the process by which growing plants with a  high sugar and starch content are broken down with the help of  micro-organisms to produce ethanol and methanol. the end  product is a combustible fuel that can be used in vehicles.  biomass power station capacities typically range up to 15  mW, but larger plants are possible. however bio mass power  station should use the heat as well, in order to use the energy  of the biomass as much as possible, and therefore the size  should not be much larger than 25 mW (electric). this size  could be supplied by local bioenergy and avoid unsustainable  long-distance fuel supply.    biofuels  converting crops into ethanol and bio diesel made from  rapeseed methyl ester (rme) currently takes place mainly in  brazil, the usa and europe. also processes to produce  synthetic fuels from ‘biogenic synthesis’ gases will play a  larger role in the future, especially for aviation and marine  transport systems. theoretically, biofuels can be produced  from any biological carbon source, although the most  common are photosynthetic plants. various plants and plantderived  materials are used for biofuel production.  Globally, biofuels are most commonly used to power vehicles  but can also be used for other purposes. the production and  use of biofuels must result in a net reduction in carbon  emissions compared to the use of traditional fossil fuels to  have a positive effect in climate change mitigation.  sustainable biofuels can reduce the dependency on  petroleum and thereby enhance energy security.  • bioethanol is a fuel manufactured through the fermentation of  sugars. sugars are used directly (sugar cane or beet) or by  breaking down starch in grains such as wheat, rye, barley or  maize. in the european union, bioethanol is mainly produced  from grains, with wheat as the dominant feedstock. in brazil,  the preferred feedstock is sugar cane, whereas in the usa it  is corn (maize). bioethanol produced from cereals has a byproduct,  a protein-rich animal feed called dried distillers  Grains with soluble (ddGs). for every tonne of cereals used  for ethanol production, on average one third will enter the  animal feed stream as ddGs. because of its high protein  level, ddGs is currently used as a replacement for soy cake.  bioethanol can either be blended into gasoline (petrol) directly  or be used in the form of etbe (ethyl tertiary butyl ether).  • biodiesel is a fuel produced from vegetable oil sourced  from rapeseed, sunflower seeds or soybeans along with  used cooking oils or animal fats. if used vegetable oils are  recycled as feedstock for biodiesel production, pollution  from discarded oil is reduced, providing a new way of  transforming a waste product into transport energy. blends  of biodiesel and conventional diesel are the most common  products distributed in the retail transport fuel market.  • most countries use a labelling system to explain the  proportion of biodiesel in any fuel mix. fuel containing 20%  biodiesel is labelled b20, while pure biodiesel is referred to  as b100. blends of 20 % biodiesel with 80 % petroleum  diesel (b20) can generally be used in unmodified diesel  engines. used in its pure form, b100 may require certain  engine modifications. biodiesel can also be used as a  heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers. older  furnaces may contain rubber parts that would suffer from  biodiesel’s solvent properties but can otherwise burn it  without any conversion.  there are many different biomass feedstock types and  numerous conversion technologies to produce fuels for  heat and/or power and transport technologies; figure  10.12 provides a simplified overview.  1 parts of each feedstock, e.g. crop residues, could also be used in other routes.  2 each route also gives co-products.  3 biomass upgrading includes any one of the densification processses) pelletisation, pyrolysis, torrefaction, etc.)  4 ad = anaerobic digestion    10.4.9 bioenergy and greenhouse gas (ghg) emission  reduction  it is of great importance that bioenergy lower greenhouse gas  emissions; only then does the use of bioenergy make ecologic  sense. the ranges of GhG emissions per unit of energy output  (mj) from major modern bioenergy chains compared to  conventional and selected advanced fossil fuel energy  systems (land use-related net changes in carbon stocks and  land management impacts are excluded) are shown in figure  10.13. commercial and developing (such as algae biofuels,  fischer-tropsch, etc.) systems for biomass and fossil  technologies are illustrated.  greenpeace has a very strict policy in order to use only  sustainable bioenergy in future energy systems.  guidelines for the future use of bioenergy are documented  in chapter 8.    10.4.10 geothermal energy  Geothermal energy is heat derived from underneath the  earth’s crust. in most areas, this heat comes from a long way  down and has mostly dissipated by the time it reaches the  surface, but in some places the geothermal resources are  relatively close to the surface and can be used as nonpolluting  sources of energy. these “hotspots” include the  western part of the usa, west and central eastern europe,  iceland, asia and new Zealand (the pacific rim).  the uses of geothermal energy depend on temperatures. low  and moderate areas temperature areas (less than 90°c or  between 90°c and 150°c, respectively) can be used for their  heat directly, while the highest temperature resources (above  150°c) are suitable only for electric power generation.  today’s total global geothermal generation is approximately  10,700 mW, with nearly one-third in usa (over 3,000 mW),  and the next biggest share in philippines (1,900 mW) and  indonesia (1,200 mW) (ipcc-srren 2012).28  technology and applications  Geothermal energy is currently extracted using wells or other  means that produce hot fluids from either hydrothermal  reservoirs with naturally high permeability or reservoirs  engineered and fractured to extract heat. see below for more  information on these “enhanced geothermal systems”.  production wells discharge hot water and/or steam.  in high-temperature hydrothermal reservoirs, water occurs  naturally underground under pressure in liquid from. as it is  extracted, the pressure drops, and the water is converted to  steam to a turbine that generates electricity. any remaining  hot water may go through the process again to obtain more  steam. the remaining salty water is sent back to the reservoir  through injection wells, sometimes via another system to use  the remaining heat. a few reservoirs, such as the Geysers in  the usa, larderello in italy, matsukawa in japan, and some  indonesian fields, naturally produce steam vapour that can be  used in a turbine. hot water produced from intermediate temperature  hydrothermal or enhanced Geothermal system  (eGs) reservoirs can also be used in heat exchangers to  generate power in a binary cycle, or in direct use  applications. recovered fluids are also injected back into the  reservoir.29 the key technologies are:  exploration and drilling includes estimating where the resource  is, its size and depth with geophysical methods and then  drilling exploration wells to test the resource. today,  geothermal wells are drilled over a range of depths down to 5  km using methods similar to those used for oil and gas.  advances in exploration and drilling can technology can be  expected. for example, if several wells are drilled from the  same pad, it can access more heat resources and minimize  the surface impact.30  reservoir engineering is focused on determining the volume of  geothermal resource and the optimal plant size. the optimum  has to consider sustainable use of the resources and safe,  efficient operation. the modern method of estimating  reserves and sizing power plants is ‘reservoir simulation’ – a  process that starts with a conceptual model followed by a  calibrated, numerical representation.31 then, future behaviour  is forecast under selected load conditions using an algorithm  (such as touGh2) to select the plant size. injection  management looks after the production zones, and uses data  to make sure the hot reservoir rock is re-charged sufficiently.  geothermal power plants use the steam created from heating  water via natural underground sources to power a turbine  that produces electricity. the technique has been used for  decades in the us, new Zealand and iceland and is under  trial in Germany, where it is necessary to drill many kilometres  down to reach high-temperature zones. the basic types of  geothermal power plants in use today are steam-condensing  turbines, binary-cycle units and cogeneration plants.  • steam condensing turbines can be used in flash or drysteam  plants operating at sites with intermediate and high-temperature  resources (≥150°c). the power units usually  have 20 to 110 mWe (dipippo, 2008) and may utilize a  multiple-flash system, obtaining steam at successively  lower pressures to get as much energy as possible from the  geothermal fluid. the only difference between a flash plant  and a dry-steam plant is that the latter does not require  brine separation, resulting in a simpler and cheaper design.  • binary-cycle plants, typically organic rankine cycle (orc)  units, typically extract heat from low and intermediate-temperature  geothermal fluids from hydrothermal and eGs  reservoirs. binary plants are more complex than  condensing ones since the geothermal fluid (water, steam  or both) passes through a heat exchanger to heat another  working fluid (such as isopentane or isobutene), which  vaporises, drives a turbine, and then is air-cooled or  condensed with water. binary plants are often constructed  as smaller, linked modular units (a few mWe each).  • combined or hybrid plants comprise two or more of the  above basic types to improve versatility, increase overall  thermal efficiency, improve load-following capability, and  efficiently cover a wide resource-temperature range.  • cogeneration plants or combined / cascaded heat and  power plants (chp) produce both electricity and hot water  for direct use. they can be used in relatively small  industries and communities of a few thousand people.  iceland, for example, runs geothermal cogeneration plants  with a combined capacity of 580 mWth.32 at the oregon  institute of technology, a chp plant cover most of the  electricity and all the heat demand.33  10.4.11 enhanced geothermal systems (egs)  in some areas, the subsurface regions are ‘stimulated’ to  make use of geothermal energy for power generation. a  reservoir is made by creating or enhancing a network of  fractures in the rock underground so fluid can move between  the injection point and where power is produced (production  wells) (see figure 10.14). heat is extracted by circulating  water through the reservoir in a closed loop; it can be used  for power generation or heating via the technologies  described above. recently developed models provide  insights into geothermal exploration and production. eGs  projects are currently at a demonstration and experimental  stage in a number of countries. the key challenges are  creating enough reservoirs with sufficient volumes for  commercial rates of energy production, while protecting  water resources and avoiding instability of the earth or  seismicity (earthquakes).34    10.4.12 hydropower  Water has been used to produce electricity for about a  century. even today, it covers around one fifth of the world’s  power demand. the main requirement for hydropower is to  create an artificial head of water that has sufficient energy to  power a turbine when diverted into a channel or pipe.  classification by head and size  the ‘head’ in hydropower refers to the difference between the  upstream and the downstream water levels, which  determines the water pressure on the turbines. along with  discharge, the pressure level determines what type of  hydraulic turbine is used. the classification of ‘high head’ and  ‘low head’ varies from country to country, and there is no  generally accepted scale.  broadly, pelton impulse turbines are used for high heads  (where a jet of water hits a turbine and reverses direction).  francis reaction turbines are used to exploit medium heads  (which run full of water and in effect generate hydrodynamic  ‘lift’ to propel the turbine blades). for low heads, kaplan and  bulb turbines are applied.  classification according to refers to installed capacity measured  in mW. small-scale hydropower plants are more likely to be runof-  river facilities than are larger hydropower plants, but reservoir  (storage) hydropower stations of all sizes use the same basic  components and technologies. it typically takes less time and  effort to construct and integrate small hydropower schemes  into local environments35 so their deployment is increasing in  many parts of the world. small schemes are often considered in  remote areas where other energy sources are not viable or are  not economically attractive.  greenpeace supports the sustainability criteria  developed by the international rivers network  ().  classification by facility type  hydropower plants are also classified in the following  categories according to operation and type of flow:  • run-of-river (ror)  • storage (reservoir)  • pumped storage, and  • in-stream technology, a young and less-developed  technology.  run-of-river  these plants draw the energy for electricity mainly from the  available flow of the river and do not collect significant  amounts of stored water. they may include some short-term  storage (hourly, daily), but the generation profile will generally  be dictated by local river flow conditions. because generation  depends on rainfall, it may have substantial daily, monthly or  seasonal variations, especially when located in small rivers or  streams with widely varying flows. in a typical plant, a portion  of the river water might be diverted to a channel or pipeline  (penstock) to convey the water to a hydraulic turbine  connected to an electricity generator (see figure 10.16). ror  projects may form cascades along a river valley, often with a  reservoir-type hydropower plants in the upper reaches of the  valley. run-of-river installation is relatively inexpensive.  facilities typically have lower environmental impacts than  similar-sized storage hydropower plants.  storage hydropower  hydropower projects with a reservoir are also called storage  hydropower. the reservoir reduces dependence on the  variability of inflow, and the generating stations are located at  the dam toe or further downstream, connected to the  reservoir through tunnels or pipelines (figure 10.17).  reservoirs are designed according to the landscape. in many  parts of the world, river valleys are inundated to make an  artificial lake. in geographies with mountain plateaus, highaltitude  lakes are another kind of reservoir that retains many  of the properties of the original lake. in these settings, the  generating station is often connected to the reservoir lake via  tunnels (lake tapping). for example, in scandinavia, natural  high-altitude lakes create high pressure systems where the  heads may reach over 1,000 m. a storage power plant may  have tunnels coming from several reservoirs and may also be  connected to neighbouring watersheds or rivers. large  hydroelectric power plants with concrete dams and extensive  collecting lakes often have very negative effects on the  environment, requiring the flooding of habitable areas.  pumped storage  pumped storage plants generate electricity but are energy  storage devices. in such a system, water is pumped from a  lower reservoir into an upper reservoir (figure 10.18), usually  during off-peak hours when electricity is cheap. the flow is  reversed to generate electricity during the daily peak load  period or at other times of need. the plant is a net energy  consumer overall, because it uses power to pump water;  however, the plant provides system benefits by helping to  meet fluctuating demand profiles. pumped storage is the  largest-capacity form of grid energy storage now readily  available worldwide.  248    in-stream technology using existing facilities  to optimize existing facilities like weirs, barrages, canals or  falls, small turbines or hydrokinetic turbines can be installed  for electricity generation. these basically function like a runof-  river scheme, as shown in figure 10.19. hydrokinetic  devices being developed to capture energy from tides and  currents may also be deployed inland for free-flowing rivers  and engineered waterways.  hydropower – future developments  a relatively small number of equipment suppliers dominate  the market for large hydropower plants (above 10  megawatts). the basic equipment remains the same, though  it has improved efficiency, with additional services ranging  from monitoring and diagnostics to advanced control  systems. more r&d is needed to produce further progress  and reduce the considerable impact of large hydropower on  environmental systems and local communities (irena-hydro-  2015).36 the local population must be consulted before  projects are further developed.  there are 3 classes of hydro power plants:  • large hydropower (>10 mWelectric);  • small hydropower (≤10 mWelectric)  • mini-hydro (100 kWe to 1 mWelectric)  small-scale hydropower (from 1 mW to 10 mW) has a much  wider range of designs, equipment, and material. therefore,  expertise in a wider range of fields is crucial towards tapping  the potential of local resources affordably and without a  detrimental environmental impact (irena-hydro-2015).  upgrades are an excellent way of getting more energy from  existing hydropower facilities – and often the least-cost  option. realistically, 5-10 percent more electricity can be  generated at modest cost. legal and technical hurdles may,  however, hamper repowering, for instance when there is  limited documentation from decades ago. today, it is possible  to accurately analyse local geology and hydrology in advance  in order to assess potential gains from upgrades (irenahydro-  2015). in energy [r]evolution scenarios, up-grading of  existing hydropower plants is of particular importance and  preferred to new builds, especially for large power plants.  greenpeace does not support large hydropower stations  that require large dams and flooding areas but does  support small-scale run-of-river power plants.  10.4.13 ocean energy  wave energy  in wave power generation, a structure interacts with the  incoming waves, converting this energy to electricity through  a hydraulic, mechanical or pneumatic power take-off system.  the structure is moored or placed directly on the  seabed/seashore. power is transmitted to the seabed by a  flexible submerged electrical cable and to shore by a sub-sea  cable. Wave power can potentially provide a predictable  supply of energy and does not create much visual impact.  many wave energy technologies are at an early phase of  conceptual development and testing. power plants designs  vary to deal with different wave motion (heaving, surging,  pitching) water depths (deep, intermediate, shallow) and  distance from shore (shoreline, near-shore, offshore).  shoreline devices are fixed to the coast or embedded in the  shoreline. near-shore devices work at depths of 20-25 m to  ~500 m from the shore, where there are stronger, more  productive waves. offshore devices exploit the more powerful  waves in water over 25 m deep (ipcc-srren 2012).37 no  particular technology is dominant for wave power. several  different systems are being prototyped and tested at sea,  with most development being carried out in uk.    a generic scheme for characterizing ocean wave energy  generation devices consists of primary, secondary and  tertiary conversion stages,38 which refer to the conversions of  kinetic energy (in water) to mechanical energy, and then to  electrical energy in the generator. recent reviews have  identified more than 50 wave energy devices at various  stages of development,39 and we have not explored the limits  of size in practice.  utility-scale electricity generation from wave energy will  require arrays of devices, and like wind turbines, devices are  likely to be chosen for specific site conditions. Wave power  converters can be made up from connected groups of smaller  generator units of 100 – 500 kW, or several mechanical or  hydraulically interconnected modules can supply a single  larger turbine generator unit of 2 – 20 mW. however, large  waves needed to make the technology more cost effective  are mostly a long way from shore which would require costly  sub-sea cables to transmit the power. the converters  themselves also take up large amounts of space.  Wave energy systems may be categorised by their genus,  location and principle of operation as shown in figure 10.20.  oscillating water columns  oscillating water columns use wave motion to induce different  pressure levels between the air-filled chamber and the  atmosphere.40 air is pushed at high speed through an air turbine  coupled to an electrical generator (figure 10.21), creating a pulse  when the wave advances and recedes, as the air flows in two  directions. the air turbine rotates in the same direction, regardless  of the flow. a device can be: a fixed structure above the breaking  waves (cliff-mounted or part of a breakwater); bottom-mounted  near shore; or it can be a floating system moored in deeper waters.  oscillating-body systems  oscillating-body systems use the incident wave motion to make  two bodies move in oscillation to drive the power take-off  system.41 they can be surface devices or, less often, fully  submerged. surface flotation devices are generally referred to  as ‘point absorbers’, because they are non-directional. some  oscillating body devices are fully submerged and rely on  oscillating hydrodynamic pressure to extract the wave energy.  lastly, hinged devices sit on the seabed relatively close to shore  and harness the horizontal surge energy of incoming waves.  overtopping devices  overtopping devices convert wave energy into potential  energy by collecting surging waves into a water reservoir at a  level above the free water surface.42 the reservoir drains  down through a conventional low-head hydraulic turbine.  these systems can float offshore or be incorporated into  shorelines or man-made breakwaters (figure 10.23).  250    power take-off systems  power take-off systems are used to convert the kinetic  energy, air flow or water flow generated by the wave energy  device into a useful form, usually electricity. a large number  of different technology options are described in the  literature.43 the overall concept is that real-time wave  oscillations will produce corresponding electrical power  oscillations. in practice, some method of short-term energy  storage (in seconds) may be needed to smooth energy  delivery. these devices would probably be deployed in arrays  because the cumulative power generated by several devices  will be smoother than from a single device.    tidal range  tidal range hydropower has been tested in estuarine  developments where a barrage encloses an estuary, which  creates a single reservoir (basin) behind it with conventional  low-head hydro turbines in the barrage. alternative  configurations of multiple barrages have been proposed where  basins are filled and emptied at different times, with turbines  located between the basins. multi-basin schemes may offer  more flexible power generation availability than normal schemes  because they could generate power almost continuously.  recent developments focus on single or multiple offshore  basins away from estuaries (‘tidal lagoons’), which could  provide more flexible capacity and output with little or no  impact on delicate estuarine environments. this technology  uses commercially available systems. the conversion  mechanism most widely used to produce electricity from tidal  range is the bulb-turbine.44 examples of power plants with  bulb turbines technology include a 240 mW power plant at la  rance in northern france45 and the 254 mW sihwa barrage in  the republic of korea, which is nearing completion.46  some favourable sites with very gradually sloping coastlines  are well suited to tidal range power plants, such as the severn  estuary between southwest england and south Wales.  current feasibility studies there include options such as  barrages and tidal lagoons. the average capacity factor for  tidal power stations has been estimated from 22.5% to 35%.47  tidal and ocean currents  to capture energy from tidal currents, a device can be fitted  underwater to a column fixed to the sea bed with a rotor to  generate electricity from fast-moving currents, technologies  that extract kinetic energy from tidal and ocean currents are  under development; tidal energy converters are the most  common to date, designed to generate as the tide travels in  both directions. devices types include axial-flow turbines,  cross-flow turbines and reciprocating devices. axial-flow  turbines (figure 10.26 see below) work on a horizontal axis,  while cross-flow turbines may operate about a vertical axis  (figure 10.27 see below) or a horizontal axis with or without  a shroud to accentuate the flow. a single unit can have  multiple turbines (figure 10.27).  marine turbine designs look somewhat like wind turbines but  must contend with reversing flows, cavitation and harsh  underwater marine conditions (salt water corrosion, debris,  fouling, etc.). axial flow turbines must be able to respond to  reversing flow directions, while cross-flow turbines continue  to operate regardless of current flow direction. rotor shrouds  (also known as cowlings or ducts) can enhance  hydrodynamic performance by increasing the speed of water  through the rotor and reducing losses at the tips. some  technologies in the conceptual stage of development are  based on reciprocating devices incorporating hydrofoils or  tidal sails. two prototype oscillating devices have been  trialled at open sea locations in the uk.48  the development of tidal current resources will require  multiple machines deployed in a similar fashion to a wind  farm, and siting will need to take into account wake effects.    capturing the energy of open-ocean current systems is likely to  require the same basic technology as for tidal flows but with  some different infrastructure. deep-water applications may  require neutrally buoyant turbine/generator modules with  mooring lines and anchor systems. they could also be attached  to other structures, such as offshore platforms.50 these  modules will also have hydrodynamic lifting designs to allow for  optimal and flexible vertical positioning.51 systems to capture  energy from open ocean current systems may have larger  rotors, as there is no restriction based on the channel size.  ocean energy – future developments  ocean energy can play a significant role for the power supply  of islands and coastal regions. a combination with offshore  wind farms, ocean energy power plants might help to  integrate larger shares of flexible one-shore and/or solar  photovoltaic electricity. Greenpeace supports the  developments of ocean energy in a sustainable manner.      infrastructure for renewables  With increasing market shares of renewable power  generation, there will be less space for base load power  plants. as a result conventional power plants cannot run in  base load mode anymore, which increases costs of operation  and therefore lowers the profit on each kWh sold. the  integration of large-scale renewable energy requires a variety  of existing grid technologies applied in a new context and  with new operational concepts. this section provides a short  overview of technologies and operational concepts used for  the integration of large shares of renewables and are based  on Greenpeace international’s reports about power grids  published between 2009 and 2014 (Gpi- en 2014).52  smart-grid technology will play a significant role, in particular  by integrating demand-side management into power system  operation. the future power supply will not consist of a few  centralized power plants, but of numerous smaller generation  units, such as solar panels, wind turbines and other  renewable units, partly on the distribution network and partly  concentrated in large power plants (such as offshore wind  farms). smart-grid solutions will help to monitor and integrate  this diversity into power system operation and at the same  time will make interconnection simpler.  the tradeoff is that power system planning will become more  complex due to the larger number of generation assets and  the significant share of variable power generation causing  constantly changing power flows in the power systems.  smart-grid technology will be needed to support power  system planning, i.e. actively support day-ahead planning  and power system balancing by providing real-time  information about the status of the network and the  generation units in combination with weather forecasts.  smart-Grid technology will also play a significant role in  making sure systems can meet the peak demand at all times.  smart-Grid technology will make better use of distribution  and transmission assets, thereby limiting the need for  transmission network extension to the absolute minimum.  smart grids use information and communication  technology (ict) to enable a power system based on  renewable energy sources.  ict in smart grids is used to:  • easily interconnect a large number of renewable generation  assets into the power system (plug and play)  • create a more flexible power system through large-scale  demand-side management and by integrating storage to  balance the impact of variable renewable generation resources  • provide the system operator with a better information about  the state of the system, which so they can operate the  system more efficiently  • minimize network upgrades using of network assets  efficiently and supporting an efficient coordination of power  generation over very large geographic areas needed for  renewable energy generation.  10.5.1 demand side management  in reality, load varies over time which means that additional  flexible power generation resources are required to provide  the right amount of power. for rural areas, typical  technologies are combined-cycle gas turbines (ccGt) or  hydro-power stations with a sufficient storage capacity to  follow the daily load variations. in conventional island power  systems, typically a number of small diesel generators (gensets)  are used to provide 24/7 supply. several gen-sets have  to operate continuously at the point of their highest efficiency,  while one is used to follow the load variations.  the impact of adding renewable power generation to a  conventionally centralized or island power system will affect  the way in which a conventionally designed electricity system  runs. the level of impact depends on the renewable energy  technology: biomass, geothermal-, concentrated solar- and  hydropower with storage can regulate power output and  therefore can supply base load as well as peak load.  hydropower without storage (run–of- river), photovoltaic and  wind power depends on the available natural resources, so  the power output is variable. sometimes these renewable  energy sources are sometimes described as ‘intermittent’  power sources; however, the terminology is not correct as  intermittent stands for uncontrollable, i.e. non-dispatchable,  but the power output of these generation plants can be  forecast, so they can be dispatched.  furthermore, they can always be ramped down if  needed.there are two main types of impacts to consider  when introducing renewable energy to micro-grids: the  balancing impact and reliability impact.  balancing impact to relates to the short-term adjustments  needed to manage fluctuations over a period ranging from  minutes to hours before the time of delivery. in power systems  without variable power generation, there can be a mismatch  between demand and supply. the reasons could be that the  energy load was not forecast correctly, or a conventional  power plant is not operating as it is scheduled, for instance  when a power station trips due to a technical problem.  adding a variable power generation source increases the risk  that the forecast power generation in the power system will not  be reached, for instance due to a weather system moving  faster than predicted into the area. the overall impact on the  system depends on how large and how widely distributed the  variable power sources are. a certain amount of wind power  distributed over a larger geographical area will have a lower  254    impact on system balancing than the same amount of wind  power concentrated in one single location, as geographical  distribution will smoothen out the renewable power generation.  system balancing is relevant to:  • Day-ahead planning, which needs to make sure that sufficient  generation is available to match expected demand taking  into account forecasted generation from variable power  generation sources (typically 12 to 36 hours ahead);  • short-term system balancing, which allocates balancing  resources to cover events such as a mismatch between  forecasted generation/demand or sudden loss of  generation (typically seconds to hours ahead planning).  in island power systems, both aspects must be handled  automatically by the system.  reliability impact is the extent to which sufficient generation  will be available to meet peak demands at all times. no  electricity system can be 100% reliable, since there will  always be a small chance of major failures in power stations  or transmission lines when demand is high. as renewable  power production is often more distributed than conventional  large-scale power plants, it reduces the risk of sudden dropouts  of major individual production units. on the other hand,  variable renewable power generation reduces the probability  that generation is available at the time of high demand, thus  adding complexity to system planning.  reliability is important for long-term system planning, which  assesses the system adequacy typically two to 10 years  ahead. long-term system planning with variable generation  sources is a challenge, because of the actual geographical  location of the resource. to get a high level of renewable  energy into the system, it ideally must be situated at some  distance from each other, for example using solar power from  southern europe when there is no or limited wind power  available in northern europe.  in island power systems, all power generation is typically  close to each other, which means that there must be a mix of  different generation technologies in the island system or that  they must be partly over-designed to make sure that there is  always sufficient generation capacity available. this is  typically done by adding some back-up diesel gen-sets. in  addition, island power systems can adjust power demand to  meet power supply, rather than the other way round. this  approach is called demand-side management. an example of  a “flexible” load in island systems for demand-side  management is water pumps and irrigation pumps, which can  be turned on and off depending on how much electricity  supply there is.  10.5.2 “overlay” or “super grid” – the interconnection  of smart grids  based on the current technology development of energy  storage technologies, it is difficult to envision that energy  storage could provide a comprehensive solution to this  challenge. While different storage technologies such as  electrochemical batteries are already available today, it is not  clear whether large-scale electricity storage, other than  pumped hydropower described in the previous section, will  become technically and economically viable.  feasible storage systems would have to cover most of the  european electricity supply during up to two successive  weeks of low solar radiation and little wind – difficult to  envision based on current technology development. to  design a power system that can adequately react to such  extreme situations, a substantial amount of planning is  needed in order to ensure available generation capacity  together with sufficient network capacity to match demand.  different timescales must be considered:  • long-term system plans to assess the system adequacy  over the coming years (typically a time horizon of 2 to 10  years ahead)  • day-ahead planning, making sure that sufficient generation  is available to match expected demand (typically 12 to 36  hours ahead)  • short-term balancing, covering events such as a mismatch  between forecasted generation/demand or sudden loss of  generation (typically seconds to hours-ahead planning)  benefits of a super grid  starting around 1920, each load center in europe had its own  isolated power system. With the development of transmission  lines using higher voltages, the transport of power over larger  distances became feasible. soon, the different centers were  interconnected. in the beginning, only stations in the same  region were interconnected. over the years, technology  developed further, and maximum possible transmission line  voltage increased step by step.  there were two main drivers of extending network structure:  • larger transmission networks and high voltage lines meant  suppliers could follow the aggregated demand of a large  number of customers, instead of the demand variation of  one customer - which can change significantly over time -  with one generation resource. the demand of those  aggregated customers became easier to predict and  generation scheduling therefore significantly easier.  • the larger transmission networks created economies of  scale by installing larger generation units. in the 1930s, the  most cost-effective size of thermal power stations was  about 60 mW. in the 1950s, it was 180 mW, and by the  1980s about 1,000 mW. this approach made only    is less than With hvac overhead lines.  economic sense because extending the power system was  cheaper than adding local generation capacity.  the approach includes some major risks, like the failure of a  large power station or the interruption of a major transmission  line, which can interrupt of the power system over a large  area. to be better prepared for such situations national  transmission systems in europe and elsewhere were  interconnected across borders. countries can help each  other in case of emergency situations by cooperating in the  organization of spinning reserve, reserve capacity and  frequency control.  shifting to an energy mix with over 90% of the electricity  supply coming from renewable energy sources will also  require a significant redesign of the transmission network to  adapt to the needs of the new generation structure. the right  kind of grid provides an economic, reliable and sustainable  energy supply.  in principal, over-sizing local generation locally would reduce  the need for large-scale renewable generation elsewhere as  well as upgrading the transmission network. in this case the  local power system will evolve into a hybrid system that can  operate without any outside support.  however, making local plants bigger (over-sized) is less  economical than installing large-scale renewable energy  plants at a regional scale and integrating them into the power  system via extended transmission lines. the allocation of  70% distributed renewable generation and 30% large-scale  renewable generation is not based on a detailed technical or  economic optimization; in each location, the optimum mix is  specific to local conditions. further detailed studies on  regional levels will be needed to better quantify the split  between distributed and large-scale renewable generation  better.  an appropriately designed transmission system is the  solution in both cases as it can be used to transmit the  required electricity from areas with surplus of generation to  areas that have an electricity deficit.  in general, the transmission system must be designed to  cope with:  • long-term issues: extreme variations in the availability of  natural resources from one year to another; for instance,  the output of wind turbines in any given area can vary by up  to 30% from one year to the next. for hydropower, the  variations can be even larger  • medium-term issues: extreme combinations in the availability  of natural resources, such as no wind over main parts of  europe during the winter, when solar radiation is low  • short-term issues: significant mismatch between  forecasted wind or solar production and actual production  with significant impact on power system operation in the  range of 15 minutes to 3 hours  • loss of a significant amount of generation due to  unscheduled break-down or network interruption, impact  within milliseconds. the mainland european power system  is currently designed to cope with a maximum sudden  generation loss of 3,000 mW. Whether this level is sufficient  for the future depends, for example, on the maximum  transmission capacity of a single transmission line. most  likely the maximum transmission capacity of a single  transmission in the future hvdc super Grid will exceed a  capacity of 3,000 mW; hence, sufficient spare generation  and/or network capacity must be considered when  redesigning the power system (considered in the simulation  report by loading the super Grid to a maximum of 70%).  super grid transmission options  in principal different technical options exists for the redesign  of the onshore transmission network. in the following, the  following technical options are briefly presented, followed by  a general comparison.  • hvac (high voltage alternating current)  • hvdc lcc (high voltage direct current system using line  commutated converter)  • hvdc vsc (high voltage direct current system using  voltage source converter)  • other technical solutions  10.5.3 hvac  high voltage ac transmission (hvac) using overhead lines  has become a leading technology in electrical networks.53 its  advantage is in using transformers to increase the typical,  rather low voltage from the generators to higher voltage  levels, which is a significantly cheaper approach than the  ac/dc converter stations for the hvdc technologies.  transmission over long distances with low or medium voltage  will result in high and prohibitively expensive losses, so high  voltage ac (400 kv or more) over medium distance (a few  hundred kilometers) is typically the most cost effective  solution. as ac systems develop, there are increases in  transmission voltage. typically, doubling the voltage  quadruples the power transfer capability. consequently, the  evolution of grids in most countries is characterized by the  addition of network layers of higher and higher voltages.  today, the highest hvac voltage used is around 800 kv for  overhead lines. the canadian company hydro Quebec, for  instance, operates a massive 735 kv transmission system  using overhead lines; the first line was in operation 1965.  1000 kv and 1200 kv ac has been tested in several test-    installations and even short-term commercial applications.  there are several challenges involved in building such lines  and new equipment needing to be developed includes  transformers, breakers, transformers, and switches.  the major advantage of an ac-based system is the flexibility  with which loads and generation along the route can be  connected. this is especially important if the transmission  route passes through a highly populated area and if many  local generation facilities are located at many places along  the route. the disadvantage of hvac systems are the  comparatively high costs for transmission of large capacity (>  1,000 mW) over very long distances (> 1000 km) due to the  additional equipment required for keeping the voltage level on  the overhead lines, for instance.  10.5.4 hvdc lcc  the advantage of line commutated converter (lcc) high  voltage dc (hvdc) connections is certainly their proven track  record. the first commercial lcc hvdc link was installed in  1954 between the island of Gotland and the swedish  mainland. the link was 96 km long, rated at 20 mW, and used  a 100 kv submarine cable. since then, lcc based hvdc  technology has been installed in many locations in the world,  primarily for bulk power transmission over long geographical  distances and for interconnecting power systems, such as  island systems in japan and new Zealand. other well-known  examples for conventional hvdc technology are:  • the 1,354 km pacific interie dc link with a rating of 3,100  mW at a dc voltage of ± 500 kv  • the itaipu link between brazil and paraguay, rated at 6,300  mW at a dc voltage of ± 600 kv (2 bipoles x 3,150 mW)  the total conversion efficiency from ac to dc and back to ac  using the two converters lies in the range of 97 to 98 % and  depends on the design details of the converter stations. a  system design with a 98 % efficiency will have higher  investment costs compared to a design with lower efficiency.  the advantage of an lcc hvdc solution are comparatively  low losses – in the order of 2-3 % for a 500 mW transmission  over 100 km, including losses in converters and transmission.  in addition, the higher transmission capacity of a single cable  compared to hvac transmission and voltage source  converter transmission can be an advantage when  transmitting large capacities. the disadvantage of the hvdc  lcc design is lack of power system support capability.  typically, a strong hvac network is required on both sites of  the hvdc lcc connection. hence, building up an entire  hvdc back-bone network using hvdc lcc technology that  has to support the underlying hvac network is technically  challenging and only possible with the installation of  additional equipment such as statcoms (= static  synchronous compensator).  10.5.5 hvdc vsc  the voltage source converter (vsc) based hvdc technology is  capturing more and more attention. this comparatively new  technology has only become possible due to advances in high  power electronics, namely insulated Gate bipolar transistors  (iGbts). pulse Width modulation (pWm) can then be used for the  vsc converter, as opposed to the thyristor line-commutated  converters used in conventional hvdc technology.  the first commercial vsc-based hvdc link was installed by  abb on the swedish island of Gotland in 1999. it is 70 km  long, with 60 mva at ± 80 kv. the link was mainly built in order  to provide voltage support for the large amount of wind power  installed in the south of Gotland. today about 10 vsc-based  hvdc links are in operation world-wide. key projects are:  • in 2000, the murraylink was built in australia with a length  of almost 180 km. this connection was the longest vscbased  hvdc link in the world until 2009. it has a capacity  of 220 mva at a dc voltage of ±150 kv  • the bard offshore 1 project borWind in Germany connects  a 400 mW offshore wind farm to the onshore grid using a  203 km long cable, operating at a dc voltage of ±150 kv  • the longest hvdc vsc project is the caprivi link in  namibia. it is 970 km long and operates at ±350 kv, the  highest voltage level used so far for hvdc vsc projects, to  transmit a capacity of 300 mW.  the total efficiency of a vsc-based hvdc system is slightly  less than that of a lcc hvdc system, but efficiency is  expected to improve with future technical development. also,  rating per converter is presently limited to approximately 400-  500 mW, while the cable rating at +/-150 kv is 600 mW. more  cable and converter stations are required for a vsc-based  hvdc solution compared to an lcc-based hvdc solution;  however, manufacturers are already working on converter  stations with higher ratings and increased cable ratings. the  significant advantages of vsc-based hvdc solutions are its  power system support capabilities, such as independent  control of active and reactive power. in addition, a vscbased  hvdc link does not require a strong ac network, it can  even start up against a non-load network. building up a vscbased  hvdc backbone network will be technically easier  than using lcc-based hvdc technology. however, multiterminal  vsc hvdc systems are also new for the power  system industry, so there will a learning curve to achieve it.    comparison of transmission solutions  table 10.2 compares the three standard transmission  solutions. the technical capabilities of each system can  probably be improved by adding additional equipment to the  overall system solution.  the cost of transmitting electricity is dominated by the  investment cost of the transmission lines and by the  electricity losses during transmission. at present, overhead  lines are predominant since costs of overhead lines are about  20 % of that for ground cables. the transmission losses of  hvac overhead lines are roughly twice as high as those of  hvdc. on the one hand, the cost of overhead lines is similar  for the lower voltage level, but at 800 kv hvdc lines are  much less expensive than comparable ac lines. on the other  hand, ac/dc converter stations for hvdc technology are  considerably more expensive than the transformer stations of  ac systems. therefore, for shorter distances and lower  voltages ac is typically the most economical solution, while  hvdc lines are applied at distances well over 500 km.  258    the most economical system design is typically a  combination of hvac and hvdc technology. hvac is a cost-effective  and flexible solution over medium distances (up to  1,000 km), for instance to distribute power along the route to  different load centers or to collect locally distributed  generation and transmit the surplus electricity to other  regions. hvdc technology can be used as an overlaying  network structure to transmit bulk power, i.e. large capacity,  over long distances to the areas where the energy is needed.  an hvdc super Grid will have only a very limited number of  connection points, because the substation (converter station)  costs are significant.  in addition, an hvac solution will require significantly more  lines than hvdc solutions. the transmission of 10,000 mW or  10 GW, for instance, can be achieved with two lines using  800 kv and applying lcc hvdc technology, while transmitting  the same power with 800 kv ac would require five lines. for a  given transmission capacity of 10 GW, the space requirement  of hvdc overhead lines can be four times lower than that of  hvac lines (figure 10.29). While an 800 kv hvac line would  require a width of 425 meters over the total length of a power  link of 10 GW, a hvdc line of the same capacity would only  require a width of 100 meters. there are thus considerable  differences in the environmental impact of both technologies.  a final advantage of using hvdc technology is that it is easier  to move the entire hvdc super grid underground by using  hvdc cables. this approach will be more costly, but  following existing transporting routes (laying the cables along  motorways, railway tracks or even in rivers) will allow a fast  roll-out of the hvdc supergrid infrastructure and reduce the  visual impact of the installation.  10.6 renewable heating and cooling  technologies  renewable heating and cooling has a long tradition in human  culture. heat can come from the sun (solar thermal), the earth  (geothermal), ambient heat and plant matter (biomass). solar  heat for drying processes and wood stoves for cooking have  been used for so long that they are labeled “traditional”, but  today’s technologies are far from old-fashioned. over the last  decade, there have been improvements to a range of  traditional applications, many of which are already  economically competitive with fossil-fuel based technologies  or starting to be.  this chapter presents the current range of renewable heating  and cooling technologies and gives a short outlook of the  most sophisticated technologies, integrating multiple  suppliers and users in heat networks or even across various  renewable energy sources in heating and cooling systems.  some of the emerging areas for this technology are space  heating / cooling and industrial process heat.  10.6.1 solar thermal technologies  solar thermal energy has been used for the production of  heat for centuries but has become more popular and  developed commercially for the last thirty years. solar thermal  collecting systems are based on a centuries-old principle: the  sun heats up water contained in a dark vessel.  the technologies on the market now are efficient and highly  reliable, providing energy for a wide range of applications in  domestic and commercial buildings, swimming pools, for  industrial process heat, in cooling and the desalination for  drinking water.  although mature products exist to provide domestic hot water  and space heating using solar energy, in most countries they  are not yet the norm. a big step towards an energy  [r]evolution is integrating solar thermal technologies into  buildings at the design stage or when the heating (and cooling)  system is being replaced, lowering the installation cost.  swimming pool heating  pools can make simple use of free heating, using unglazed  water collectors. they are mostly made of plastic, have no  insulation and reach temperatures just a few degrees above  ambient temperature. collectors used for heating swimming  pools and are either installed on the ground or on a nearby  rooftop; and they pump swimming pool water through the  collector directly. the size of such a system depends on the  size of the pool as well as the seasons in which the pool is  used. the collector area needed is about 50 % to 70 % of the  pool surface. the average size of an unglazed water collector  system installed in europe is about 200 m2.54  figure 10.29 | comparison of the required number  of parallel pylons and space to transfer 10 gw of  electric capacity    domestic hot water systems  the major application of solar thermal heating so far is for  domestic hot water systems. depending on the conditions  and the system’s configuration, most of a building’s hot water  requirements can be provided by solar energy. larger systems  can additionally cover a substantial part of the energy needed  for space heating. two major collector types are:  vacuum tubes  the absorber inside the vacuum tube absorbs radiation from  the sun and heats up the fluid inside. additional radiation is  picked up from the reflector behind the tubes. Whatever the  angle of the sun, the round shape of the vacuum tube allows  it to reach the absorber. even on a cloudy day, when the light  is coming from many angles at once, the vacuum tube  collector can still be effective. most of the world’s installed  systems are this type, especially in the world’s largest market:  china. this collector type consists of a row of evacuated glass  tubes with the absorber placed inside. due to the evacuated  environment, there are less heat losses. the systems can  reach operating temperatures of at least 120 °c; however, the  typical use of this collector type is in the range of 60°c to  80°c. evacuated tube collectors are more efficient than  standard flat-plate collectors but generally also more costly.  flat plate or flat panel  this is basically a box with a glass cover which sits on the  roof like a skylight. inside is a series of copper or aluminium  tubes with copper fins attached. the entire structure is  coated in a black substance designed to capture the sun’s  rays. in general, flat plate collectors are not evacuated. they  can reach temperatures of about 30°c to 80°c55 and are the  most common collector type in europe.  there are two different way how the water flow is handle in  solar heating, which influences the overall system cost.  thermo-siphon systems  the simple form of a thermo-siphon solar thermal system uses  gravity as a natural way to transfer hot water from the collector  to the storage tank. no pump or control station is needed, and  many are applied as direct systems without a heat exchanger,  which reduces system costs. the thermo-siphon is relatively  compact, making installation and maintenance quite easy. the  storage tank of a thermo-siphon system is usually applied right  above the collector on the rooftop and directly exposed to the  seasons. these systems are typical in warm climates, due to  their lower efficiency compared with forced circulation  systems. the most common problems are heat losses and the  risk of freezing; they are therefore not suitable for areas where  temperatures drop below freezing. in southern europe, a  system like this is capable of providing almost the total hot  water demand of a household. however, the largest market for  thermo-siphon systems is china. in europe, thermo-siphon  solar hot water systems are 95% of private installations in  Greece56, followed by 25% and 15% of newly installed systems  in italy and spain newly in 2009.57  260    pumped systems  the majority of systems installed in europe are forced  circulation (pumped) systems, which are far more complex  and expensive than thermosiphon systems. typically, the  storage tank is situated inside the house (for instance in the  cellar). an automatic control pump circulates the water  between the storage tank and the collector. forced circulation  systems are normally installed with a heat exchanger, which  means they have two circuits. they are mostly used in areas  with low outside temperatures, and antifreeze additives might  have to be added to the solar circuit to protect the water from  freezing and destroying the collector.  even though forced circulation systems are more efficient  than thermosiphon systems, they are mostly not capable of  supplying the full hot water demand in cold areas and are  usually combined with a back-up system, such as heat  pumps, pellet heaters or conventional gas or oil boilers. the  solar coverage of a system is the share of energy provided by  the solar system in relation to total heat consumption, such  as space heating or hot water. solar coverage levels depend  on the heat demand, the outside temperature and the system  design. for hot water production, a solar coverage of 60% in  central europe is common at the current state of technology  development. the typical collector area installed for a  domestic hot water system in a single family house in the eu  27 is 3-6 m2. for multifamily houses and hotels, the size of  installations is much bigger, with a typical size of 50 m2.58,59,60  domestic heat systems  besides domestic hot water systems, solar thermal energy for  space heating systems is becoming increasingly relevant in  european countries. in fact, the eu 28 is the largest market for  this application at the moment, with Germany and austria as the  main driving forces. the collectors used for these applications  are, however, the same as for domestic hot water systems for  solar space heating purposes, though only pumped systems are  suitable. effectively most systems used are so called combisystems  that provide space as well as water heating.  so far, most installations are built on single-family houses with  a typical system size between 6 and 16 m2 and a typical  annual solar coverage of 25 % in central europe.58,59,60  solar combi-systems for multiple family houses are not yet used  very frequently. these systems are about 50 m2, cost  approximately 470-550 €/m2 and have annual solar coverage of  25% in central europe.58,59,60 large scale solar thermal  applications connected to a local or district heating grids with a  collector area above 500 m2 are not so common. however, since  1985, an increasing number of such systems have been installed  per year in the eu with a typical annual solar coverage of 15 % in  central europe.58,59,60 to get a significant solar share, large storage  is needed. the typical solar coverage of such a system including  storage is around 50 % today. With seasonal storage, the  coverage may be increased to about 80 %.59 another option for  domestic heating systems is air collector systems (not described  here). the largest markets for air collectors are in north america  and asia; these systems have a very small penetration on the  european market, though it has been increasing in recent years.  process heat  solar thermal use for industrial process heat is receiving some  attention for development, although it is hardly in use today.  standardized systems are not available because industrial  processes are often individually designed. also, solar thermal  applications are mostly not capable of providing 100 % of the  heat required over a year, so another non-solar heat source  would be necessary for commercial use.  depending on the temperature level needed, different  collectors have been developed to serve the requirements for  process heat. flat plates or evacuated tube collectors provide  a temperature range up to 80 °c. a large number are available  on the market. for temperatures between 80°c and 120°c  advanced flat-plate collectors are available, such as with  multiple glazing, antireflective coatings, evacuated tubes, and  an inert gas filling. other options are flat-plate and evacuated  tube collectors with compound parabolic concentrators  (cpc). these collectors can be stationary and are generally  constructed to concentrate solar radiation by a factor of 1 to  2. they can use most diffuse radiation, which makes them  especially attractive for areas with low direct solar radiation.  there are a few conceptual designs to reach higher  temperatures between 80°c and 180°c, primarily using a  parabolic trough or linear concentrating fresnel collectors.  these collector types have a higher concentration factor than  cpc collectors, are only capable of using direct solar  radiation, and have to be combined with sun tracking  systems. the collectors especially designed for heat use are  most suitable for a temperature range between 150°c and  250 °c.61 air collector systems for process heat are limited to  lower temperatures, being mostly used for to drying purposes  (hay, etc.); they are not discussed here.  cooling  solar chillers use thermal energy to produce cooling and/or  dehumidify the air in a similar way to a refrigerator or  conventional air-conditioning. this application is well-suited to  solar thermal energy, as the demand for cooling is often  greatest when there is most sunshine. solar cooling has been  successfully demonstrated. large-scale use can be expected  in the future but is still not common.    the option to use solar heat this way makes sense because  hot regions require more cooling for comfort. solar thermal  cooling is mostly designed as a closed-loop sorption system  (see box 10.1). the most common application, however, is a  solar absorption cooling unit. the system requires  temperatures above 80°c, which means evacuated tube  collectors, advanced flat-plate collectors and compound  parabolic concentrators. the solar field required for a cooling  unit is about 4 m2 per kW of cooling capacity.  box 10.1 | sorption cooling units  a thermo-chemical refrigerant cycle (sorption) provides cold  by either absorption or adsorption cooling. absorption occurs  when a gaseous or liquid substance is taken up by another  substance, such as the solution of a gas in a liquid.  adsorption takes place when a liquid or gaseous substance is  bound to the surface of a solid material.  the absorption cooling circle can be described as follows: a  liquid refrigerant with a very low boiling point is vaporized at low  pressure, withdrawing heat from its environment and therefore  providing the desired cooling. the gaseous refrigerant is then  absorbed by a liquid solvent, mostly water. the refrigerant and  solvent are separated again by adding (renewable) heat to the  system, making use of the different boiling points. the gaseous  refrigerant is now condensed, released and returned to the  beginning of the process. the heat needed in the process can  be provided by firing natural gas, combined heat and power  plants, solar thermal collectors, etc.  10.6.2 geothermal, hydrothermal and aero-thermal  energy  the three categories of environmental heat are geothermal,  hydrothermal and aero-thermal energy. Geothermal energy is  the energy stored in the earth’s crust, i.e. in rock and  subsurface fluids. the main source of geothermal energy is  the internal heat flow from the earth’s mantle and core into  the crust, which itself is replenished mainly by heat from the  decay of radioactive isotopes. at depths of a few meters, the  soil is also warmed by the atmosphere. Geothermal energy is  available all year round, 24 hours a day, and is independent  of climatic conditions. hydrothermal energy is the energy  stored in surface waters - rivers, lakes, and the sea.  hydrothermal energy is available permanently at temperature  level similar to that of shallow geothermal energy. aerothermal  energy is the thermal energy stored in the earth’s  atmosphere, which originally comes from the sun, but has  been buffered by the atmosphere. aero-thermal energy is  available uninterruptedly, albeit with variations in energy  content due to climatic and regional differences.  deep geothermal energy (geothermal reservoirs)  on average, the crust’s temperature increases by 25-30°c  per km, reaching around 100°c at 3 km depth in most  regions of the world. high temperature fields with that reach  over 180°c can be found at this depth in areas with volcanic  activity. “deep geothermal reservoirs” generally refer to  geothermal reservoirs more than 400m deep, where reservoir  temperatures typically exceed 50°c. depending on reservoir  temperature, deep geothermal energy is used to generate  electricity and/or to supply hot water for various thermal  applications, such as for district heat, balneology, etc.  temperatures in geothermal reservoirs less that 400m deep  are typically below 30°c, which is too low for most direct use  applications or electricity production. in these shallow fields,  heat pumps are applied to increase the temperature level of  the heat extracted from shallow geothermal reservoirs.  the use of geothermal energy for heating purposes or for the  generation of electricity depends on the availability of steam  or hot water as a heat transfer medium. in hydrothermal  systems, hot water or water vapor can be tapped directly  from the reservoir. technologies to exploit hydrothermal  systems are already well established and are in operation in  many parts of the world. however, there is limited availability  of aquifers with sufficient temperature and water production  rate at favorable depths. in europe, high temperature (above  180°c) hydrothermal reservoirs, generally containing steam,  are found in iceland and italy.  hydrothermal systems with aquifer lowers temperatures  (below 180°c) can also be used to produce electricity and  heat in other regions. they contain warm water or a watersteam  mixture. in contrast to hydrothermal systems, eGs  systems do not require a hot aquifer; the heat carrier is the  rock itself. they can thus virtually found everywhere. the  natural permeability of these reservoirs generally does not  allow a sufficient water flow from the injection to the  production well, so energy projects require the artificial  injection of water into the reservoir, which they do by  fracturing rock underground. Water is injected from the  surface into the reservoir, where the surrounding rock acts as  a heat exchanger. the heated water is pumped back to the  surface to supply a power plant or a heating network. While  enhanced geothermal systems promise large potentials both  for electricity generation and direct use, they are still in the  pre-commercialization phase.  direct use of geothermal energy  (deep) geothermal heat from aquifers and deep reservoirs  can be used directly in hydrothermal heating plants to supply  heat demand nearby or in a district heating network.  networks provide space heat, hot water in households and  health facilities or low temperature process heat (industry,  agriculture and services). in the surface unit, hot water from  the production well is either directly fed into a heat  distribution network (“open loop system”), or heat is    transferred from the geothermal fluid to a secondary heat  distribution network via heat exchangers (“closed loop  system”). heating network temperatures are typically in the  range 60-100°c. however, higher temperatures are possible  if wet or dry steam reservoirs are exploited or if heat pumps  are switched into the heat distribution circuit. in these cases,  geothermal energy may also supply process heat applications  requiring temperatures above 100°c.  direct use provides heating and cooling for buildings  including district heating, fish ponds, greenhouses, bathing,  wellness and swimming pools, water  purification/desalination, and industrial and process heat for  agricultural products and mineral extraction and drying  (ipcc-srren 2012).62  for space heating, two basic types of systems are used: open  and closed loops. open loop (single pipe) systems directly  utilize the geothermal water extracted from a well to circulate  through radiators (figure 10.31, top). closed loop (double  pipe) systems use heat exchangers to transfer heat from the  geothermal water to a closed loop that circulates heated  freshwater through the radiators (figure 10.31; bottom).  alternatively, deep borehole heat exchangers can exploit the  relatively high temperature at depths between 300 and  3,000 m (20 – 110°c). heat pumps can be used to increase  the temperature of the useful heat, if required. the overall  efficiency of geothermal heat use can be raised if several  thermal direct-use applications with successive lower  temperature levels are connected in series (cascades). for  example, dry steam at 250°c can be fed to a cogeneration  plant for electricity, the co-generated heat then fed into a  district heating network at 80°c, and the waste heat at 40°c  used to warm fishing ponds. the main costs for deep geothermal  projects are in drilling.  simultaneous production of electricity and heat  in many cases, geothermal power plants also produce heat to  supply a district heating network. there are two different  options for using heat: one where the geothermal fluid is  separated into two streams separately used either for power  production or to feed the heat network; or a heat exchanger  transfers thermal energy from the geothermal fluid to the  working fluid, which feeds the turbines. after the heat exchange  process, the leftover heat from the geothermal fluid can be used  for heating purposes. in both cases, after the electricity  production in the turbines waste heat is not captured as it is for  cogeneration (chp), but released into the environment.  source ipcc 2012: special report on renewable energy sources and climate change mitigation. prepared by Working Group iii of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, cambridge university press.    a heat pump is a device that transfers heat from one fluid at  a lower temperature to another at a higher temperature.  thus, it allows heat to be carried from a lower to a higher  temperature level. the function of the heat pump may  therefore be compared to that of a water pump positioned  between two water basins connected to each other but  located at different altitudes: water will naturally flow from the  higher to the lower basin. it is, however, possible to return  water to the higher basin by using a pump, which draws  water from the lower one.  a heat pump consists of a closed circuit through which a  special fluid (refrigerant) flows. this fluid takes on a liquid or  gaseous state according to temperature and pressure  conditions. the condenser and the evaporator consist of heat  exchangers, i.e. special tubes placed in contact with service  fluids (such as air) in which the refrigerant flows. the latter  transfer heat to the condenser (the high temperature side)  and takes it away from the evaporator (the low temperature  side). electric power is required to operate heat pumps,  making them an efficient way of electric heating.  heat pumps have become increasingly important in buildings but  can also be used for industrial process heat. industrial heat  pumps (ihps) offer various opportunities to all types of  manufacturing processes and operations and use waste process  heat as the heat source, deliver heat at higher temperature for  use in industrial processes, heating or preheating, or for space  heating and cooling in industry. the introduction of heat pumps  with operating temperature below 100 °c are state of the art  technologies while higher temperature applications still require  additional r&d activities.54  heat pumps use the refrigeration cycle to provide heating,  cooling and sanitary hot water. they employ renewable energy  from ground, water and air to move heat from a relatively low  temperature reservoir (the “source”) to the temperature level of  the desired thermal application (the “output”). heat pumps  commonly use two types of refrigeration cycles:  • compression heat pumps use mechanical energy, most  commonly electric motors or combustion engines to drive  the compressor in the unit. consequently, electricity, gas or  oil is used as auxiliary energy.  • thermally driven heat pumps use thermal energy to drive  the sorption process - either adsorption or absorption - to  make ambient heat useful. different energy sources can be  used as auxiliary energy: waste energy, biomass, solar  thermal energy or conventional fuels.  compression heat pumps are most commonly used today;  however, thermally driven units are seen as a promising future  technology. the “efficiency” of a heat pump is described by  the coefficient of power (cop) - the ratio between the annual  useful heat output and the annual auxiliary energy  consumption of the unit. in the residential market, heat  pumps work best for relatively warm heat sources and lowtemperature  applications such as space heating and sanitary  hot water. they are less efficient for providing higher  temperature heat and can’t be used for heat over 90°c. for  industrial applications, different refrigerants can be used to  provide heat from 80°c to 90°c efficiently, so they are only  suitable for part of the energy requirements of industry.  heat pumps are generally distinguished by the heat source  they exploit:  • Ground source heat pumps use the energy stored in the  ground at depths from around hundred meters up to the  surface. they are used for deep borehole heat exchangers  (300 – 3,000m), shallow borehole heat exchangers (50-  250m) and horizontal borehole heat exchangers (a few  meters deep).  • Water source heat pumps are coupled to a (relatively warm)  water reservoir of around 10°c, such as wells, ponds,  rivers, and the sea.  • aero-thermal heat pumps use the outside air as heat  source. as outside temperatures during the heating period  are generally lower than soil and water temperature, ground  source and water source heat pumps typically more  efficient than aero-thermal heat pumps.  heat pumps require additional energy apart from the  environmental heat extracted from the heat source, so the  environmental benefit of heat pumps depends on both their  efficiency and the emissions related to the production of the  working energy. Where the heat pump has low cop and a  high share of electricity from coal power plants, for example,  carbon dioxide emissions relative to useful heat production  might be higher than conventional gas condensing boilers. on  the other hand, efficient heat pumps powered with “green”  electricity are 100% emission-free solutions that contribute  significantly to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions  when used in place of fossil-fuel fired heating systems.  box 10.2 | typical heat pump specifications  usually provide hot water or space heat at lower  temperatures, around 35°c.  example uses: underfloor/wall heating.  typical size for space heating a single family house  purposes: approx. 5-10 kW thermal  typical size for space heating a large office building: >100  kW thermal.  aero-thermal heat pumps do not require drilling, which  significantly reduces system costs compared to other types.  if waste heat from fossil fuel fired processes is used as heat  source for this technology, the heat provided cannot be  classified as “renewable” - it becomes merely an efficient way  of making better use of energy otherwise wasted.    heat pumps for cooling  reversible heat pumps can be operated both in heating and in  cooling mode. When running in cooling mode in summer, heat  is extracted from the building and “pumped” into the  underground reservoir, which is then heated. in this way, the  temperature of the warm reservoir in the ground is restored  after its exploitation in winter.  alternatively, renewable cooling could be provided by  circulating a cooling fluid through the relatively cool ground  before being distributed in a building’s heating/cooling system  (“free cooling”). however, this cooling fluid must not be based  on chemicals that are damaging to the upper atmosphere,  such as hfcs (a strong greenhouse gas) or cfcs (ozonedepleting  gas).  in principle, high enthalpy geothermal heat might provide the  energy needed to drive an absorption chiller. however, only a  very limited number of geothermal absorption chillers are in  operation world-wide.  box 10.3 | district heat networks  heat networks are preferably used in populated areas such as  large cities. their advantages include a reduction of local  emissions, higher efficiency (in particular with cogeneration),  and less need for infrastructures that go along with individual  heating solutions. Generally heat from all sources can be used  in heat networks. however, some applications like cogeneration  technologies have a special need for a secure heat demand  provided by heat networks to be able to operate economically.  managing the variations in heat supply and demand is vital for  high shares of renewables, which is more challenging for space  heat and hot water than for electricity. heat networks help even  out peaks in demand by connecting a large number of clients,  and supply can be adjusted by tapping various renewable  sources and relatively cheap storage options. the use of an  existing heat network for renewable heat depends on the  competitiveness of the new heat applications or plants. the  development of new networks, however, is not an easy task.  the factors to assess whether a new heat network is  economically competitive compared to other heating and  cooling options are:  • heat density (heat demand per area) of building  infrastructure, depending on housing density and the  specific heat demand of the buildings  • obligation to connect to the network (leads to higher  effective heat density)  • existing building infrastructure and newly developed areas,  where network installation can be integrated in building site  preparation  • existence of competing infrastructures such as gas networks  • size of the heat network and distance to the remotest client  figure 10.32 | examples for heat pump systems. left: air source heat pump, middle: ground source heat pump with horizontal  collector, right: water source heat pump (open loop system with two wells)  source German heat pump association (bWp).  10.6.4 biomass heating technologies  there is a broad portfolio of technologies for heat production  available from biomass, a traditional fuel source. a need for  more sustainable energy supply has led to the development  of modern biomass technologies. a high variety of new or  modernised technologies and technology combinations can  serve space and hot water needs and eventually also provide  process heat even for industrial processes.  biomass can provide a large temperature range of heat and  can be transported over long distances, which is an  advantage compared to solar thermal or geothermal heat.  however, sustainable biomass imposes limits on volume and  transport distance. another drawback of bioenergy is exhaust  emissions and the risk of greenhouse gas emissions from  energy crop cultivation.  these facts lead to two approaches to biomass development:  • towards improved, relatively small-scale, decentralized  systems for space heat and hot water.  • development of various highly efficient and upgraded biomass  cogeneration systems for industry and district heating.  small applications for space heat and hot water in buildings  in the residential sector, traditional biomass applications have  been strongly improved over the last decades for efficient and  comfortable space heating and hot water supply. the standard  application is direct combustion of solid biomass (wood), for  example in familiar but improved firewood stoves for single  rooms. for average single homes and small apartment houses,  firewood and pellet boilers are an option to provide space heat  and hot water. Wood is easy to handle, and standardized  quality and pellet systems can be automated along the whole  chain; refuelling can then be reduced to a few times a year.  automatically fed systems are more easily adaptable to  variations in heat demand, such as between summer and  winter. another advantage is lower emissions of air pollutants  from pellet appliances compared to firewood.64 pellet heating  systems are gaining importance in europe.  handfed systems are common for smaller applications below  50 kW. small applications for single rooms (around 5kW  capacity) are usually handfed wood stoves with rather low  efficiency and low cost. technologies are available for central  heating in single and semi-detached houses and are also an  option for apartment complexes. Wood boilers provide better  combustion with operating efficiencies of 70-85% and fewer  emissions than stoves with a typical sizes of 10-50 kW.65,66,67  larger wood boilers can heat large buildings such as apartment  blocks, office buildings and other large buildings in service,  commerce and industry with space heat and hot water.  direct heating technologies  large applications for district or process heat rely on  automatic feeding technologies, due to constant heat  demand at a defined temperature. direct combustion of  biomass can provide temperatures up to 1,000°c, with higher  temperatures from wood and lower temperatures from straw,  for instance. automatically fed systems are available for wood  chips, pellets, and straw. three combustion types are:68  cogeneration technologies  cogeneration increases the efficiency of using biomass, if the  provided heat can be used efficiently. the size of a plant is  limited due to the lower energy content of biomass compared  to fossil fuels and resulting difficulties in fuel logistics. selection  of the appropriate cogeneration technology depends on the  available biomass. in several scandinavian countries – with an  extraordinarily high potential of forest biomass - solid biomass  is already a main fuel for cogeneration processes. finland gets  more than 30% and sweden even 70% of its co-generated  electricity from biomass.69  direct combustion technologies  the cogeneration processes can be based on direct  combustion types (fixed bed combustion, fluidised bed  combustion, pulverised fuel combustion). While steam  engines are available from 50 kW electric steam turbines  normally cover the range above 2 mWel, with special  applications available from 0.5 mW electric. the heat is  typically generated at 60- 70% efficiency depending on the  efficiency of the power production process, which in total can  add up to 90%.70 thus, small and medium cogeneration plants  provide three to five times more heat than power, with local  heat demand often being the limiting factor for the plant size.  upgraded biomass  there are various conversion technologies available to upgrade  biomass products for the use in specific applications and for  higher temperatures. common currently available technologies  are (upgraded) biogas production and gasification. other  technologies such as pyrolysis and the production of synthetic  gases and oils are under development.  Gasification is especially valuable in the case of biomass with  low caloric value and when it includes moisture. partial  oxidation of the biomass fuel provides a combustible gas  mixture mainly consisting of carbon monoxide (co).  Gasification can provide higher efficiency along the whole  biomass chain, but at the expense of additional investments  in this more sophisticated technology. there are many  different gasification systems based on varying fuel input,  gasification technology and combination with gas turbines.  the literature shows a large cost range for gasification  cogeneration plants. assumptions on costs of the gasification  processes vary strongly.    10  other upgrading processes are biogas upgrading for exports of  natural gas network and the production of liquid biomass, such  as plant oil, ethanol or second generation fuels. those  technologies can be easily exchangeable with fossil fuels, but  the low efficiency of the overall process and energy input needed  to produce energy crops are disadvantages for sustainability.  10.6.5 biogas  biogas plants use anaerobic digestion of bacteria for the  conversion of various biomass substrates into biogas. this  gas mainly consists of methane (a gas of high caloric value),  co2, and water. anaerobic digestion can be used to upgrade  organic matter with low energy density, such as organic  waste and manure. these substrates usually contain large  water contents and appear liquid. “dry” substrates need  additional water.  liquid residues like wastes and excrements are energetically  unused. biogas taps into their calorific potential. the residue  of the digestion process is used as a fertilizer, which has  higher availability of nitrogen and is more valuable than the  input substrates.71  methane is a strong greenhouse gas, so biogas plants need  airtight covers for the digestate to maintain low emissions.72  residues and wastes are preferable for biogas compared  with energy crops such as corn silage, which require energy  and fertilizer inputs while growing and thus create  greenhouse gas emissions.  biogas plants usually consist of a digester for biogas  production and a cogeneration plant. plants vary in size and  are normally fed by a mixture of substrates for example  manure mixed with maize silage, grass silage, other energy  crops and/or organic waste.73  normally biogas is normally used in cogeneration. in Germany,  the feed-in tariff means biogas production currently is mostly  for power. the majority of biogas plants are on farms in rural  areas. small biogas plants often use the produced heat for  local space heating and process heat, such as for drying  processes. larger biogas plants need access to a heat  network to make good use of all the available heat. however,  network access is often not available in rural areas, so there is  still untapped potential of heat consumption from biogas.  monitoring of German biogas plants showed that 50% of  available heat was actually wasted.74 the conditioning and  enriching of biogas and subsequent export to the gas network  has been promoted lately and should become an option to use  biogas directly at the location of heat demand.  upgrading technologies for biomass do bear the risk  of additional methane emissions, so tight emission standards  are necessary to achieve real reductions in greenhouse  gas emissions.75  greenpeace has a very strict policy in order to use only  sustainable bioenergy in future energy systems.  guidelines for the future use of bioenergy are  documented in chapter 8  10.6.6 storage technologies  as the share of electricity provided by renewable sources  increases around the world the technologies and policies  required to handle their variability is also advancing. along with  the grid-related and forecasting solutions discussed in chapter  3, energy storage is a key part of the energy [r]evolution.  once the share of electricity from variable renewable sources  exceeds 30-35%, energy storage is necessary in order to  compensate for generation shortages or to store possible  surplus electricity generated during windy and sunny periods.  today storage technology is available for different stages of  development, scales of projects, and for meeting both shortand  long-term energy storage needs. short-term storage  technologies can compensate for output fluctuations that last  only a few hours, whereas longer term or seasonal storage  technologies can bridge the gap over several weeks.  short-term options include batteries, flywheels, compressed  air power plants and pump storage power stations with high  efficiency factors. the later is also used for long term storage.  perhaps the most promising of these options is electric  vehicles (evs) with vehicle-to-Grid (v2G) capability, which can  increase flexibility of the power system by charging when  there is surplus renewable generation and discharging while  parked to take up peaking capacity or ancillary services to the  power system. vehicles are often parked close to main load  centres during peak times (e.g., outside factories) so there  would be no network issues. however battery costs are  currently very high and significant logistical challenges remain.  seasonal storage technologies include hydro pumped  storage and the production of hydrogen or renewable  methane. While the latter two options are currently in the  development with several demonstration projects mainly in  Germany, pumped storage has been in use around the world  for more than a century.  pumped storage  pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of grid energy  storage now available and currently the most important  technology to manage high shares of wind and solar electricity.  it is a type of hydroelectric power generation that stores energy  by pumping water from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher  elevation during times of low-cost, off-peak electricity and  releasing it through turbines during high demand periods.  While pumped storage is currently the most cost-effective  means of storing large amounts of electrical energy on an  operating basis, capital costs and appropriate geography are  critical decision factors in building new infrastructure. losses  associated with the pumping and water storage process make  such plants net consumers of energy; accounting for  evaporation and conversion losses, approximately 70-85% of  the electrical energy used to pump water into the elevated  reservoir can be recaptured when it is released.  renewable methane  both gas plants and cogeneration units can be converted to  operate on renewable methane, which can be made from  renewable electricity and used to effectively store energy  from the sun and wind. renewable methane can be stored  and transported via existing natural gas infrastructure, and  can supply electricity when needed. Gas storage capacities  can close electricity supply gaps of up to two months, and  the smart link between power grid and gas network can allow  for grid stabilisation. expanding local heat networks, in  connection with power grids or gas networks, would enable  the electricity stored as methane to be used in cogeneration  units with high overall efficiency factors, providing both heat  and power.76 there are currently several pilot projects in  Germany in the range of one to two- megawatt size, but not  in a larger commercial scale yet. if those pilot projects are  successful, a commercial scale can be expected between  2015 and 2020. however, policy support, to encourage the  commercialisation of storage is still lacking.    figure 10.33 | overview storage capacity of  different energy storage systems  source fraunhofer institut, 2010.  figure 10.34 | renewable (power) (to) methane -  renewable gas storing renewable power as renewable as  natural gas by linking electricity and natural gas networks  battery storage  there are numerous battery technologies on the market and  the increasing demand for electric vehicles triggered the  battery development significantly of the past decade. the  latest announcement of the us american company tesla to  build up a large scale battery manufaction plant will most  likely result in increased competition among the battery  industry and reduced prices.  especially lithium batteries are currently under discussion and  a new generation of large scale lithium-metal and lithiumion-  batteries (lib) as well as small scale application such as  tesla’s “powerWall” will increasingly complement renewable  power generation. besides that, mobile energy storage  devices form the basis not only for future oriented drive  systems such as vehicles with hybrid drive and all electrically  driven vehicles but also hydrogen storage and fuel cell  technologies. battery systems like lithium-sulfur and lithiumair  have a great potential to reach the highest capacity and  energy density values (dlr-Wagner).77 in order to increase  battery safety, reliability and to reduce costs partly through  economies of scale, battery research and development  activities have significantly expanded worldwide. many  energy experts see new battery technology in combination  with low cost solar photovoltaic power generation as a  potential disruptive technology which can change future  energy markets dramatically.  storage technologies – the cascade approach  there is no “one-size-fits-all” technology for storage. along  the entire supply and demand chain, different storage  technologies are required to cover the exact needs in regard  to storage time – from second reserve for frequency stability  to seasonal storage of several months. a cascade of different  storage technologies is required to support the local  integration of power generation from variable renewable  energy (vre) in distribution networks, support the grid  infrastructure to balance vre power generation, and support  self-generation and self-consumption of vre by customers.  figure 30 shows a whole range of storage technologies.  269    e n e r gy e f f i c i e n cy – m o r e w i t h l e s s  image the dark squares that make up the checkerboard pattern in this image are fields of a sort—fields of seaweed. along the south coast of south korea, seaweed is often  grown on ropes, which are held near the surface with buoys. this technique ensures that the seaweed stays close enough to the surface to get enough light during high tide but  doesn’t scrape against the bottom during low tide.  methodology for the energy  demand projections  energy consumption  in the year 2012  reference demand scenario  efficiency measures and  potentials  efficiency pathways of the  energy [r]evolution  development of energy  intensities  smart use  of renewable  energy makes  economic sense”  “    using energy efficiently is cheaper than producing new  energy from scratch and often has many other benefits. an  efficient clothes washing machine or dishwasher, for  example, uses less power and saves water too. efficiency in  buildings doesn’t mean going without – it should provide a  higher level of comfort. for example, a well-insulated house  will feel warmer in the winter, cooler in the summer and be  healthier to live in. an efficient refrigerator is quieter, has no  frost inside or condensation outside, and will probably last  longer. efficient lighting offers more light where you need it.  efficiency is thus really better described as ‘more with less’.  there are very simple steps every to efficiency both at home  in business and industries, through updating or replacing  separate systems or appliances, that will save both money  and energy. but the biggest savings don’t come from  incremental steps but from rethinking the whole concept -  ‘the whole house’, ‘the whole car’ or even ‘the whole  transport system’. in this way, energy needs can often be cut  back by four to ten times.  in order to find out the global and regional energy efficiency  potential, the dutch institute ecofys developed energy  demand scenarios for the Greenpeace energy [r]evolution  analysis in 2008, which have been updated by the university  of utrecht for the 2012 scenario edition (Graus et al. 2012).1  for the 2015 edition, the German aerospace center (dlr)  further developed and specified the energy demand  pathways for the power, heating, industry, transport and  other sectors via energy intensity indicators for all regions.  these scenarios cover energy demand over the period 2012-  2050 for ten world regions. in contrast to a reference  scenario, based on the iea World energy outlook 2014 (iea  Weo 2014)2, a low energy demand scenario for energy  efficiency improvements has been defined taking into  account historic trends, estimated technical efficiency  potentials and regional differences. the efficiency scenario is  based on the best technical energy efficiency potentials  taking into account implementation constraints including  costs and other barriers. the resulting demand structures of  the updated energy [r]evolution scenarios are summarised  below. this chapter focuses on stationary sectors and  processes, information about efficiency measures,  technologies and demand scenarios for the transportation  sector can be found in chapter 12.  11.1 methodology for the energy demand  projections  11.1.1 step 1: definition of a reference demand  scenario  in order to estimate potentials for energy-efficiency  improvement in 2050 a detailed reference scenario is  required that projects the development of energy demand  when current trends continue. in the World energy outlook  2014 “current policies” scenario (iea Weo 2014) only  currently adopted energy and climate change policies are  implemented. technological change including efficiency  improvement is slow but substantial and mainly triggered by  increased energy prices. the reference scenario covers  energy demand development in the period 2012-2050 for ten  world regions and three sectors:  • transport  • industry  • other (also referred to as “buildings and agriculture”).  Within the industry and other sectors a distinction is made  between electricity demand and fuel and heat demand. heat  demand mainly consists of district heating from heat plants  and from combined heat and power plants. fuel and heat  demand is referred to as ‘fuel demand’ for in the figures that  follow. the energy demand scenarios focus only on energy-related  fuel, power and heat use. feedstock consumption in  industries is thus excluded from the analysis. total final  consumption data in Weo includes non-energy use. by  assuming that the share of non-energy use remains the same  as in the base year 2012, we determine the energy-related  fuel use beyond 2012.  11.1.2 step 2: development of low energy demand  scenarios  the low energy demand scenarios are based on literature  studies and new calculations. the scenarios take into  account:  • the implementation of best practice technologies and a  certain share of emerging technologies.  • no behavioral changes or loss in comfort levels.  • no structural changes in the economy, other than occurring  in the reference scenario.  • equipment and installations are replaced at the end of their  (economic) lifetime, so no early retirement.  the development pathways are based on the current  worldwide energy use per sector and subsector and the  development of energy intensities in recent years, according  to the Weo scenarios and under the assumption of technical  potentials according to (Graus et al. 2012). furthermore, the  low energy demand scenarios aim for a convergence of references    energy consumption pattern in the different world regions  consistent to the convergence of economic development  assumed in the scenarios. figure 11.1 shows a breakdown of  final energy demand in the world by the most important subsectors  in the base year 2012.  efficiency measures and potentials in the transport sector  were described by the dlr institute of vehicle concepts in  2012 and updated and expanded in 2014 in commission of  Greenpeace (dlr 2015).3 the results are used as a basis for  developing the energy [r]evolution scenarios and  documented in chapter 12.  11.2 energy consumption in the year 2012  the following figures provide a short overview on the energy  consumption pattern worldwide and per world regions in  2012 as provided by the iea energy balances of 2014.4  figure 11.1 shows the final energy consumption worldwide  distinguished by energy carriers and sub-sectors.  Worldwide, industry consumes about 33% of total final  energy demand on average in 2012 (excluding non-energy  use). the share in africa is lowest with 16%, the share in  china is highest with 52%. energy consumption in the  residential sector (included in other sectors) add up to 25%  of total final energy consumption worldwide.  figure 11.2 shows a breakdown of final energy demand by  sub sector in industry worldwide for the base year 2012.  the largest energy consuming sectors in industry are  chemical and petrochemical industry, iron and steel and nonmetallic  minerals. together the sectors consume about 45%  of industrial energy demand. since these three sectors are  relatively large we look at them in detail. also we look at  aluminium production in detail, which is in the category of  non-ferrous metals because the share of aluminium  production makes up more than 10% of total industrial  energy demand in 2012 (iea-Weo 2014). for all sectors, we  look at implementing best practice technologies, increased  recycling and increased material efficiency. Where possible,  the potentials are based on specific energy consumption data  in physical units (mj/tonne steel, mj/tonne aluminium etc.).  272    energy consumed in buildings and agriculture (summarized  as other sectors) represents 40% of global energy  consumption in 2012. in most regions, the share of  residential energy demand is larger than the share of  commercial and public services energy demand (except in  oecd asia oceania). since energy use in agriculture is  relatively small (globally less than 5% of total final energy  demand), we do not look at this sector in detail but assume  the same energy saving potentials as in residential and  commercial combined.  fuels and heat use represent the largest share of total final  energy use in this sector, see figure 11.4. the share ranges  from 51% for oecd north america to 95% for africa.  the residential sector has the largest end-use for fuels and  heat, see figure 11.5: its share ranges from 44% in oecd  asia oceania to 91% in africa.    While residential buildings use a bigger share of fuel and heat,  for electricity, the consumption is more evenly spread over  the subsector of “commerce and public services” and  residential. Globally, 48% of electricity is used in residential  buildings and 40% in commerce and public services (also  referred to as services). the use of electricity in the services  sector strongly depends on the region and ranges from 16%  in india to 55% in oecd asia oceania, see figure 11.6.  the breakdown of electricity use per type of appliance is  different per region. in the energy [r]evolution scenario, a  convergence is assumed for the different types of electricity  demand per region in 2050. based on data in the literature5,  the following breakdown of electricity use per type is used as  default if no specific regional information is available:  • space heating 10%  • hot water 10%  • lighting 20%  • ict and home entertainment (he) 12%  • other appliances 30%  • air conditioning 18%  the trend is moving in the wrong direction: energy demand  continues to grow for appliances, lighting, and a large array  of electrical and fossil fuel-powered equipment, despite  significant progress on labelling and mandatory minimum  energy performance standards (meps). market penetration of  major appliances has increased significantly in emerging  markets, and plug loads from electrical devices and network  usage continue to grow in all markets, resulting in energy  consumption growth of over 50% from 2000 to 2012 (iea  etp 2015).  11.3 reference demand scenario  figure 11.7 shows the reference scenario for final energy  demand for the world per sector derived from the iea Weo 2014.  Worldwide final energy demand is expected to grow by 65%,  from 327 exajoule (ej) in 2012 to more than 538 ej in 2050.  the electricity demand has the largest relative growth of  120% in industry and 130% in other sectors. fuel demand in  other sectors is expected to grow slowest from 92 ej in  2012 to 116 ej in 2050.    in the reference scenario, final energy demand in 2050 will  be largest in china (112 ej), followed by oecd north  america (82 ej) and india (61 ej). final energy demand in  oecd asia oceania, middle east and latin america will be  lowest (21 ej and 36 ej respectively).  figure 11.9 shows the development of final energy demand  per capita per region in the reference scenario.  there would still be large differences between regions for final  energy demand per capita in 2050 in the reference scenario.  energy demand per capita is expected to be highest in oecd  north america and eastern europe/eurasia (135 and 132  Gj/capita respectively), followed by oecd asia oceania and  middle east (104 and 103 Gj/capita respectively). final energy  demand in africa, india, other non-oecd asia, and latin america  is expected to be lowest, ranging from 19-58 Gj/capita.  figure 11.10 gives the reference scenario for final energy  demand in industries in the period 2012-2050.  as can be seen, the energy demand in chinese industries is  expected to be huge in 2050 and amount to 54 ej. the  energy demand in all other regions together is expected to be  133 ej, meaning that china accounts for 29% of worldwide  energy demand in industries in 2050.    source iea Weo 2014 / dlr calculations for reference case.  in the reference scenario, energy demand in buildings and  agriculture is forecast to grow considerably (see figure 11.11).  figure 11.11 shows that energy demand in buildings and  agriculture in 2050 is highest in oecd north america (33 ej),  followed by china (32 ej) and oecd europe (29 ej). oecd asia  oceania, latin america and middle east have the lowest energy  demand for buildings and agriculture, ranging from 9-11 Gj.  the share of fuel and electricity use by buildings and  agriculture in total energy demand in 2012 and 2050 are  shown in figure 11.12. india and africa have the highest  share of buildings and agriculture in total final energy demand  today. until 2050, a sharp decrease is expected in india.  Globally, it is expected that electricity use in this sector will be  bigger in 2050 than in 2012 (16% instead of 12%) and fuel  use will be smaller (22% instead of 28%).    11.4 efficiency measures and potentials  11.4.1 efficiency measures in industry  the overall technical efficiency potentials are estimated after  identifying the most significant energy-efficiency improvements.  in the reference scenario, some of these energy-efficiency  improvements have already been implemented (autonomous  and policy induced energy-efficiency improvement). this  baseline was complemented by a most efficient development  pathway assuming all known and characterized efficiency  measures in the industry sector as being implemented.  the benchmarking of the industry sector’s energy use can  provide valuable insights regarding energy efficiency  potentials. energy efficiency indicators (eeis) differ  significantly between countries and sectors as a result of  differences in resource availability, energy prices, plant size,  and the age of capital stock, local factors, capital costs,  awareness, opportunity costs and government policies.  international energy statistics, which are the basis of the eei  approach, are subject to uncertainties however.  international benchmark studies show large differences for  energy intensity on a country level for the iron and steel,  chemical and pulp and paper industry. large energy savings  potentials were found in the range of 20-30% on average. this  section documents a special survey about industry efficiency  potential commissioned by Greenpeace international in 2013  (uni utrecht 2013).6 unfortunately, there are only very few  publications about energy efficiency potentials for various  subsectors of the global industry. thus, consistent data is  sometimes up to 10 years old, and there is a need for more indepth  research. even the Global energy assessment report –  published in 2012 – refers to data from 2007 and 2005.  iron and steel  most sectors in manufacturing industry produce a range of  products, so it is generally not possible to apply a simple  indicator of energy efficiency in energy use per tonne of  product. instead, an aggregate indicator, the energy  efficiency index (eei) is used. a decrease of the eei means  that the energy use per unit of product was reduced.  figure 11.13 shows the development of the energy efficiency  index for the iron and steel industry for G8+5 countries. for all  countries together, the energy efficiency improvement  amounted to 9 % between 2000 and 2005 (1.8 per cent per  year). it is striking that in some countries (such as south africa),  energy efficiency deteriorated, which may be caused by the  strong increase in steel demand, leading companies to take  less efficient plants into operation again. also remarkable is the  strong progress in energy efficiency in china (7.4%/a) and india  (7.9%/a), most likely through the rapid expansion of production  capacity with relatively efficient technology (reeep, 2008).7  references    figure 11.13 indicates that iron and steel plants in japan are  most efficient, followed by plants in Germany. among the  included eu countries, the eeis for the uk and italy are  relatively high and imply high overall energy efficiency  improvement potentials in the range of 35-45% on average.  significant differences exist in energy efficiency and co2  emission intensity of steel production among countries and  production plants. these differences can, partly, be explained  by variations in the quality of the resources and the cost of  energy (iea, 2008a).8 low energy efficiencies in some  countries reflect traditionally very low energy prices and  decreasing production volumes. however, in many countries  production has increased in recent years and energy prices  have risen substantially, already resulting in energy efficiency  improvements (iea, 2008a). furthermore, factors such as  good housekeeping, process control and level of waste heat  recovery may also explain the differences in energy and co2  emission intensity.  chemicals  table 11.1 shows an energy efficiency index of chemical  industry on country level. note that the eei is inverted in  comparison to the eei for the iron and steel industry, here a  higher eei means higher energy efficiency. the eei implies a  global average energy savings potential in the chemical  industry of 18% by implementing best practice technology.  values range from 0.7 for the us to 0.94 for italy. Generally a  determining factor in the energy efficiency index is the age of  plants, where older plants are less efficient than newer plants.  however, retrofits can invalidate this rule of thumb. a global  analysis indicates that chemical plants built in the 1970s are  the least efficient. the 1950 – 60s production plants had a  significant amount of upgrading, especially after the 1973 oil  price crisis, and show relatively good performance (iea, 2007).  due to the high diversity in terms of products produced in the  chemical industry it is worthwhile to look into energy  efficiency indicators for different products; such as the  following example of energy efficiency potential for the  production of ammonia.  ammonia production  the specific energy use for ammonia production (including  feed stocks) for G8+5 is given in figure 11.14. G8 countries  for which data are available show a slow decline in specific  energy use in 2005 in comparison to 1995. the average  progress (weighted according to production volumes) is 15 %  over the period from 1995-2005 (1.7 % per year). also, in this  case progress in developing countries (brazil and india) is  much faster. the specific energy consumption in china is  highest and reveals a large efficiency improvement potential.    pulp and paper industry  table 11.2 shows an energy efficiency index (eei) for the pulp  and paper industry for a selection of countries. the eei is  based on best practice values for pulp and paper production  and actual energy use in countries for pulp and paper  production (both in Gj/ton). an eei of 1.4 means that energy  use of pulp and paper production is 40% above best  practice, so this implies a savings potential by implementing  best practice technology of 40% in comparison to current  energy use.  based on the eei in table 11.2 japan and south korea are  most efficient in terms of pulp and paper production, whereas  the us and canada have the lowest energy efficiency. over  the last decade, the south korean paper industry has  invested heavily in relatively efficient capacity expansion (iea,  2007).9 canada’s comparatively low energy efficiency, on the  other hand, may be attributed to a high level of energy use in  older newsprint mills. also cheap hydroelectric power and the  use of wood waste with low efficiency could explain the low  eei in canada (iea, 2007).  energy efficiency improvement potentials and barriers  the largest potential for energy efficiency improvement can  be found when replacing older plants by new capacity. the  long term potential is at least 20-30% (on average), based on  implementing Best Available Techniques (bat), and can  increase in the future by emerging technologies that become  available. in general, high energy efficiency improvement  rates in industry require timely retirement of old/less efficient  capacity. retrofitting a 30-year-old plant so it can last another  20 years is disadvantageous from an energy efficiency point  of view because the largest improvement potential is  available when building new capacity, where plants can be  completely redesigned.  many studies show negative costs for most energy efficiency  measures in industry, meaning that the payback time of  measures is below their lifetime. it should be noted though  that not all steps taken are necessarily profitable from a  company’s perspective although most measures payback  within their lifetime. investment criteria in terms of desired  payback times, restrictions to the height of up-front capital  costs and opportunity costs in the end determine the  attractiveness of measures. furthermore, companies can be  very hesitant to implement measures that might (temporarily)  reduce plant reliability. the most important barriers that can  prevent energy efficiency and emission reduction measures  from being implemented and inhibit investment in  technologies that are both energy efficient and economically  efficient include:  • capital goods have not yet been fully depreciated;  • the lack of access to capital for investments in energy  efficiency measures and emission reduction measures;  • investments in other projects within the company are  considered more important or more efficient.  literature provides ample empirical evidence for the  existence of such barriers in the industry sector.  11.4.2 efficiency measures in buildings  a summary of possible energy saving measures for each of  the three types of fuel/heat use is provided here.  space heating  Globally, buildings accounted for 32% (118.6 ej) of final  energy consumption in 2012 and 53% of global electricity  consumption (iea etp 2015).10 energy-efficiency  improvement for space heating is indicated by the energy  demand per m2 floor area per heating degree day (hdd).  heating degree day is the number of degrees that a day’s  average temperature is below 18o celsius. typical current  heating demand for dwellings in oecd countries is 70-120  kj/m2/hdd (based on iea, 2007), but those with better  efficiency consume below 32 kj/m2/hdd.11 the european    union, which has made the most progress compared to other  regions, requires member countries to include cost optimality  as a criterion when developing building codes. france, for  example, has enacted a building code that limits space  heating, water heating, cooling and lighting energy to 50  kWh/m2 or less (iea etp 2015).  an example of a household with low energy use is given in  figure 11.15.  technologies to reduce energy demand of new dwellings are :12  • triple-glazed windows with low-emittance coatings. these  windows reduce heat loss to 40% compared to windows with  one pane. the low-emittance coating prevents energy waves  in sunlight coming in and thereby reduces cooling need.  • insulation of roofs, walls, floors and basement. proper  insulation reduces heating and cooling demand by 50% in  comparison to average energy demand.  • passive solar energy. Good building design can make use  of solar energy design, through orientation of the building’s  site and windows. the term “passive” indicates that no  mechanical equipment is used, because solar gains are  brought in through windows and shading keeps the heat  out in summer.  • balanced ventilation with heat recovery. heated indoor air  passes to a heat recovery unit and is used to heat incoming  outdoor air.    for existing buildings, retrofits help reduce energy use.  important retrofit options are more efficient windows and  insulation, which can save 39% and 32% of space heating or  cooling demand, respectively, according to the international  energy agency (iea 2006). furthermore, the iea reports that  average energy consumption in current buildings in europe can  decrease overall by more than 50%. in 2015, the iea  reconfirmed that energy use by space heating, cooling and  lighting, which represents 38% of global buildings energy  consumption, could be reduced by more than half by ensuring  that building envelopes are energy efficient (iea etp 2015).  While the technologies are there, the political process is far too  slow to exploit these large cost effective efficiency potentials.  to improve the efficiency of existing heating systems, an  option is to install new thermostatic valves, which can save  15% of energy required for heating. on average, this option is  installed in an estimated 40% of systems in europe.13  effective air sealing can reduce heating and cooling energy by  20% to 30% and needs to be implemented as part of any  construction and renovation project. more effort is needed  globally to ensure that any building that will be heated or  cooled is properly sealed. When sealing is done correctly,  with controlled ventilation and advanced heat recovery, it can  improve indoor air quality (iea etp 2015).  besides reducing the demand for heating, another option is  to improve the conversion of efficiency of heat supply. a  number of options are available, such as high efficiency  boilers that can achieve efficiencies of 107%, based on lower  heating value. another option is the use of heat pumps.  hot water and cooking  energy savings options for hot water include pipe insulation  and high efficiency boilers. another option is heat recovery  units that capture the waste heat from water going down the  drain and use it to preheat cold water before it enters the  household water heater. a heat recovery system can recover  as much as 70% of this heat and recycle it back for  immediate use.14 furthermore, water-saving shower heads  and flow inhibitors can be implemented. the typical saving  rate (in terms of energy) for shower heads is 12.5% and 25%  for flow inhibitors.15 in developing regions, improved cook  stoves can be an important energy-efficiency option, which  consume less energy than conventional ones.16  electricity use  electricity savings options per application are discussed in  the following.  electricity for space heating and hot water  measures to reduce electricity use for space heating and hot  water are similar to measures for heating by fuels. changing  the building shell can reduce the need for heat, and the other  approach is to improve the conversion efficiency of heat  supply, for example with heat pumps to provide both cooling  and space and water heating, as discussed in chapter 10  (renewable heating and cooling technologies). typically,  heat pumps can produce from 2.5 to 4 times as much useful  heat as the amount of high-grade energy input, with  variations due to seasonal performance. the sales of heat  pumps in a number of major european markets experienced  strong growth in recent years. total annual sales in austria,  finland, france, Germany, italy, norway, sweden and  switzerland reached 636,000 in 2013, compared to 446,000  in 2005.17 data suggests that heat pumps may be beginning  to achieve a critical mass for space and water heating in a  number of european countries.  lighting  incandescent bulbs have been the most common lamps for a  more than 100 years but also the most inefficient type since  up to 95% of the electricity is lost as heat.18 incandescent  lamps have a relatively short life-span (average approximately  1,000 hours) but have a low initial cost and attractive light  colour. compact fluorescent light bulbs (cfls) are more  expensive than incandescent, but they use about a quarter of  the energy and last about 10 times longer.19 in recent years,  many policies have been implemented that reduce or ban the  use of incandescent light bulbs in various countries.  however, energy savings from lighting are not just a question  of using more efficient lamps but also involve other  approaches: reducing light absorption of luminaries (the  fixture in which the lamp is housed), optimizing lighting levels  (which commonly exceed values recommended by iea  (2006)), using automatic controls like movement and daylight  sensors, and retrofitting buildings to make better use of  daylight. buildings designed to optimize daylight can receive  up to 70% of their annual illumination needs from daylight,  while a typical building will only get 20 to 25%.  the light-emitting diode (led) is one of today’s most energy-efficient  and rapidly-developing lighting technologies. led is a  highly energy efficient lighting technology and has the potential  to fundamentally change the future of lighting. residential  leds use at least 75% less energy, and last 25 times longer  than incandescent lighting.20    ict and home entertainment equipment  information and communication technologies (ict) and home  entertainment consist of a growing number of appliances in  both residential and commercial buildings, such as  computers, (smart) phones, televisions, set-top boxes,  games consoles, printers, copiers and servers. ict and  consumer electronics account for about 15% of residential  electricity consumption now.21 Globally, a tripling is expected  for ict and consumer electronics from 776 tWh/a in 2010 to  1,700 tWh/a in 2030. one of the main options for reducing  energy use in ict and home entertainment is using best  available technology. iea (2009b) estimates that a reduction  is possible from 1,700 tWh/a to 775 tWh/a in 2030 by  applying best available technology and to 1,220 tWh/a by  least life-cycle costs measures, which do not impose  additional costs on consumers. below, we discuss other  energy savings options for ict and home entertainment.  other appliances  other appliances include cold appliances (freezers and  refrigerators), washing machines, dryers, dish washers,  ovens and other kitchen equipment. electricity use for cold  appliances depends on average per household storage  capacities, the ratio of frozen to fresh food storage capacity,  ambient temperatures and humidity, and food storage  temperatures and control (iea, 2003). european and  japanese households typically have one combined  refrigerator-freezer in the kitchen or they have a refrigerator  and a separate freezer. in oecd north america and australia,  where homes are larger, almost all households have a  refrigerator-freezer, and many also have a separate freezer  and occasionally a second refrigerator.22 it is estimated that  by improving the energy efficiency of cold appliances, on  average 45% of electricity use could be saved for eu-27.23  for “wet appliances,” an estimated potential of 40-60% could  be saved by implementing best practice technology.  air conditioning  there are several options for technological savings from air  conditioning equipment; one is using a different refrigerant.  tests with the refrigerant ikon b show possible energy  consumption reductions of 20-25% compared to refrigerants  commonly used.24  Geothermal cooling is another important option explained in  chapter 10. of several technical concepts available, the  highest energy savings can be achieved with two storage  reservoirs in aquifers where cold water is used from the cold  reservoir in summer. the hot reservoir can be used with a  heat pump for heating in winter.  solar energy can also be used for heating and cooling; the  different types are also discussed in chapter 10 renewable  heating and cooling. heat pumps and air conditioners that  can be powered by solar photovoltaic systems,25 for example,  use only 0.05 kW electric power instead of 0.35 kW for  regular air conditioning.26  in addition to efficient air conditioning equipment, it is as  important to reduce the need for air conditioning. insulation  can be used to prevent heat from entering the building along  with fewer inefficient appliances in the house (such as  incandescent lamps, old refrigerators, etc.) that give off heat,  cool exterior finishes (such as cool roof technology27 and  light-coloured paint on the walls) to reduce the peak cooling  demand as much as 10-15%28, better windows, vegetation to  reduce the amount of heat that comes into the house, and  ventilation instead of air conditioning units.    11.5 efficiency pathways of the energy  [r]evolution  11.5.1 low demand scenario for industry sector  figure 11.16 shows the resulting energy demand scenarios  for the sector industry on a global level. energy demand in  electricity can be reduced by 23% and nearly 60% for fuel  use, in comparison to the reference scenario in 2050. in  comparison to 2012, global fuel use in industry decreases  from 78 ej to 50 ej and electricity use shows an increase  from 29 ej to 48 ej which is also a result of the substitution  of fuel use for heating with electric heating systems.  figure 11.17 shows the final energy demand in the industrial  sector per region for total energy demand. large reductions are  assumed in all regions, especially in the developing countries.  11.5.2 low demand scenario for buildings and other  sectors  figure 11.18 shows the resulting energy demand scenarios  for the buildings and agriculture sector on a global level.  energy demand for electricity is reduced by 33% and for fuel  by 46%, in comparison to the reference scenario in 2050. in  comparison to 2012, global fuel use in this sector decreases  from 92 ej to 62 ej while electricity use shows a strong  increase from 38 ej to 58 ej.  energy    figure 11.19 shows the final energy demand in the buildings  and agriculture (= other sectors) per region for total final  energy demand. decreases in absolute terms are strongest in  the oecd regions while in most developing countries  population will further grow and the use of electronic and  other devices will further proliferate.  11.6 development of energy intensities  resulting specific energy consumption in transport,  industry and other sectors are shown in figure 11.20 to  figure 11.22 in terms of global averages and in figure 11.23  for each world region as total final energy demand of all  sectors. energy intensity in transport and industry  decreases significantly already in the reference scenario  while in the energy [r]evolution scenario an even stronger  decoupling of economic growth and energy consumption is  assumed. specific electricity demand in other sectors  increases only slightly from 5.6 to 6.1 Gj per capita (1,550  kWh/capita to 1,690 kWh/capita) while specific fuel demand  decreases strongly due to the implementation of ambitious  efficiency measures for heating in the energy [r]evolution.  the resulting energy intensities for different world regions  show a convergence until 2050 but still large differences  between developed and developing countries which are a  result of the economic and population growth assumptions,  assumed developments in the reference scenario according  to Weo 2014 and the assumption that available efficiency  potentials are implemented in all world regions. different  assumptions for economic growth and their consequences  for lifestyle are possible especially for africa, india and other  asia and may lead to significant higher demand pathways  and therefore higher infrastructural needs for a secure  energy supply. further research is needed here in order to  take into account different societal and economic pathways  and how these could affect energy demand in different  world regions. on the other side an even larger deployment  of potentials for renewable energies is possible in most  regions and can ensure that requirements for an additional  energy supply can be met.  284      t r a n s p o r t  image late spring and summer weather brings blooms of color to the atlantic ocean off of south america, at least from a satellite view. the patagonian shelf break is a  biologically rich patch of ocean where airborne dust from the land, iron-rich currents from the south, and upwelling currents from the depths provide a bounty of nutrients for  the grass of the sea—phytoplankton. in turn, those floating sunlight harvesters become food for some of the richest fisheries in the world.  the future of the transport  sector in the reference  scenario  technical and behavioural  measures to reduce transport  energy consumption  projection of the  future car market  conclusion  the transport  revolution  must start in  megacities.”  “  sustainable transport is needed to reduce the level of  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, just as much as a shift  to renewable electricity and heat production. today, the  transport sector requires just over one fourth (27%) (iea Weo  sr 2015)1 of current energy use, including road and rail,  aviation and sea transport. by the end of 2013, 92.7% of all  transport energy demand was provided by oil products, 2.5%  from bio fuels and only 1% from electricity (iea Weo sr  2015). a transition from fossil fuels to renewable electricity –  either directly or via synthetic fuels – for the entire global  transport sector is required in order to phase-out carbon  emissions. this is one of the most difficult parts of the energy  [r]evolution and requires a true technical revolution. it is  ambitious but nevertheless possible with currently available  technologies for land-based and other transport.  14% of all fossil transport fuels are used for “bunker fuel,”  meaning transport energy for international shipping and  international air transport. in order to replace bunker fuels  entirely with renewables, a combination of energy efficiency  and renewable fuels is required. both the marine and aviation  sector can start this transition, but we need more research  and development along the way towards a truly 100%  renewable system. biofuels and synthetic hydrocarbons  (synfuels) – produced with renewable electricity – are the only  realistic renewable energy option for planes currently and for  the next decade. for ships, new wind-based drives, such as  new generation sails and flettner rotors, are needed to  replace a proportion of engine fuels.  the transport [r]evolution however must start in (mega)cities  where a modular shift from individual to efficient and  convenient public transport systems powered by renewable  electricity is possible in a short time frame and with currently  available technologies. political action is the main barrier in  changing land-based transport systems.  in order to assess the present status and potential  technological pathways of global transport, including its  carbon footprint, a special study about technical efficiency  potentials and the effect of modular shifts in the transport  sector was undertaken for the 2012 energy [r]evolution  report by the German aerospace center’s (dlr) institute of  vehicle concepts (dlr 2012)2 analyzing the entire global  transport sector based on the ten iea world regions. the  institute carried out new technical research for Greenpeace in  early 2015, focusing on the latest developments of landbased  transport systems, especially for megacities (dlr  2015).3 the resulting key parameters of this study are shown  in table 12.7.  the demand projections for both energy [r]evolution  scenarios are based on the afore-mentioned research work.  the scenario base year has been updated using the 2014 iea  energy balances. the projections of the transport sector in  the reference scenario are based on iea Weo 2014.  assumed parameters for person and freight kilometres,  occupancy rates and vehicle market development have not  been re-calculated but adapted to the new base year 2012 as  opposed to 2009 in the previous report.  the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario starts with the  same technical and modal shift pathways but introduces  them more quickly and to a larger extent. in addition, the  advanced scenario replaces almost the entire remaining fossil  fuel demand with synfuels, hydrogen and renewable methane  produced from renewables from 2035 onwards. thus, the  electricity demand in the advanced energy [r]evolution is  significantly higher.  this chapter provides an overview of selected measures  appropriate to develop a more energy efficient and  sustainable transport system in the future, with a focus on:  • reducing transport demand,  • shifting transport ‘modes’ (from high to low energy  intensity), and  • improving energy efficiency from technology development.  the section provides plausible transport energy demand  calculations including projections for the passenger vehicle  market (light duty vehicles) used as background knowledge  for the updated energy [r]evolution transport pathways.  overall, some technologies will have to be adapted for  greater energy efficiency. in other situations, a simple  modification will not be enough. the transport of people in  megacities and urban areas will have to be reorganised  almost entirely and individual transport must be  complemented or even substituted by public transport  systems. car sharing and public transport on demand are  only the beginning of the transition needed for a system that  carries more people more quickly and conveniently to their  destination while using less energy.    12.1 the future of the transport sector in the  reference scenario  as for electricity projections, a detailed reference scenario is  required for transport. the scenario constructed includes  detailed market shares and energy intensity data per mode of  transport and per region up to 2050 (sources: Wbscd, eu  studies). based on the reference scenario, deviating  transport performance and technical parameters are applied  to create both energy[r]evolution scenarios for reducing  energy consumption. traffic performance is assumed to  decline for the high energy intensity modes and further  energy reduction potentials were assumed from further  efficiency gains, alternative power trains and fuels. the  advanced energy [r]evolution introduces electric mobility  faster and replaces all remaining fossil fuels between 2040  and 2050 with renewable synfuels, especially in the marine  and aviation transport sectors.  the total transport energy demand is made up of light duty  vehicles (ldvs), heavy and medium duty freight trucks, rail,  air, and national marine transport (inland navigation).  although energy use from international marine bunkers  (international shipping fuel suppliers) is not included in these  calculations, it is still estimated to account for 14% of today’s  worldwide transport final energy demand and around 15% by  2050 in the reference scenario. a un report concluded that  carbon dioxide emissions from shipping are much greater  than initially thought and increasing at an alarming rate  (eyring et al 2005).4 it is therefore very important to improve  the energy efficiency of international shipping. possible  options are examined later in this chapter.  the definitions of the transport modes for the scenarios are:  (fulton 2004)5  • light duty vehicles (ldv) are four-wheel vehicles used  primarily for personal passenger road travel. these are  typically cars, sports utility vehicles (suvs), small  passenger vans (up to eight seats) and personal pickup  trucks. light duty vehicles are also simply called ‘cars’  within this chapter.  • heavy duty vehicles (hdv) are long-haul trucks operating  almost exclusively on diesel fuel. these trucks carry large  loads with lower energy intensity (energy use per tonne-kilometre  of haulage) than medium duty vehicles, such as  delivery trucks.  • medium duty vehicles (mdv) include medium-haul trucks  and delivery vehicles.  • aviation in each region denotes domestic air travel  (intraregional and international air travel is provided as  one figure).  • inland navigation denotes freight shipping with vessels  operating on rivers and canals or in coastal areas for  domestic transport purposes  figure 12.1 shows the breakdown of worldwide final energy  demand for the transport modes in 2012 and 2050 in the  reference scenario. the largest share of energy demand  comes from ldv (mainly for passenger road transport),  although it decreases from 71% in 2012 to 68% in 2050. the  share of domestic air transport increases from 4.6% to 5.1%.  of particular note is the high share of road transport in total  transport energy demand: 87% in 2012 and 82% in 2050.  overall energy demand in the transport sector adds up to 90  ej in 2012. it is projected in the reference scenario to  increase to 150 ej in 2050.    in the advanced energy [r]evolution scenario, implying the  implementation of all efficiency and behavioural measures  described, we calculated in fact a decrease of energy  demand to 70 ej, which means a lower annual energy  consumption than in 2012.  figure 12.2 shows world final energy use for the transport  sector per region in 2012 and 2050 in the reference  scenario. today, energy consumption is comprised by nearly  half of the total amount by oecd north america and oecd  europe. in 2050, the picture looks more fragmented. in  particular, china and india form a much bigger portion of the  world transport energy demand, whereas oecd north  america remains the largest energy consumer.  12.2 technical and behavioural measures to  reduce transport energy consumption  the following section first describes how the transport modes  contribute to total and relative energy demand. next,  selections of measures for reducing total and specific energy  transport consumption are put forward for each mode.  measures are grouped as either behavioural or technical.  the three ways to decrease energy demand in the transport  sector examined are:  • reduction of transport demand of high energy intensity  modes  • modal shift from high energy intensive transport to low  energy intensity modes  • energy efficiency improvements.  12.2.1 behavioural measures to reduce transport  energy demand  understanding people and behaviour is the key. sustainability  is about our lifestyle choices. it is about how people live their  daily lives and, as humans, how we base our decisions on our  surrounding environment. most people make decisions based  on what is convenient and inviting. the energy [r]evolution  transport pathways do not rely on the very few idealists who  always do ‘the right thing’. therefore, cities in particular have  to change so that making the ‘right choice’ will be also the  ‘easiest choice.’  energy  [r]evolution    greenpeace promotes sustainable mobility via three different  approaches:  1. avoid: avoid transport where it is not necessary by  embracing the ‘compact city’ model.  2. shift: encourage the use of more sustainable transport  (such as public transport, walking, cycling) and discourage  usage of private motorized transport.  3. improve: the least efficient modes of transport (such as  private cars) have to become as efficient as possible.  the point of departure for an urban mobility strategic  concept that promotes sustainable mobility is the quality of  the public realm, with its streets and spaces that stimulate  sustainable mobility choices to contribute to quality of life –  safe, economical, sustainable, inclusive (Greenpeace  Germany 2015):6  • reduction of car dependency  • sustainable transportation modes  • more efficient land use by density  • mixed-use development that form mixed-modal urban hubs  that are easily accessible destination points.  technical measures – urban electric mobility  currently, to achieve a locally emission-free land transport  option, electric motors are utilized as the main powertrain.  the electricity may be provided to the electric motor via  several means either on or off-board:  • battery electric powertrain: the electricity is generated offboard  and stored on-board via electro-chemical energy  storage units,  • catenary electric powertrain: the electricity is generated  off-board and constantly supplied to the vehicle via an  external catenary during driving,  • fuel cell electric powertrain: the electricity is generated onboard  with a fuel cell via reaction of hydrogen and oxygen  battery electric powertrain  a battery electric vehicle (bev) utilizes an electric motor to  convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and requires a  battery for the energy storage. the battery is connected to  electric motor via a dc/ac converter including a control system  (Grunditz, 2014).7 most of the bevs have a gearbox with only  one gear ratio (lienkamp, 2014).8 if the vehicle has only one  central electric motor, then a differential is needed similar to  those in conventional vehicles. the structure of a bev with a  central electric motor is presented schematically in figure 12.3.  the battery is considered to be one of the most critical  components of electrified vehicles due to its cost-intensive  nature. furthermore, batteries have lower energy density  resulting in limited driving ranges combined with high  volumes and masses of the energy storage system.  therefore, batteries (especially lithium-based ones) have  been subject to tremendous research efforts in recent years  and this trend is expected to continue in the following years  (Wagner, preschitschek et al., 2013)9 with improvements in  costs, life expectancy and energy density.    several quick battery charging strategies for battery electric  road and rail vehicles beyond common conductive cablebased  charging have emerged in recent years (some of which  have already entered commercialization):  • conductive quick charging: this strategy is mainly designed  for buses and trams. the charging at high power rates (200-  500 kW) is performed at intermediate and turning points via  extendable pantographs; a demonstration project for buses  is, for example, in day-to-day use in Geneva, switzerland  (sae off-highway engineering online, 2013).10  • inductive quick charging:  ◦ several research and demonstration projects on  inductive charging at traffic lights or even dynamically inroad-  charging exist for passenger cars (eGvi, 2014;  Wich, 2014).11  ◦ for buses at intermediate stops and 10-30 minutes recharging  at turning points, several research,  demonstration and commercialization projects are  underway operating with a charging power of 50-200 kW  (fta, 2014b).12  • battery swapping stations  ◦ china has used robotic battery swapping stations for its  urban battery electric buses in several cities since 2008  (li, 2013).13  ◦ battery car maker tesla has installed a commercial  battery swap station in california allowing a battery swap  in about 3 minutes (forbes, 2014).14  • both inductive charging at stations and battery swap  stations demand high infrastructural investments but  enable a reduction of on-board battery capacity, weight,  and hence vehicle cost (and allowing also an increase of  passenger load).  although battery-electric drivetrains could also be applied to  rail applications, only road battery electric vehicles are  considered in this study since external catenary systems are  best suited to rail-bound urban mass rapid transit systems.  the advantages of battery electric road vehicles compared to  conventional internal combustion engine vehicles are  summarized below:  • Zero local emissions  • significant lower well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions  possible (depending on the electricity generation)  • lower variable costs (mainly fuel)  • higher torque compared to internal combustion engine at  low speed  • lower vibrations and noise  however, battery electric road vehicles have also some  drawbacks compared to internal combustion engine vehicles,  which include: :  • limited driving range due to lower energy density  • longer charging time,  • additional infrastructure requirement for charging points  • higher purchase costs (at the moment)  catenary electric powertrain  public transport systems, such as trams (light rail trains),  metro, commuter train and trolley bus systems are operated  on rail or road networks equipped with electric overhead wires  or third rails alongside the track. the electric power is  continuously transferred to the vehicle via the wire or third rail,  usually direct current (dc) with 500 – 1500 v, and drawn by a  current collector installed on the vehicle. sometimes, also  alternate current (ac) systems with higher voltages are  applied in commuter rail systems. urban tram, metro and  usually also commuter rail systems draw the electricity from  an overhead catenary or a third rail. road trolley buses  operate with special current collectors under two overhead  wires; one is to draw the current from the wire and the other  to close the circuit. in recent years, overhead catenary trucks  for goods transport on roads have been in discussion (den  boer, aarnik et al., 2013)15, but no such system has begun to  enter commercial service in an urban environment up to now.  furthermore, overhead catenary trucks are not expected to be  in service in the megacities in the near future (about 5 years).  in general, overhead catenary systems can be distinguished  by transport application as presented in table 12.2.    vehicles drawing traction electricity continuously from a  catenary are advantageous over battery electric and fuel cell  vehicles in terms of the following aspects:  • the traction energy is continuously drawn from an external  current wire making expensive and heavy vehicle on-board  storage systems unnecessary,  • there is no need to refuel (as with fuel cell hydrogen  vehicles) or to recharge (as with battery electric vehicles)  and, thus, the operating range, within network borders, is  not limited,  • high vehicle efficiency levels (80-90 %),  • proven and well-known system on infrastructure and  vehicle level for decades,  • especially useful for highly frequented public transport  networks.  in certain cases, however, overhead electrification may not  prove advantageous over battery electric and fuel cell  vehicles. some drawbacks of catenary electrification include:  • visual intrusion through overhead wire network, undesired  especially in historically valuable city areas,  • high capital expenditure for wayside energy infrastructure  that may not pay off in case of low line-capacity utilization,  • vehicles are bound to the fixed catenary network,  • application restricted to public transport systems – the  system is not useable for passenger cars.  fuel cell electric powertrain  in contrary to the vehicle using batteries or overhead lines,  fuel cell- and hybrid electric vehicles provide traction power  by using a fuel cell as energy converter of chemical energy  (mostly hydrogen) into electrical energy based on ionic  catalytic breakdown of the molecular fuel at the anode. figure  11.4 illustrates an exemplary fuel cell powertrain with a  central electric motor. key elements of this system are the  hydrogen storage and fuel cell system.  there are several ways to store hydrogen on board, such as in  liquid form, compressed under high pressure, or via physical  and chemical compounds (eichlseder and klell, 2012).16 the  state of the art is compressed hydrogen storage under 350  and 700 bar using composite materials for the tanks, which  prevents hydrogen diffusion and ensures safety. the 700 bar  technology allows for a higher energy storage capacity than  350 bar storage. energy losses due to compression amounts  to approximately 15 % of the energy content of hydrogen,  significantly less than hydrogen stored in liquid form (30-40 %  losses) (ferrari, offinger et al., 2012).17  there are several fuel cell types. in cars, pem fuel cells are  used. the reactants here are hydrogen (h2) at the anode and  oxygen (o2) at the cathode. the only waste product of the  reaction is water.  although fuel cell electric vehicles (fcevs) could also be used  for rail applications, only road vehicles are considered in this  study. the advantages of fuel cell electric road vehicles are  summarized below:  292    • Zero local emissions  • possibly lower well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions  than internal combustion engine vehicles (depending on  how the hydrogen is produced)  • high efficiency of fuel cells compared to internal  combustion engine, particularly at low temperatures  • lower vibrations and noise than conventional vehicles  • higher range of operation than bevs  • significant shorter refueling times than recharging times for  bevs  however, fuel cell electric road vehicles have also some  drawbacks, which include:  • higher purchase costs (even higher than bevs)  • requirement to build a hydrogen infrastructure  • high purity requirements and high cost of hydrogen as fuel  • durability and long-term performance of fuel cell stack  especially for transient operation  step 1: reduction of transport demand  to use less transport overall means reducing the amount of  ‘passenger-km (p-km)’ travelled per capita and reducing  freight transport demand. the amount of freight transport is  to a large extent linked to Gdp development and therefore  difficult to influence. however, improved logistics – for  example, optimal load profiles for trucks and a shift to  regionally produced goods – can reduce transport demand.  passenger transport:  the study focussed on the change in passenger km per  capita of high-energy intensity air transport and personal  vehicles modes. passenger transport by light duty vehicles  (ldv), for example, is energy-demanding both in absolute  and relative terms. policy measures that enforce a reduction  of passenger km travelled by individual transport modes are  an effective means to reduce transport energy demand.  policy measures for reducing passenger transport demand in  general could include:  • charge and tax policies that increase transport costs for  individual transport  • price incentives for using public transport modes  • installation or upgrading of public transport systems  • incentives for working from home  • stimulating the use of video conferencing in business  • improved cycle paths in cities.  in the reference scenario, there is a forecast increase in  passenger-km in all regions up to 2050. for the 2050 energy  [r]evolution scenario, there is still a rise, but it would be  much flatter. for oecd europe and oecd north america  there will even be a decline in individual transport on a per  capita basis.  the reduction in passenger-km per capita in the advanced  energy [r]evolution scenario compared to the reference  scenario comes with a general reduction in car use due to  behavioural and traffic policy changes and partly with a shift  of transport to public modes.  a shift from energy-intensive individual transport to low-energy  demand public transport goes align with an increase  in low-energy public transport person-km.  freight transport:  it is difficult to estimate a reduction in freight transport.  neither energy [r]evolution scenario includes a model for  reduced volume for required freight transport, but it is  assumed that a modular shift from road to rail and/or to  battery or fuel cell power transport vehicles takes place.  step 2: changes in transport mode  determining which vehicles and transport modes are the  most efficient for each purpose requires an analysis of the  transport mode technologies. then, the energy use and  intensity of each type of transport is used to calculate energy  savings resulting from a transport mode shift. the following  information is required:  • passenger transport: energy demand per passenger  kilometer, measured in mj/p-km.  • freight transport: energy demand per kilometre of  transported tonne of goods, measured in mj/tonne-km.  for this study, passenger transport includes light duty  vehicles, passenger rail and air transport. freight transport  includes medium duty vehicles, heavy duty vehicles, inland  navigation, marine transport and freight rail. Wbcsd 2004  data was used in (dlr 2012) as baseline data and updated  where more recent information was available.  passenger transport:  travelling by rail is the most efficient – but car transport  improves strongly. figure 12.5 shows the worldwide average  specific energy consumption (energy intensity) by transport  mode in the base year and in the energy [r]evolution scenario  in 2050. this data differs for each region. there is a large  difference in specific energy consumption among the  transport modes. passenger transport by rail will consume  28% less energy in 2050 than car transport and 85% less  than aviation on a per p-km basis, so shifting from road to rail  can produce large energy savings.    18 accordinG to (dlr 2012) for the 2012 edition of enerGy [r]evolution – the advanced enerGy [r]evolution  introduces the same efficiency technoloGies faster.  from figure 12.5, we can conclude that passengers will need  to shift from cars and especially air transport to less energy-intensive  passenger rail transport in order to reduce transport  energy demand.  the energy [r]evolution scenario assumes that a certain  proportion of passenger-kilometer of domestic air traffic and  intraregional air traffic (i. e., traffic among two countries of  one iea region) is suitable to be substituted by high speed rail  (hsr). for international aviation, there is obviously no  substitution potential to other modes whatsoever.  table 12.3 displays the relative model shifts used in the  calculation for the energy [r]evolution scenarios. Where the  shares are higher, cities are closer to each other, so a  substitution by high speed trains is a more realistic option (i.  e. distances of up to 800 – 1,000 km, compared to countries  where they are far apart).  freight transport:  similar to figure 12.5, which showed average specific energy  consumption for passenger transport modes, figure 12.6  shows the respective energy consumption for various freight  transport modes in 2009 and in energy [r]evolution scenarios  2050, the values are weighted according to stock and traffic  performance.  energy intensity for all modes of transport is expected to  decrease by 2050. in absolute terms, road transport has the  largest efficiency gains whereas transport on rail and on  water remain the modes with the lowest relative energy  demand per tonne-km. rail freight transport will consume 80-  90% less energy per tonne-km in 2050 than long haul hdv.  this means that large energy savings can be made following  a shift from road to rail.    modal shifts for transporting goods in the energy [r]evolution  in the energy [r]evolution scenarios, as much road freight as  possible should be shifted from road freight transport to less  energy intensive freight rail to gain maximum energy savings  from modal shifts.  since the use of ships largely depends on geography, a  modal shift is not proposed for national ships but instead a  shift towards freight rail. as the goods transported by  medium duty vehicles are mainly going to regional  destinations (and are therefore not suitable for the long  distance nature of freight rail transport), no modal shift to rail  is assumed for this transport type.  for long-haul heavy duty vehicles transport, however,  especially low value density, heavy goods that are  transported on a long range are suitable for a modal shift to  railways (tavasszy 2011).19  step 3: technical efficiency improvements  energy efficiency improvements are the third important way of  reducing transport energy demand. this section explains  ways for improving energy efficiency up to 2050 for each type  of transport, namely:  • air transport  • passenger and freight trains  • trucks  • inland navigation and marine transport  • cars  in general, an integral part of an energy reduction scheme is  an increase in the load factor – both for freight and passenger  transport. as the load factor increases, fewer vehicles need  to be employed, so the energy intensity decreases when  measured per passenger-km or tonne-km.  in aviation, there are already sophisticated efforts to optimise  the load factor; however, for other modes such as road and  rail freight transport there is still room for improvement. for  freight transport, logistics and supply chain planning can  improve load factors, while enhanced capacity utilisation will  do so in passenger transport.  air transport  a study conducted by nasa (nasa 2011)20 shows that the  energy use of new subsonic aircrafts can be reduced by up  to 58% up to 2035. potentially, up to 81% reductions in co2  emissions are achievable when using biofuels. (akerman  2005)21 reports that a 65% reduction in fuel use is technically  feasible by 2050. technologies to reduce fuel consumption of  aircrafts mainly comprise:  • aerodynamic adaptations to reduce the drag of the aircraft,  for example by improved control of laminar flow, the use of  riblets and multi-functional structures, the reduction in  fasteners, flap fairings and the tail size as well as advanced  supercritical airfoil technologies.  • structural technologies to reduce the weight of the aircraft  while at the same time increasing stiffness. examples  include the use of new lightweight materials like advanced  metals, composites and ceramics, the use of improved  coatings, and the optimised design of multi-functional,  integrated structures.  • subsystem technologies, including advanced power  management and generation along with optimised flight  avionics and wiring.  • propulsion technologies like advanced gas turbines for  powering the aircraft more efficiently, possibly including:  ◦ improved combustion emission measures,  improvements in cold and hot section materials, and the  use of turbine blade/vane technology;  ◦ investigation of all-electric, fuel-cell gas turbine and  electric gas turbine hybrid propulsion devices;  ◦ electric propulsion technologies comprise advanced  lightweight motors, motor controllers and power  conditioning equipment (icao 2008).22    the scenario projects a 50% improvement in specific energy  consumption on a per passenger-km basis for future aircrafts  in 2050 based on todays energy intensities. figure 12.8  shows the energy intensities in the energy [r]evolution  scenario for international, intraregional and domestic aviation.  finally figure 12.9 shows the final energy consumption by  technologies in the reference and in both energy  [r]evolution scenarios.  passenger and freight trains  transport of passengers and freight by rail is currently one of  the most energy efficient means of transport. however, there  is still potential to reduce the specific energy consumption of  trains. apart from operational and policy measures to reduce  energy consumption like raising the load factor of trains,  technological measures to reduce energy consumption of  future trains are necessary, too. key technologies are:  • reducing the total weight of a train as the most significant  measure to reduce traction energy consumption. by using  lightweight structures and lightweight materials, the energy  needed to overcome inertial and grade resistances as well  as friction from tractive resistances can be reduced.  • aerodynamic improvements to reduce aerodynamic drag,  especially important when running on high velocity. a  reduction of aerodynamic drag is typically achieved by  streamlining the profile of the train.    • switch from diesel-fuelled to more energy efficient  electrically driven trains.  • improvements in the traction system to further reduce  frictional losses. technical options include improvements of  the major components and in energy management software.  • regenerative braking to recover waste energy. the energy  can either be transferred back into the grid or stored onboard  in an energy storage device. regenerative braking is  especially effective in regional traffic with frequent stops.  • improved space utilisation to achieve more efficient energy  consumption per passenger kilometre. the simplest way to  achieve this is to transport more passengers per train – in  other words, by a higher average load factor, more flexible  and shorter trainsets or by the use of double-decker trains  on highly frequented routes.  • improved accessory functions, such as for passenger  comfort. a high energy efficiency potential lies in the new  design of heating and cooling equipment. some strategies  for efficiency include adjustments to cabin design, changes  to air intakes, and using waste heat from traction.  by researching technologies for advanced high-speed trains,  the dlr’s ‘next Generation train’ project aims to reduce the  specific energy consumption per passenger-kilometre by  50% relative to existing high speed trains in the future.  the energy [r]evolution scenario uses energy intensity data  of (tosca 2011)23 for electric and diesel fuelled trains in  europe as input for our calculations. these data were  available for 2009 and as forecasts for 2025 and 2050.  the region-specific efficiency factors and shares of  diesel/electric traction traffic performance were used to  calculate energy intensity data per region (mj/p-km) for 2012  and up to 2050. the same methodology was applied for rail  freight transport.  electric trains as of today are about 2 to 3.5 times less  energy-intensive than diesel trains depending on the specific  type of rail transport, so the projections to 2050 include a  massive shift away from diesel to electric traction in the  energy [r]evolution 2050 scenario.  the region-specific efficiency factors for passenger rail take  into account higher load factors, for example in china and  india. energy intensity for freight rail is based on the  assumptions that regions with longer average distances for  freight rail (such as the us and russia) and where more raw  materials are transported (such as coal) show a lower energy  intensity than other regions (fulton & eads 2004).24 future  projections use ten-year historic iea data.  the calculation of possible future development in the rail  transport sector under the descripted assumption leads to the  results shown in figure 12.14. under the energy [r]evolution  scenarios over 90% of all rail lines are electrified by 2040.    heavy and medium duty vehicles (freight by road)  freight transport on the road forms the backbone of logistics  in many regions of the world. but apart from air freight  transport, it is the most energy-intensive way of moving  goods around. however, gradual progress is being made in  the fields of drivetrain efficiency, lightweight construction,  alternative power trains and fuels and so on.  this study projected a major shift in drivetrain market share of  medium (mdv) and heavy duty vehicles (hdv) in the energy  [r]evolution scenarios in the future. today, the great majority  of mdvs and hdvs have internal combustion engines, fuelled  mainly by diesel and in mdv also by a small share of gasoline  and gas (cnG and lpG). the energy [r]evolution model  includes a major shift to electric and fuel cell hydrogen-powered  vehicles (fcv) by 2050.  the electric mdv stock in the model developed by (dlr  2012) is mainly composed of battery electric vehicles (bev),  and a relevant share of hybrid electric vehicles (hev). hybrid  electric vehicles will have also displaced conventional internal  combustion engines in heavy duty vehicles. in addition to  this, both electric vehicles supplied with current via overhead  catenary lines and bevs are modelled in the energy  [r]evolution scenario for hdv applications.  siemens has proved the technical feasibility of the catenary  technology for trucks with experimental vehicles in its  ehighway project. the trucks are equipped with a hybrid  diesel powertrain to be able to operate when not connected  to the overhead line. When under a catenary line, the trucks  can operate fully electric at speeds of up to 90 km/h. apart  from electrically operated trucks fed by an overhead catenary,  inductive power supply via induction loops under the  pavement could become an option.  in addition to the electric truck fleet in the energy [r]evolution  scenario, hdv and mdv powered by fuel cells (fcv) were  integrated into the vehicle stock, too. fcv are beneficial especially  for long haul transports where no overhead catenary lines are  available and the driving range of bev would not be sufficient.  energy [r]evolution fleet average transport energy intensities  for mdv and hdv were derived using region-specific iea  energy intensity data of mdv and hdv transport by 2050  (Wbscd 2004),25 with the specific energy consumption factors  of table 12.4 applied to the iea data and matched with the  region-specific market shares of the power train technologies.  the reduction between the current situation and 2050 in the  advanced energy [r]evolution on a per tonne-km basis is  then 50-60% for mdv and hdv.    the dlr’s institute of vehicle concepts conducted special studies  to look at future vehicle concepts to see what the potential might  be for reducing the overall energy consumption of existing and  future trucks when applying energy efficient technologies (dlr  2012)/(dlr 2015). the approach shows the potential of different  technologies influencing the energy efficiency of future trucks and  also indicates possible cost developments.  inland navigation  technical measures to reduce energy consumption of inland  vessels include (van rompuy 2010)26:  • aerodynamic improvements to the hull to reduce friction resistance  • improving the propeller design to increase efficiency  • enhancing engine efficiency.  for inland navigation, we assumed a reduction of 40% of  global averaged energy intensity to 0.3 mj/t-km from the  current value of 0.5 mj/t-km.  marine transport  several technological measures can be applied to new vessels in  order to reduce overall fuel consumption in national and  international marine transport. these technologies are, for example:  • weather routing to optimise the vessel’s route  • autopilot adjustments to minimise steering  • improved hull coatings to reduce friction losses  • improved hull openings to optimise water flow  • air lubrication systems to reduce water resistances  • improvements in the design and shape of the hull and rudder  • waste heat recovery systems to increase overall efficiency  • improvement of the diesel engine (e.g. common-rail technology)  • installing new wind energy technologies such as towing  kites, flettner turbines and advanced sailing rigs to use  wind energy for propulsion  • using solar energy for on-board power demand  adding each technology effectiveness figure stated by (icct  2011),27 these technologies have a potential to improve energy  efficiency of new vessels between 18.4% and about 57%.  another option to reduce energy demand of ships is simply to  reduce operating speeds. up to 36% of fuel consumption can  be saved by reducing the vessel’s speed by 20%. a 25%  reduction of fuel consumption for an international marine diesel  fleet is achievable by using more efficient alternative propulsion  devices only (eyring et al. 2005).28 up to 30% reduction in  energy demand is achievable only by optimising the hull shape  and propulsion devices of new vessels (marintek 2000).29  the model assumes a total of 40% energy efficiency  improvement potential for international shipping. in order to  phase out fossil fuels entirely from marine transports, a mix of  energy efficiency (including new wind drives), biofuels and  synfuels powered engines are required.    box 12.1 | case study: wind powered ships  introduced to commercial operation in 2007, the skysails  system uses wind power, which has no fuel costs, to  contribute to the motion of large freight-carrying ships, which  currently use increasingly expensive and environmentally  damaging oil. instead of a traditional sail fitted to a mast, the  system uses large towing kites to contribute to the ship’s  propulsion. shaped like paragliders, they are tethered to the  vessel by ropes and can be controlled automatically,  responding to wind conditions and the ship’s trajectory.  the kites can operate at altitudes of between 100 and 300  metres, where there are stronger and more stable winds. With  dynamic flight patterns, the skysails are able to generate five  times more power per square metre of sail area than  conventional sails. depending on the prevailing winds, the  company claims that a ship’s average annual fuel costs can  be reduced by 10% to 35%. under optimal wind conditions,  fuel consumption can temporarily be cut by 50%.  on the first voyage of the beluga skysails, a 133 m long  specially-built cargo ship, the towing kite propulsion system  was able to temporarily substitute for approximately 20% of  the vessel’s main engine power, even in moderate winds.  the company is now planning a kite twice the size of this  160m2 pilot.  the designers say that virtually all sea-going cargo vessels  can be retro- or outfitted with the skysails propulsion sytsem  without extensive modifications.  besides skysails, there are flettner-rotors, new sailing rigs  such as dynariG and other wind energy systems for ships in  development. Greenpeace supports the implementation of  new wind energy technologies to reduce marine fuel demand  and to replace bunker fuels and demands for financial  support program for research and development (r&d).  passenger cars  many technologies can be used to improve the fuel efficiency  of passenger cars. examples include improvements in  engines, weight reduction as well as friction and drag  reduction.  the impact of the various measures on fuel efficiency can be  substantial. hybrid vehicles, combining a conventional  combustion engine with an electric engine, have relatively low  fuel consumption. the most well-known is the toyota prius,  which originally had a fuel efficiency of about 5 litres of  gasoline equivalent per 100 km (litre ge/100 km). in 2012,  toyota presented an improved version with a lower fuel    we have assumed that the occupancy rate for cars remains  nearly the same as in 2009, as shown in figure 12.13.  table 12.5 summarises the energy efficiency improvement  for passenger transport in the energy [R]evolution 2050  scenario and table 12.6 shows the energy efficiency  improvement for freight transport in the advanced energy  [R]evolution 2050 scenario.  figure 12.14 provides an overview about electric transport  vehicles for urban areas. the figures are results of a specific  research commissioned from greenpeace international for  public and energy efficient individual transport technologies.  energy  [r]evolution  12  consumption of 4.3 litres ge/100 km. new lightweight  materials, in combination with new propulsion technologies,  can bring fuel consumption levels down to 1 litre ge/100 km.  the figure 12.12 gives the energy intensities calculated using  power train market shares and efficiency improvements for LDv in  the Reference scenario and in the energy [R]evolution scenario.  the energy intensities for car passenger transport are currently  highest in oecD north america and lowest in oecD europe.  the Reference scenario shows a decrease in energy intensities  in all regions, but the division between highest and lowest will  remain the same, although there will be some convergence.      12.3 prOJectiOn Of the future car market  12.3.1 prOJectiOn Of the future technOlOgy mix  achieving the substantial co2 -reduction targets in the energy  [R]evolution scenario would require a radical shift in fuels for  cars and other light duty vehicles. for viable, full  electrification based on renewable energy sources, the model  assumes that petrol and diesel fuelled autonomous hybrids  and plug-in hybrids that we have today are phased out  already by 2050 in the advanced energy [R]evolution  scenario. thus, two generations of hybrid technologies will  pave the way for the complete transformation to light duty  vehicles with full battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell  powertrains. this is the only way that is efficient enough for  the use of renewable energy to reach the co2 -targets in the  car sector.  in the future, it may not be possible to power cars for all  purposes by rechargeable batteries only. therefore, hydrogen  and synfuels are required as a renewable fuel especially for  larger cars including light commercial vehicles. biofuels and  synfuels will be used in other applications where a  substitution is even harder than for cars. figure 12.15 shows  the share of fuel cell vehicles (autonomous hybrids) and full  battery electric vehicles (grid connectable) in 2050 in the new  vehicle market according to the projections in (DLR 2012).  12.3.2 prOJectiOn Of the future vehicle segment split  the scenario is constructed to disaggregate the light-duty  vehicle sales into three segments: small, medium and large  vehicles. this model shows the effect of ‘driving small urban  cars’ to see if they are suitable for megacities of the future.  the size and co2 emissions of the vehicles are particularly  interesting in the light of the enormous growth predicted in  the LDv stock. for our purposes, we could divide up the  numerous car types as follows:  • the very small car bracket includes city, super-mini, minicompact  cars as well as one and two seaters.  • the small sized bracket includes compact and subcompact  cars, micro and subcompact vans and small suvs.  • the medium sized bracket includes car derived vans and  small station wagons, upper medium class, midsize cars  and station wagons, executive class, compact passenger  vans, car derived pickups, medium suvs, 2wD and 4wD.  • the large car bracket includes all kinds of luxury class, luxury  multi-purpose vehicles, medium and heavy vans, compact  and full-size pickup trucks (2wD, 4wD), standard and luxury  suvs. in addition, we looked at light duty trucks in north  america and light commercial vehicles in china separately.    2050  in examining the segment split, we have focused most  strongly on the two world regions which will be the largest  emitters of co2 from cars in 2050: north america and china.  in north america today, the small vehicle segment is almost  non-existent. we found it necessary to introduce here small  cars substantially, triggered by rising fuel prices and possibly  vehicle taxes. for china, we have anticipated a similar share  of the mature car market as for europe and projected that the  small segment will grow by 3% per year at the expenses of  the larger segments in the light of rising mass mobility. the  segment split is shown in figure 12.16.  12.3.3 prOJectiOn Of the future switch tO  alternative fuels  a switch to renewable fuels in the car fleet is one of the  cornerstones of the low co2 car scenario, with the most  prominent element the direct use of renewable electricity in  cars. the different types of electric and hybrid cars, such as  battery electric and plug-in hybrid, are summarised as ‘plug-in  electric’. their introduction will start in industrialised countries  between 2015 and 2020, following an s-curve pattern, and are  projected to reach 35-40% of total LDv sales in the eu, north  america and the oecD asia oceania by 2050. Due to the  higher costs of the technology and renewable electricity  availability, we have slightly delayed progress in other  countries. more cautious targets are applied for africa.  there are huge differences in forecasts for the growth of  vehicle sales in developing countries. in general, the increase  in sales and thus vehicle stock and ownership is linked to the  forecast of gDp growth, which is a well-established  correlation in the science community. however, this scenario  analysis found that technology shift in LDvs alone – although  linked to enormous efficiency gains and fuel switch - is not  enough to fulfil the ambitious energy [R]evolution co2 targets.  a slowdown of vehicle sales growth and a limitation or even  reduction in vehicle ownership per capita compared to the  Reference scenario was thus required.  global urbanisation, the on-going rise of megacities, where  space for parking is scarce, and the trend starting today that  ownership of cars might not be seen as desirable as in the  past draws a different scenario of the future compared to the  reference case. going against the global pattern of a century,  this development would have to be supported by massive  policy intervention to promote modal shift and alternative  forms of car usage. for megacities, greenpeace  commissioned an additional specific research, key results are  presented in table 12.7.  12.3.4 prOJectiOn Of the future kilOmetres driven  per year  until a full shift from fossil to renewable fuels has taken place,  driving on the road will create co2 emissions. thus, driving  less contributes to our target for emissions reduction.  however, this shift does not have to mean reduced mobility  equally because there are many excellent opportunities for  shifts from individual passenger road transport towards less  co2 -intensive public and non-motorised transport.  Data on average annual kilometres driven are uncertain in  many world regions except for north america, europe and  recently china. the scenario starts from the state-of-the-art  knowledge on how LDvs are driven in the different world  regions and then projects a decline in car usage. this is a  further major building block in the low carbon strategy of the  energy [R]evolution scenarios, which goes hand in hand  with new mobility concepts like co-modality and car-sharing  concepts. in 2050, policies supporting the use of public  transport and environmental friendly modes are anticipated  to be in place in all world regions. our scenario of annual  kilometres driven (akD) by LDvs is shown in figure 12.17.  in total, akD fall almost by one quarter until 2050 compared  to 2012.    figure 12.18 shows the final energy consumption by  technologies under 3 scenarios for road transport. the  implementation of new alternatives drives – mainly in  combination with electric machines – start to have an impact  after 2025 and can take over a significant share after 2035.  synfuels, however are believed to be equally important  especially for large vehicles including trucks and busses.    12.4 cOnclusiOn  in a business as usual world we project a high rise of  transport energy demand until 2050 in all world regions in the  Reference scenario, which is fuelled especially by fast  developing countries like china and india.  the aim of this chapter was therefore to show ways to  reduce energy demand in general and the dependency on  climate damaging fossil fuels in the transport sector. the  findings of our scenario calculations show that a combination  of behavioural changes and tremendous technical efforts is  needed in order to reach the ambitious energy reduction  goals of the energy [R]evolution scenario:  • a decrease of passenger and freight kilometres on a per  capita base  • a massive shift to electrically and hydrogen powered vehicles  whose energy sources may be produced by renewables  • a gradual decrease of all modes’ energy intensities by  technological progress  • a modal shift from aviation to high speed rail and from road  freight to rail freight.  these measures must of course be accompanied by major  efforts in the installation and extension of the necessary  infrastructures as for example in railway networks hydrogen  and battery charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and  an electrification of highways.  figure 12.19 shows the development of the regional shares of  transport demands by region under both energy [R]evolution  scenarios between 2012 and 2050. the main difference is a  more equal distribution of the transport energy demand  across all regions in regard to transport energy per person.

IBON-2.txt,"1  Key Asks for  Climate Justice and System Change  2  Roots and Impacts of Climate Change  As early as the 1970s, climate change impacts have already been raised as a scientific  concern and at present, it is dubbed as the greatest catastrophe of the 21st century.  Every year, climate change is contributing to the deaths of nearly 400,000 people  mostly from developing countries. Their deaths mainly caused by extreme weather  conditions, malnutrition, poverty and infectious diseases (Harvey, 2012).  Climate change is a long-term shift in the Earth’s climate conditions. Specifically, the  biggest factor in these changes is a steady increase in the average global temperature  level caused by the buildup of Green House Gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. This  increase in GHG is due to natural activities (such as volcanic activities, varying solar  output and the changing Earth’s orbit) and human activities (such as burning of fossil  fuels, land use change, and energy and industrial processes). Since the beginning of  the Industrial Revolution (around 1750), human impact on climate change greatly  exceeded that of the natural activities mainly from the burning of fossil fuels.  Greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically increased since the pre-industrial period  mainly by economic and population growth. Because of the needed expansion for  economic activities, in order to cater the needs and demands of the growing global  population, greater demand for energy and materials use is required. Hence, greater  GHG emissions from various industries are produced.  Global warming is already producing extreme weather patterns around the world.  According to a recent UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) review (2015),  87% of disasters in 2014 are climate-related. About 80% of the disasters in the last  decade (2000-2010) were due to the storms and flooding. In Russia, more than 55,000  people died from heat wave in 2010 (Goldenberg, 2014). In 2013, Typhoon “Haiyan”,  one of the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded, devastated the Philippines and left  more than 6,000 people dead (CNN, 2013). Rising temperature in the Arctic region is  causing massive melting of sea ice and permafrost. Animals like polar bears and ringed  seals are already affected due to the loss of ice habitat and food (WWF, 2015a). If  humans do not curb their carbon emissions, the increasing threat of global warming  could wipe out one-fourth of all plants and animals into extinction within 100 years (US  EPA, 2014). The impact of the decrease in food production due to climate change is  already aggravating the hunger and malnutrition problem in the world. According to the  World Food Programme (WFP) (2015), the risk of hunger and malnutrition could  increase by 20% by year 2050 if the impact of climate change in the global food system  will not be lessened.  3  International Community’s Response  As early in the 1960s and 1970s, climatologists already noticed increasing carbon  dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. Global temperature increase also raised  alarms with media and the public in the 1908s, and world leaders meeting for the 1992  United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de  Janeiro also known as the ¨Earth Summit¨ singled it out as an urgent issue that must be  addressed. Its main message focused on the need for states to recognize and redirect  their plans and policies to ensure that they would take into account any environmental  impact from their economic decisions (UN, 1997). Three important agreements were  adopted: the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21 and the  Forest Principles. In addition, two important legally binding agreements were signed at  the Earth Summit, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), this last with the aim of  stabilizing GHG concentrations “at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic  (human induced) interference with the climate system” (UNFCCC, 2014).  In 1997 the Kyoto Protocol (KP) was adopted under the UNFCCC as the first legally  binding tool that focused on the mitigation of greenhouse gases. Under the KP, 36  developed nations committed to reduce their emissions by 4% during the first  commitment period (CP1). The US, one of the biggest emitters of GHG in the world, has  never ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Three flexibility mechanisms were introduced to the  Protocol at the behest of industrialized countries led by the US: International Emissions  Trading, Joint Implementation and the Clean Development Mechanism. In 2014, official  data on the CP1 showed that the commitment of reductions was surpassed reducing  the emissions globally by 24 percent. However, this reduction was caused mainly by the  so-called and criticized ¨hot air¨, or the emission reductions that already occurred in  economies in transition before 1997. Furthermore, despite the low need of using flexible  mechanisms, developing countries actively used all of them to accomplish their  commitments (Climate Report N° 44, May 2014).  Currently, negotiations under the UNFCCC are offering market-based mechanisms,  technology-obsessed fixes, and financial schemes as part of a basket of solutions to  solve the climate crisis. One example is the REDD mechanism which stands for  Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation. Its objective is to  reduce GHG emissions by offering incentives to developing countries to conserve  forests, which serve as natural carbon sinks. Because of the limited scope of the  original REDD, it was expanded into REDD+ to further increase forest cover through  conservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement of forest carbon stock.  (UN-REDD 2009). One of the main criticisms is that it is a form of carbon offset, which  again allows industrialized countries and TNCs to avoid reducing their own GHG  emissions by financing emission-reduction projects in the global South.  4  Key Asks for Climate Justice and System Change  A. Climate Justice: climate change, its causes and effects are a matter  of justice, first and foremost  It is time to fully recognize that climate change is not only an environmental issue but  also a matter of justice since it arises from the gross injustices of capitalism driven by  profit and accumulation. It is not simply a matter of differing levels of development since  the historical difference in levels of development resulted from exploitation by centuries  of colonialism and continuing neocolonialism. It is a human issue with immediate  implications for jobs, homes, health, food, and lives. Those who are hit first and hardest  are those who contributed least to the problem. Climate change will only exacerbate  poverty and widen the gap between the small rich section and the poorest of the world.  Therefore, in order to address climate change and its impacts from an approach of  justice, the following aspects need to be considered:  1. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities (CBDR-RC) is a top-bottom approach, which implies the distribution  of an equitable ¨global emissions budget¨ between developed and developing  countries. Developed nations, with only 25% of the world’s population, account  for 72% of the total emissions from 1850 to 2008. Their over-use of the world´s  ¨emissions budget¨ goes against the equal rights of all countries in the world to  have access to the use and enjoyment of atmospheric space.  2. Under the Copenhagen Accord, 85 countries pledged to reduce their emissions  or constrain their growth up to 2020. However, according to the UNEP Gap  Report 2014, there´s a gap between these pledges and the reduction required to  achieve the accord´s temperature limits. The country pledges and commitments  for 2020 result in only a moderate reduction in global emissions below business-as-  usual levels. The gap in 2020 is 8 – 10 Gt CO2e and the emissions gap in  2030 is estimated to be about 14 – 17 Gt CO2e. The report also expresses that  delaying stringent action till 2030 will further aggravate these risks and reduce  the likelihood of meeting the 2 °C target to 50 per cent or less which will impact  directly on the poorest and most vulnerable in the world (Emissions Gap Report,  2014).  3. The world requires immediate action. If we continue at the pace and will of the  international negotiations, it will take just six years of current emissions to  5  exhaust a carbon budget that would give a good chance of keeping global  warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. What´s even more worrying is that recent  studies related to paleo-climate records show sea-levels were six to eight meters  higher than current levels when global temperatures were less than two degrees  warmer that they are now. This means that impacts will be further more adverse  threatening our society and our world in ways we are just starting to consider and  might not ready to face (Don Bain, 2015).  4. In keeping with the principle of equity, the effort to share the remaining global  emissions budget should be based on: historical responsibility, ecological  footprint, technological and financial capabilities and the state of development of  each country. Developing countries have a responsibility to change their  development pathways to more sustainable ones, but will achieve this goal in a  global framework of justice with finance, technology transfer and capacity  development from developed countries considering the overriding priorities of  developing nations. All Southern or ""developing"" countries should shift as quickly  as possible to more equitable, just and sustainable pathways. They must commit  to clear long term emissions reductions goals.  5. The international pledges on funding must be honored and materialized. The  annual USD100 billion pledged at the COP 15 climate talks should be the floor,  not the ceiling, additional to other commitments, and transfers should start  immediately. Climate finance should be public, non-debt creating and should go  directly to peoples of the South without big corporations and private financial  intermediaries.  6. Counting ODA (official development assistance) financing as UNFCCC-compliant  climate financing is not consistent with UNFCCC article 4.3 because such climate  financing must be new and additional. The principles of equity and common but  differentiated responsibilities are elaborated in different sets of commitments (Art.  4.1 and 4.2,5,6,7,10 and 12) that provide among others, for the cooperation in  ´climate-proofing´ economic and differentiated commitments specifically for  developed country parties in relation to financing for developing countries.  7. Climate finance must be predictable. Long-term and reliable flow of finance must  be assured rather than rely on ¨voluntary contributions¨ from industrialized  countries since these will be subject to changing administration priorities and  preferences, short-term budgetary or revenue fluctuations, and horse-trading. In  addition, climate finance must be reported systematically and transparently as  6  addition to development assistance. As a justice issue in line with the CBDR and  ´polluters pay´ principle, it is owed not as aid from rich country to poor country,  but as compensatory finance from high-emissions countries to those most  vulnerable to impacts.  8. Estimates for global climate funds vary from USD 600 billion to more than USD  1.550 trillion. Therefore, international commitments on finance should be revised  and increased according to the incremental costs of inaction and the new  discoveries of science considering adaptation, mitigation and other costs related  to the impacts of climate change.  9. There must be free worldwide access to breakthrough technologies and financial  support for the transition to sustainability, especially in renewable energy and  more input-efficient technology. This includes the removal of intellectual property  rights and trade restrictions that place severe constraints on the people´s access  to climate friendly technologies.  B. Changing the system and not the climate: shift from the logic of  capital towards the logic of nature  The over-fixation of the current development model on economic growth and profit  extraction has a fundamentally contradictory relationship with nature, since its  expansionary drive entails the continued exploitation of natural resources, ever-larger  production of waste from industry and agriculture, and insatiable consumption that also  produces waste, that are abnormal or in excess of normal needs of populations and  natural resources and carrying capacity of the environment. This contradiction  stemming from this chaotic production and consumption systems is driving climate  change and other environmental changes that endanger the long-term sustainability of  life in general and the survival of particular species including human kind. In order to  embark in a transition to a more sustainable world, the following aspects are to be  considered:  1. In an ecological transition, science is indispensable for human development.  But, like any other tool, it has to function and grow more holistically. Innovation  and creativity, unshackled by the capitalist imperatives of competition,  marketability and profitability, should give rise to free and fuller development of  socially and environmentally beneficial technologies.  7  2. Extremely destructive and carbon-belching methods will have to be stopped then  soonest. Society has to undertake a transition period where the most problematic  or dirtiest branches and methods of production are steadily phased out, while  other existing ones are adapted and new, more sustainable methods are  introduced and expanded.  3. In agriculture, production should be towards ecologically sound, sustainable  production methods that conserve local ecosystems and traditional knowledge as  well as utilize appropriate farmer-controlled technologies. Consumers deserve to  be well informed about the origin and forms of productions but also bear the  responsibility to demand and look for such information as well as to support  small, local, organic farming in rural and urban environments.  4. In manufacturing, extraction and construction industries, productivity should be  continuously improved not necessarily to increase output but always to reduce  inputs of labor, energy and raw materials, as well as impose stricter limits on  waste output and environmental impact.  5. In energy production, distribution and consumption, societies should phase out  fossil fuel-based energy while scaling up alternative energy sources that are less  polluting or hazardous, more renewable, and more technically manageable.  Decentralized systems can give communities better control over energy  infrastructure and therefore better access to energy.  6. Consumer frenzy, like a destructive addiction, leads to the very opposite results  of a holistic understanding of well-being. In an alternative social system the  higher goal becomes the development of human potentials, through education,  culture, and participation in community life. Striving for human development  means a more conscious and collective effort to balance quantitative with  qualitative indicators, and material aspects with cultural and social aspects of  wellbeing.  7. In the advanced industrialized countries, economic development has reached the  point where production and consumption levels have long surpassed the real  needs of their population. These countries need to start a process of  redistribution of resources both within these countries and towards the less  developed countries of the South. The challenge in the North is how they can  reduce resource consumption within sustainable limits and in the context of truly  achieving social equality.  8  8. Meanwhile, in the global South, countries need to find new ways to develop  agricultural production to feed their people, create decent jobs, livelihood and  incomes, produce raw material inputs for environmentally friendly industry  respecting mother earth rights, increase purchasing power for goods and  services of real need and generate surplus for reinvestment from a social and  environmental perspective. The great challenge of the South is to address the  needs of the poorest through new vision and understanding of life and well-being.  9. The excessive demands and unsustainable lifestyles among the richer segments  place immense stress on the environment. There must be strong regulatory  mechanisms and limits in forms of taxes in the use of luxury products and  services. These products and those that do not attend the real needs of our  societies and communities should internalize the real environmental and social  costs of their production.  10. Market-based mechanisms (such as carbon trading schemes and REDD) cannot  be presented as solutions to the climate crisis since markets in the current  system are primarily driven by private appropriation of profits, and not the real  needs of society or the planet and the effectiveness of their contribution to  reducing emissions has been proven to be scarce. Technical solutions such as  geo-engineering or ´climate-smart agriculture´, appear only when there´s no will  to solve deep societal problems and they cause not only direct negative  impacts of the technologies themselves, but also trigger harmful activities that  are enabled by choosing a technofix approach that diverts from real solutions.  11. Real, fundamental, low- to no-risk, beneficial, long-term solutions to climate  change are already available. The main barriers to their implementation are the  polluting industries and their investors. A quick way to check the credibility and  goodwill of any geo-engineering or market based schemes proponent is to  examine how much real effort they have put into advocating for real solutions to  climate change – and to look at where their money is coming from.  C. People´s sovereignty in decision making and planning  The reason why human societies have economies is so we can produce and distribute  what we need to live, and to live well as individuals and as communities. We have seen  how capitalism puts profit over need in making decisions on what to produce, how to  produce, and how much to produce. Capitalists are able to pursue such misplaced but  profitable business decisions because they control the basic means of production. This  unequal structure of ownership is behind the profit dynamic that brings environmental  destruction, as well as exploitation, inequality, mass poverty, and oppression. The  people organized in communities, civil society organizations and other genuine  9  participatory structures are the foundation of sovereignty. In order to materialize  people´s sovereignty into ownership over productive resources these key points are to  be addressed:  1. Communities and marginalized peoples have the right to proportionate control  over planning, decision-making and management of initiatives and projects  devoted to climate change as well as to access to information, funds and  technologies. They have essential roles in defining, guiding and determining the  work of conferences and official processes for defining and managing climate  action at the local, national, regional and global levels. They should be afforded  equitable representation, meaningful participation and the power to decide over  what means to use in mitigation and adaptation.  2. Most countries, in varying degrees, are caught in the web of the global capitalist  system and are highly dependent on Northern consumer markets and sources of  finance. An abrupt or uncoordinated global transition where countries go their  own way can have very adverse consequences for the poor. International  governance and cooperation are necessary to make the global transition less  painful, positively reinforcing, and more equitable. International development  cooperation, North-to-South transfers, and South-to-South cooperation can build  on accepted principles such as country ownership, democracy and human rights,  to help facilitate the long-term reorientation of Southern development into more  sustainable and equitable development pathways.  3. The range of property rights regimes must move decisively away from an  overwhelming emphasis on private and capitalist-oriented property rights towards  more democratic, cooperative, and community-based forms of property  ownership and control or management.  4. Countries and peoples of the global South should reclaim sovereign control of  their productive and natural resources and delink them from the structures of  monopoly capitalism in order to use them for their own self-determined  development. Agrarian countries and agricultural communities can do this by  breaking the monopoly control of giant agribusiness and big landlords over land,  water, seeds and animal stock, energy sources, and other inputs and productive  assets.  5. Food production must be mainly aimed at meeting the needs of local  communities and national self-sufficiency. Access to food must be premised on  the absolute right to food of every person—food that is nutritious, safe, culturally  appropriate, and affordable.  6. Egalitarian and cooperative land tenure and land use systems should be  promoted to ensure the collective control and ecologically sustainable use of  land, water, rangeland, forest and marine resources by farmers, fishers,  pastoralists, and local mixed-economy communities.  7. In particular, the energy sector that is pivotal to the economy and to the  environment as well should mainly be publicly owned. Such ownership would  allow the public to exercise democratic control over the overhauling of existing  energy systems towards sustainable energy systems.  8. Public ownership will also be the basis for developing and promoting  transportation systems of varying appropriate scales, from bulk and long haul  transport by land, air and sea, to shorter range transport services within a region,  metropolis or rural district, with emphasis on mass transport. The automotive  industry should be taken over immediately by the state and the entire transport  sector should be regulated.  9. The finance sector is another strategic sector that must be immediately placed  under public control. By putting banks under public control, financial resources  may be rationally redirected to investments in urgently needed social services  (public health, education and decent housing) as well as investments in  renewable energy, public transportation, sustainable agriculture, and low-carbon  manufacturing.  10. Nations and communities around the world have the right to choose their  development pathways free from colonial and imperialist models based on  justice, human rights and mother earth rights.  These changes will not be achieved inside international negotiations like the  UNFCCC since only governments run by the elite and influenced by the interests  of corporations lead them. Only the people and their organizations and  movements can redefine and manage a rights-based development that is just for  people and planet."

Concretely,  1  and  2  mean  participating  in  local  struggles;  being  the  voices  in  local  struggles  that  push  for  linkage  across  municipal,  state,  regional,  and  member  state  climate  justice  constituencies;  arguing  that  now  is  the  time  for  direct  action  civil  disobedience  against  fossil  fuel  mal-­‐  development,  and  that  the  message  of  these  civil  disobedience  campaigns  must  be  globally  focused,  while  explicitly  aimed  at  developing  home-­‐state  domestic  political  will  to:  a)  put  a  global  price  on  carbon  (using  regulation  and  taxes,  not  markets);  b)  raise  ambition  at  the  UN  climate  talks  (i.e.,  raise  the  targets  to  indicate  50  percent  collective  reductions  by  2025  and  95  percent  by  2040);  c)  ramp  up  “additional”  (i.e.  not  already  counted  or  committed)  and  democratically  accountable  public  financing  of  all  the  UNFCCC  climate  3  funds  (Green  Climate  Fund,  Special  Adaptation  Fund,  Loss  and  Damage  Mechanism),  and  d)  transform  intellectual  property  rights  to  drive  sustainable  technology  transfers.  3)  Creating  a  Global  Public  Council  on  Environmental  Economic  Truth  and  Reconciliation  (or  some  such-­‐named  entity)  charged  with  open  and  transparent  evaluation  of  UNFCCC  participation,  publication,  and  public  commentary  produced  by  corporations,  civil  society  and  social  movements,  and  member  state  governments;2  4)  Mobilizing  support  for  and  increasing  the  visibility  of  public  scholarship  in  the  service  of  climate  justice  politics,  by  means  of  critical  analysis  of:  a)  the  power  and  politics  of  the  one  percenters;  i.e.,  elevation  of  class  politics  to  the  front  of  the  environmental/climate  justice  agenda;  b)  carbon  markets  and  state  subsidies  to  fossil  fuel  corporations  and  state  oil  companies;  c)  the  climate  skepticism  industry;  –  for  example,  by  raising  the  example  of  the  Koch  brothers  to  yet  higher  and  more  transparent  visibility  and  using  the  case  to  publicize  the  political  malevolence  of  the  one  percent.  5)  Globalizing  the  university  fossil  fuel  divestment  movement  in  ways  that  recognize  the  need  and  right  of  the  global  South  for  2  For  reference  see  the  efforts  of  EcoEquity  in  this  direction,  their  Climate  Equity  Reference  Calculator,  and  Climate  Equity  Pledge  Scorecard.

Concretely  this  means,  a)  In  the  US,  arguing  for  constant  attack  on  Republican  denialism  and  the  “climate  lies”  industry/funding  apparatus  (again  the  Koch  example);  b)  again,  developing  a  climate  truth  commission/court,  wherein  an  independent  body  investigates  the  claims  of  the  carbon  capitalists  and  traders,  evaluating  the  carbon  markets  and  market-­‐based  solutions  already  instituted  and  or/planned  by  the  UN;  c)  developing  a  left  front  within  climate  justice  politics  unified  against  false  market-­‐based  solutions.  7)  Continuing  to  develop  climate  justice  philosophy,  politics,  and  policy  initiatives  toward  the  horizon  of  global  environmental  and  social  justice,  and  away  from  global  social  and  environmental  apartheid.  Basic  principles  of  Climate  Justice  philosophy  and  politics:  all  people  –  poor  and  rich  –  have  an  equal  right  to  participate  in  climate  politics  at  every  scale,  and  to  share  the  social  wealth  and  security  afforded  by  sustainable  development,  as  dictated  by  the  carbon  budget  afforded  by  the  natural  limits  of  planet  earth,  as  determined  by  agreed  climate  science.  8)  Further  development  of  Climate  Justice  as  cultural  politics  –  this  is  the  ongoing  search  for  and  production  of  new  meanings  and  new  ways  of  making  and  disseminating  meaning;  new  definitions  of  wealth  and  well-­‐being  4  (buen  vivir;  Ubuntu);  new  framings  and  understandings  of  how  human-­‐made  laws  produce  markets  that  compel  both  state  and  private  firms  and  corporations  to  externalize  costs  onto  labor  and  environment;  new  ethics  for  a  new  planet  marked  forever  more  by  climate  change.  5  Introduction  Richard  Widick  and  John  Foran  Power  concedes  nothing  without  demand,  demand  achieves  nothing  without  struggle,  and  this  time,  struggle  will  achieve  nothing  without  conviction  expressed  in  direct  action  civil  disobedience  aimed  at  preventing  carbon  mal-­‐development.  Climate  Deadline  –  Paris  2015.  The  nations  will  adopt  the  next  universal  climate  treaty.  That  treaty  is  now  being  written3  for  presentation  as  a  draft  text  at  the  crucial  South  American  COP  in  Lima,  offering  policy  designs  for  limiting  future  global  average  maximum  atmospheric  warming  to  a  stated  maximum  increase  of  no  more  than  two  degrees  Celsius/3.6  degrees  Fahrenheit  (although  science  tells  us  that  1.5  degrees  would  be  a  lot  less  risky,  and  social  science  tells  us  that  would  be  a  herculean  feat).  But  the  national  contributions  to  the  new  treaty  made  so  far  suffer  from  lack  of  ambition,  indicate  ongoing  policy  deadlock  and  scandalously  deficient  finance  for  adaptation,  and  thus  presage  a  future  more  likely  defined  by  global  average  warming  of  four,  six,  or  even  ten  degrees  Celsius.  Will  the  new  treaty  aiming  at  two  degrees,  but  likely  to  shoot  higher,  determine  a  path  toward  global  climate  apartheid,  further  separating  the  world’s  haves  and  have-­‐nots  3  Read  the  NEGOTIATING  TEXT,  published  by  the  UNFCCC  at  the  conclusion  of  the  Geneva  Climate  Change  Conference  on  February  22,  2015:    ng_text_12022015@2200.pdf  Follow  the  National  Submissions  to  the  New  Treaty  here:    x?showOnlyCurrentCalls=1&populateData=1&expectedsubm  issionfrom=Parties&focalBodies=ADP  ;  Find  the  key  documents  also  archived  and  analyzed  by  the  corporate  group  C2es  here:    issues-­‐submissions-­‐adp-­‐2014.  into  two  great  classes  of  climate  winners  and  losers?  Or  will  it  instead  set  a  course  toward  Climate  Justice  and  a  more  livable  future  for  all  of  the  world’s  children  and  their  children,  and  of  course  the  animal  nations  and  ecologies  on  which  all  people  depend  for  every  kind  of  economic,  cultural,  and  spiritual  sustenance?  This  IICAT  report  compiles  and  presents  a  range  of  strategy  statements,  analysis,  and  documents  from  advocates  for  the  path  toward  justice  and  away  from  climate  apartheid.4  Our  principal  purpose  in  producing  this  report  is  to  address  the  hydra-­‐headed  specter  of  mutually  reinforcing  and  viciously  interconnected  environmental,  economic,  and  politico-­‐military  crises  that  are  haunting  the  globe  and  inflicting  massive  harm  on  populations  everywhere  -­‐-­‐  especially  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable  in  every  country  and  region.  With  the  stakes  so  high,  climate  justice  demands,  on  one  hand,  a  massive  re-­‐making  of  both  domestic  and  global  climate  governance  and  development  policy,  and,  on  the  other,  an  even  more  massive  transformation  of  everyday  life  and  consumption  habits,  especially  in  the  developed  world,  with  a  corresponding  provision  of  the  rights  and  requirements  of  life  for  all  peoples  and  species.  *  *  *  *  4  We  hope  in  the  future  to  expand  this  range  to  include  more  and  diverse  voices,  especially  from  women,  the  global  south,  and  additional  public  sectors  or  interests.  Please  contact  us  with  your  feedback  and  with  any  proposal  that  you  have  for  participation  in  this  open-­‐ended  project.  6  Hitherto  demands  alone  have  not  been  effective.  The  structural  violence  of  today’s  fossil  fuel-­‐  driven  status  quo  against  the  99  percent  indicates  the  time  is  near  when  people  will  begin  taking  whatever  actions  are  necessary.  We  are  entering  the  next  stage  of  the  climate  wars,  as  evidenced,  for  example,  in  the  tar  sands,  fracking,  mountain-­‐top  coal  removal,  and  fossil  fuel  divestment  struggles  of  recent  years  in  North  America.  In  every  case,  defenders  of  these  front  lines  are  fighting  their  own  battles  against  powerful  opponents.  Meanwhile,  in  the  less  industrially  developed  world,  largely  in  the  global  south,  forests  are  cut  down  to  send  beef  to  McDonalds,  workers  are  exploited  to  create  the  plastic  junk  that  fills  the  oceans  and  garbage  dumps  of  the  world,  indigenous  peoples,  peasants,  and  women  and  children  everywhere  see  their  lands  taken.  The  species  experience  degradation  of  their  environments  and  the  wanton  taking  of  their  bodies,  the  rising  seas  encroach  on  the  precious  drinking  water  of  small  island  states,  and  storms  and  droughts  force  populations  out  of  their  homes  into  uncertain  journeys.  These  campaigns  and  tragic  transformations  are  postcards  from  one  possible  and  unhappy  future,  in  which  business  as  usual  pushes  global  warming  over  the  tipping  point  into  runaway  climate  change,  and  desperation  forces  peoples  into  motion,  hopefully  first  of  all  into  the  streets,  as  was  recently  witnessed  at  the  People’s  Climate  Marches  in  New  York  City  and  around  the  world,  and  not  toward  violence.  *  *  *  *  Redistribution  must  become  the  principal  demand  and  strategy  for  climate  justice.  As  you  will  see  in  what  follows,  the  unfolding  climate  crisis  profoundly  expresses  the  inequalities  that  the  modern  world  economic  (culture)  system  has  delivered.  Inequality  between  and  within  nations  has  marched  in  step  with  the  accumulation  of  obscene  profits  and  wealth  in  the  era  of  globalization,  the  origins  of  which  are  roughly  contemporary  with  the  dawning  awareness  of  the  climate  crisis  in  the  late  1980s.  In  1999,  the  three  wealthiest  individuals  in  the  world  controlled  assets  equivalent  to  the  GNPs  of  the  48  poorest  countries  on  the  planet.  Today,  the  world’s  85  richest  individuals  own  more  wealth  than  the  bottom  half  of  the  planet’s  total  population.5  Northern  oil  politics,  militarism,  and  new  forms  of  neo-­‐colonial  state-­‐making  further  maintain  and  deepen  this  grotesque  and  inhumane  inequality  in  today’s  political,  economic,  and  environmental  landscapes  of  struggle,  and  this  must  be  recognized  and  foregrounded  in  climate  justice  politics.  Concentrated  wealth  is  the  principal  weapon  of  the  one  percent.  The  economic  problem  is  one  of  maldistribution,  not  scarcity,  and  justice  requires  redistribution,  and  a  long  overdue  check  on  wealth  and  privilege  in  the  global  North.  Tactically,  the  entrenched  fossil  fuel-­‐inflated  power  of  the  global  one  percent,  their  free  market  fantasies,  and  their  bought  and  paid  for  culture  of  deception  and  deceit  must  be  5  OXFAM  Briefing  Paper  178:  Working  for  the  Few:  Political  Capture  and  Economic  Inequality  (January  20,  2014),  .  7  countered  and  dismantled.  They  are  the  ones  who  every  day  operate  outside  and  above  the  law  to  maintain  their  edge.  Theirs  is  the  politics  of  criminality.  Russian  “capitalism”  is  plutocratic.  China  openly  argues  the  virtues  of  authoritarian  state  capitalism.  US  capitalism  is  in  actuality  more  of  a  nanny-­‐state  socialism  for  the  corporations.  South  Africa  is  a  kind  of  proto-­‐  Stalinist  industrial  experiment.  Welfarist  versions  of  capitalism  barely  persist  in  Scandinavia  and  a  few  other  places.  Meanwhile,  in  the  twenty-­‐year-­‐old  climate  negotiations  held  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  carbon  trading  and  marketized  programs  and  institutions  of  one  variety  or  another  have  come  to  dominate  the  entire  spectrum  of  initiatives  from  climate  finance  to  loss  and  damage,  ever  since  the  grand  deception  perpetrated  by  Al  Gore  at  the  negotiations  for  the  1997  Kyoto  Protocol  first  put  on  the  table  a  basket  of  so-­‐called  “market  solutions.”  Industry  leaders  and  champions  of  this  neoliberalization  of  climate  policy  continue  to  enthusiastically  promote  market  solutions  while  papering  over  concrete  evidence  of  their  failure.  A  simple  look  at  carbon  trading  prices  indicates  that  the  carbon  markets  are  utterly  incapable  of  fulfilling  their  official  mandate  of  putting  a  price  on  carbon  that  would  incentivize  lower  global  emissions  and  stimulate  demand  and  direct  investment  into  renewables.  Climate  Justice:  One  No,  Many  Yeses.  Climate  Justice  advances  a  “great  refusal”  of  the  dominant  myths  guiding  political  economic  activity  in  today’s  world  –  that  endless  growth  is  environmentally  sustainable;  that  the  “capitalisms”  at  work  today  can  reduce  inequality  and  deliver  the  material,  cultural,  and  spiritual  requirements  for  living  well  to  the  whole  world;  or  that  global  ecology  can  be  sustained  as  long  as  the  belief  reigns  that  the  world’s  flora  and  fauna  exist  solely  for  whatever  reckless  purpose  private  interests  can  dream  up.  A  deepened,  more  participatory  democracy  must  therefore  rise  against  the  anarchy  of  what  today  is  reductively  called  capitalism,  but  which  might  better  be  described  as  the  litany  of  economic  arrangements  engineered  according  to  the  arbitrary  rule  of  too  often  morally  bankrupt  authoritarian  states  and  corrupt  pseudo-­‐democracies  that  too-­‐largely  serve  as  the  lap-­‐dogs  of  local,  national,  and  global  capital  formations.  The  appropriate  weapon  to  wield  against  them  is  the  participatory  politics  of  popular  regulation  and  control,  with  the  return  of  collective  faith  in  governance  measured  out  in  proportion  to  the  forced  withdrawal  of  capital  from  the  political  arena  (by  which  we  mean,  for  example,  that  progressive  campaign  finance  reform  in  the  US  is  a  prerequisite  for  reinvestment  of  faith  in  governance  for  and  by  the  people,  not  the  corporations).  Henceforth,  the  climate  justice  movement  should  use  any  and  all  the  tools  at  its  disposal  to  everywhere  oppose  the  planet-­‐killing  twentieth-­‐century  energy  technologies  advanced  by  the  politicians,  financiers,  shareholders,  and  the  apologists  of  carbon-­‐  fueled  mal-­‐development.  It  is  time  for  the  social  movements  to  rise  to  this  occasion  with  conviction,  expressed  first  of  all  in  the  practice  of  direct  action  civil  disobedience  at  the  front  lines  of  planetary  eco-­‐defense,  and,  equally  importantly,  continue  offering  constructive  alternatives  to  the  status  quo,  business-­‐as-­‐usual  economic,  political,  and  8  climate  policies  that  are  driving  the  unfolding  climate  crisis.  Along  these  lines,  as  we  see  it,  the  future  of  Climate  Justice  must  begin  with  an  honest  look  at  the  present  moment.  Toward  that  end,  we  offer  this  report.  9  Is  the  Climate  Justice  Movement  Ready  to  Scale-­‐jump  Our  Politics?  (No,  not  yet  –  but  we’ll  need  to,  sooner  than  later,  with  Latin  American  counterpower)  Patrick  Bond  Global  pessimism  and  local  optimism  have  recently  characterised  Climate  Justice  (CJ)  scale  politics:  paralysis  above,  movement  below.  It  may  be  opportune  to  now  re-­‐assess  global  environmental  governance  as  a  site  of  struggle,  one  that  has  proven  so  frustrating  over  the  past  two  decades.  It  is  time  again  to  ask,  specifically,  can  hundreds  of  successful  episodes  in  which  communities  and  workers  resist  greenhouse-­‐  gas  generation  (“Blockadia”  is  Naomi  Klein’s  term  for  the  newly  liberated  spaces)  or  seed  local  post-­‐carbon  alternatives,  now  accumulate  into  a  power  sufficient  to  shape  climate  negotiations?  My  answer  is,  unfortunately,  not  yet.  We  need  to  become  much  stronger  and  more  coherent  in  rebuilding  the  CJ  movement,  once  so  full  of  hope,  from  2007-­‐09,  but  since  then  in  the  doldrums,  even  though  individual,  mostly  disconnected  activist  initiatives  have  deserved  enormous  admiration,  no  more  so  than  in  the  Americas.  In  Lima,  Peru,  the  twentieth  annual  United  Nations  “Conference  of  the  Polluters”  –  “UN  COP20”  –  comes  on  the  heels  of  two  world  attention-­‐grabbing  policy  events:  a  United  Nations  special  summit  in  September  just  after  a  400,000-­‐strong  Manhattan  people’s  march  and  Wall  Street  blockade,  and  the  Washington-­‐Beijing  emissions-­‐timetable  deal  in  November.  The  COP20  offers  a  chance  to  gauge  the  resulting  balance  of  forces,  especially  in  the  critical  Andean  countries  where  melting  mountain  glaciers  and  shrinking  Amazonian  jungles  meet.  Here,  combinations  of  the  world’s  most  radical  conceptions  of  nature’s  integrity  (“Rights  of  Mother  Earth,”  sumak  kawsay  and  buen  vivir)  combine  with  concrete  struggles  –  some  highly  effective  –  to  transcend  the  destruction  of  nature  or  its  commodification.  In  my  experience,  the  world’s  most  visionary  CJ,  post-­‐capitalist  politics  are  fused  when  Ecuador’s  Acción  Ecologica  eco-­‐feminists  find  indigenous  movement  allies  and  solidarity  activists  across  the  world.  The  Quito  NGO  had  long  explored  the  question  of  the  Global  North’s  “ecological  debt”  to  the  South  and  to  the  planet,  but  it  was  when  oil  drilling  was  proposed  in  the  Yasuni  National  Park  that  the  stakes  were  raised  for  both  Action  Ecologica  and  the  Confederation  of  Indigenous  Nationalities.  They  lost  the  first  rounds  of  the  battle:  first,  shaming  Germany  and  Norway  into  making  payments  to  leave  the  oil  in  the  soil  (a  total  of  $5  billion  was  demanded,  as  a  down  payment  on  the  North’s  climate  debt),  and  second,  once  the  money  was  deemed  insufficient,  a  national  referendum  to  protect  Yasuni  (regardless  of  payments)  was  not  treated  fairly  by  Ecuador’s  extractivist  ruling  class.  That  struggle  and  others  like  it  –  e.g.  Bolivia’s  notorious  proposed  forest  highway,  TIPNIS  –  have  forced  onto  the  progressive  agenda  this  uncomfortable  dilemma:  are  the  “pink”  governments  of  Rafael  Correa  in  Ecuador  and  Evo  Morales  in  Bolivia  –  as  well  as  of  Nicolas  Maduro  in  nearby  Venezuela  –  capable  of  generating  serious  eco-­‐socialist  policies  consistent  with  their  leaders’  rhetoric?  Or  instead,  are  the  new  elites  irretrievably  petro-­‐  Keynesian,  petro-­‐Indigenous  and  petro-­‐  10  Socialist,  respectively,  with  radical  climate  politics  foiled  by  their  economies’  carbon  rentiers?  In  Peru  itself,  the  current  regime  of  Ollanta  Humala  swept  into  power  in  2011  on  a  pinkish  electoral  platform.  Yet  the  mining  sector  has  since  boomed,  with  disastrous  impacts  in  the  highlands  and  Amazon  alike.  Recall  that  in  2009,  the  Awajun  and  Wampis  Peoples  and  the  Interethnic  Association  for  Development  of  the  Peruvian  Jungle  (Aidesep)  blockaded  roads  in  Bagua,  leading  to  a  confrontation  with  the  military  that  left  38  dead  and  200  wounded.  As  Aidesep’s  leader  Alberto  Pizango  put  it,  “Thanks  to  the  Amazonian  mobilizations  I  can  say  that  today  the  indigenous  agenda  is  not  only  inserted  in  the  national  level  and  within  the  State,  but  on  the  international  level.”  Yet  Pizango  and  52  others  are  in  the  midst  of  being  prosecuted  for  that  protest.  And  profiteers  continue  to  apply  pressure.  To  his  credit,  Peruvian  Environment  Minister  Manuel  Pulgar-­‐Vidal  admits  that  thanks  to  the  threat  of  the  “forestry  market  of  carbon,  people  are  losing  trust  and  confidence  around  that  mechanism.  People  are  thinking  that  it  can  create  conditions  to  lose  their  land.”  Still,  Pulgar-­‐Vidal  believes  safeguards  will  be  sufficient.  At  an  Indonesian  forest  debate  in  May,  he  asked,  “What  kind  of  incentives  can  we  create  to  bring  the  business  sectors  to  the  forest?”  He  praised  Unilever  as  “a  good  example  of  how  a  private  sector  [firm]  can  play  a  more  active  role  regarding  the  forest.”  Expressing  faith  in  the  “green  economy,”  Pulgar-­‐Vidal  continued,  “What  we  need  to  do  is  to  address  the  problem  of  the  value  of  the  carbon  bond  around  the  forest.  The  current  prices  are  creating  a  lack  of  interest  …  [and]  disincentives  to  have  the  business  sector  and  the  investor  more  close  to  the  forestry  sector.”  This  sort  of  vulgar-­‐capitalist  COP  hosting  is  not  a  coincidence.  The  four  preceding  COPs,  in  Poland,  Qatar,  South  Africa  and  Mexico,  witnessed  dominant  local  state  actors  co-­‐  presiding  alongside  UN  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  secretary  Christiana  Figueres.  Following  the  power  logic  within  their  national  power  blocs,  they  remained  universally  addicted  to  hydro-­‐  carbon  exploitation,  with  logical  COP  results.  Likewise,  the  UNFCCC  appears  addicted  to  market  mechanisms  as  alleged  solutions  to  climate  chaos,  even  after  the  breakdown  of  the  two  main  carbon  trading  schemes:  in  the  European  Union,  which  suffered  a  90%  price  crash  since  2008,  and  US  where  the  Chicago  Climate  Exchange  (self-­‐interestedly  promoted  by  Al  Gore)  suffered  a  fatal  heart  attack  in  2011.  Nevertheless,  the  UNFCCC  and  World  Bank  express  high  hopes  for  a  new  generation  of  carbon  trading  and  offsets  in  California,  a  few  major  Chinese  cities  and  a  layer  of  middle-­‐sized  economies  including  South  Korea,  Brazil  and  South  Africa.  In  other  words,  ruling-­‐class  personalities  still  shape  global  climate  politics  far  more  than  CJ  activists,  as  witnessed  in  the  futility  with  which  the  latter  have  attempted  to  influence  the  UN’s  Green  Climate  Fund.  Between  the  coal,  oil  and  mining  barons  who  rule  over  recent  COP  hosts  on  the  one  hand,  and  a  former  carbon  trader  (Figueres)  who  rules  the  UNFCCC  on  the  other,  there  has  never  been  any  possibility  for  getting  the  CJ  perspective  a  seat  at  the  global  table.  In  any  case,  each  national  delegation  comes  to  each  COP  with  the  agenda  of  maximizing  11  the  interests  of  its  own  corporations,  which  tend  to  prominently  include  those  with  industrial  or  fossil  fuel  assets  and  the  need  to  emit  more  and  more  gases.  A  Conference  of  Polluters  it  will  remain  until  that  structural  flaw  is  solved.  The  COPs  are  also  stymied  because  the  US  State  Department’s  main  negotiator,  Todd  Stern,  looms  over  the  proceedings  like  a  smug  vulture  during  a  deadly  drought.  Thanks  to  Edward  Snowden’s  revelations  about  Washington’s  surveillance  capacity,  we  recently  learned  how  Stern  and  US  President  Barack  Obama  cheated  their  way  through  the  “Hopenhagen”  climate  summit  in  2009  by  listening  in  on  the  competition’s  cell  phones,  rendering  hopeless  a  genuine  deal  that  would  enforce  emission  cuts.  And  thanks  also  to  Chelsea  Manning  and  WikiLeaks  providing  us  those  250  000  confidential  State  Department  cables,  we  know  that  the  weeks  after  the  Copenhagen  fiasco  were  spent  by  Stern  and  his  colleagues  cajoling,  bullying  and  bribing  so  hard  that  they  purchased  (for  a  lousy  $50  million  in  aid)  even  the  tough-­‐sounding  Maldives  Island  leadership  whose  famous  scuba-­‐gear-­‐  adorned  underwater  cabinet  meeting  stunt  in  late  2009  dramatized  that  sinking  feeling.  As  a  result  of  our  awareness  about  Washington’s  COP  corruption,  might  the  growing  US  climate  activist  community  become  sufficiently  brave  as  to  test  their  budding  civil  disobedience  muscles  neck-­‐  locking  Stern  and  John  Kerry?  Could  they,  for  example,  prevent  the  US  delegates  from  departing  Washington  for  Lima?  (Comrades,  a  timely  blockade  of  the  I-­‐66  highway  and  Dulles  Airport  Access  Road  would  do  the  trick.)  And  please  add  to  that  “no  pasaran”  list  the  COPs’  saboteurs  from  Ottawa,  Canberra  and  Tokyo,  too.  Still,  such  leaders  and  delegations  are  rarely  much  more  than  the  personification  of  the  class  power  wielded  by  leading  fractions  of  capital  over  labour.  It  is  in  a  structural  critique  of  capitalist,  patriarchal,  racist-­‐colonialist  and  anti-­‐ecological  systems  that  we  annually  find  the  COP  elites  sorely  wanting.  Still,  even  if  we  can  conclude  ahead  of  time  that  the  COP20  will  break  even  NGO  reformers’  hearts,  as  have  all  others  since  Kyoto  in  1997,  this  event  is  important.  It  serves  CJ  activists  as  a  platform  for  highlighting  Latin  American  struggles.  It  will  also  nurture  the  flowering  activists  who  went  to  the  CJ-­‐oriented  pre-­‐COP  prep-­‐coms  in  Venezuela  twice  this  year.  And  it  offers  a  warm-­‐up  protest  –  more  fearsome  to  COP  elites  than  tame  Warsaw’s  or  Durban’s,  we  might  safely  predict  –  for  the  “big  one”  in  Paris:  the  COP21.  In  August  this  year,  French-­‐based  activists’  prep  meeting  generated  visions  of  shutting  down  Paris,  and  identifying  a  date  in  early  December  2015  for  a  global  mass  protest  and  closure  of  educational  institutions  as  the  youth  find  their  voices.  One  reason  we  must  continue  investing  political  energies  below  and  condemning  elites  above  –  i.e.,  not  getting  lulled  into  COP-­‐  reformism  –  is  because  more  people  are  asking  the  question  posed  after  Copenhagen  in  relation  to  the  UNFCCC  (as  we  did  at  Seattle  in  relation  to  the  WTO  in  1999):  “fix  it  or  nix  it”?  After  all,  the  World  Bank  and  IMF  are  now  regularly  considered  last-­‐century  institutions  given  their  incapacities,  and  the  US  dollar  is  apparently  being  terminally  weakened  by  the  12  Federal  Reserve’s  printing-­‐press  dilution  and  by  the  coming  liberalized  yuan  trade.  Isn’t  the  UN  also  destined,  as  Tariq  Ali  put  it  after  the  US-­‐UK  2003  Iraq  invasion  was  endorsed  in  the  UN  General  Assembly,  “to  go  the  way  of  the  League  of  Nations”?  The  UNFCCC’s  irrelevance  at  the  time  of  its  greatest  need  and  responsibility  will  be  one  of  our  descendants’  most  confounding  puzzles.  After  Copenhagen,  illusions  promoted  by  stodgy  Climate  Action  Network  member  groups  under  the  slogan  “Seal  the  Deal!”  were  dashed.  As  350.org’s  Bill  McKibben  put  it,  the  presidents  of  the  US,  Brazil,  China,  South  Africa  and  India  (the  latter  four  termed  BASIC)  “wrecked  the  UN”  by  meeting  separately  and  agreeing  to  eventually  make  merely  voluntary  commitments.  Now  add  (Kyoto-­‐reneging)  Russia  to  the  BASICs  and,  as  the  BRICS,  the  economic  agenda  signaled  at  their  Fortaleza,  Brazil  summit  in  July  this  year  boils  down  to  financing  infrastructure  to  ensure  more  rapid  extraction,  climate  be  damned.  Still,  the  insolence  of  the  Obama  Administration  outshines  the  BRICS,  when  cutting  another  exclusive  side  deal  so  soon  before  Lima  and  Paris.  This  month’s  climate  pact  with  China  clarified  to  CJers  how  much  more  pressure  is  needed  from  below  if  we  are  to  maintain  warming  below  the  2  degrees  threshold  (not  the  Obama-­‐Jinping  3+  degrees).  Yet  it  reduces  pressure  to  hammer  out  a  genuinely  binding  global  deal  with  sharp  punishments  for  emissions  violations,  plus  the  needed  annual  climate  debt  payments  of  several  hundred  billion  dollars  from  polluters  to  climate  victims.  As  a  result,  rising  activist  militancy  is  ever  more  vital,  as  the  window  for  making  the  North’s  (and  BRICS’)  massive  emissions  cuts  begins  to  close  tight.  Although  probably  too  optimistic  about  what  can  be  done  at  the  COPs,  John  Foran  is  correct  on  all  the  other  strategies.  For  example,  he  seeks  movement  below,  e.g.  from  the  US-­‐based  Climate  Justice  Alliance,  Global  Climate  Convergence  and  System  Change  Not  Climate  Change  networks  that  did  such  an  impressive  job  radicalizing  the  previously  prevailing  (bland  Avaaz)  discourses  at  the  People’s  Climate  March  in  New  York.  As  miserable  as  the  balance  of  forces  appears  in  Lima,  nevertheless  all  of  us  in  the  CJ  community  have  been  inspired  by  Andean  activists:  by  the  campaign  against  oil  extraction  from  Yasuni,  by  the  $8.6  billion  ecological  debt  battle  against  the  legacy  of  oil  spills  by  Texaco  (now  Chevron)  nearby,  and  by  the  region’s  indigenous  resistance  to  privatized  trees  in  the  form  of  Reducing  Emissions  through  Deforestation  and  forest  Degradation  (REDD).  If  REDD  is  a  chosen  battleground  for  the  most  advanced  Latin  American  activists,  then  the  worry  is  that,  like  the  Cancun  COP16  in  2010,  men  like  Humala  and  Pulgar-­‐Vidal  will  divide  and  rule  civil  society  with  patronage  pay-­‐offs.  The  possibility  of  consolidating  local  initiatives  into  national  and  then  global-­‐scale  struggle  awaits  a  stronger  sense  of  CJ  strategies  to  prevent  cooptation  or  brute  repression.  But  since  the  heady  days  when  1980s-­‐era  IMF  Riots  gave  way  to  mass  social  movement  formations,  to  Zapatismo,  to  Brazil’s  Movement  of  Landless  Workers,  to  leftist  political  parties  and  to  other  manifestations  of  progress,  Latin  Americans  have  been  at  the  vanguard  of  the  world’s  civilizing  forces.  They  –  and  we  –  are  not  strong  enough  to  change  the  balance  of  forces  favouring  climate  injustice  next  month.  But  they  do  usually  signal  the  way  forward.  13  Fear  and  Loathing  of  Carbon  Market  Zombies:  A  Decade  and  Counting  of  Climate  Justice  Agitation  M.  K.  Dorsey,  Joint  Center  for  Political  &  Economic  Studies  SPECIAL  TO  IICAT  –  Lima,  Peru  –  December  2014  -­‐  COP20  As  early  as  2000  European  Union  watchdog  organizations  cautioned  against  utilizing  the  three  market  based  “solutions”  inaugurated  by  the  Kyoto  Protocol—emissions  trading,  joint  implementation  (JI)  and  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).  Referencing  the  troubles  of  carbon  offsetting,  enshrined  in  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  more  than  a  decade  ago,  the  critics  further  admonished:  The  hypothesis  that  such  a  scheme  [as  the  clean  development  mechanism]  will  be  efficient  on  the  international  level  is  also  flawed.  One  must  not  forget  the  absolute  impossibility  of  monitoring  emissions  from  millions  of  sources  spread  all  over  the  world,  not  to  mention  the  lack  of  a  binding  regulatory  system  to  enforce  emissions  limits.6  Representatives  from  the  global  south  were  even  more  bearish,  to  couch  it  in  market  terms.  The  Delhi  based  Centre  for  Science  and  the  Environment  affirmed,  “The  rush  to  make  profits  out  of  carbon-­‐fixing  engenders  another  kind  of  colonialism.”  Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  an  emergent  late  20th  century  class  of  would-­‐be  scholar-­‐investors  6  Corporate  Europe  Observatory  (CEO).

Amsterdam,  The  Netherlands.  preempted  the  critics  two  years  earlier,  opining  that  “implementation  of  activities  [like  offsetting]  aimed  to  mitigate  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is  more  cost-­‐  efficient  in  developing  countries  than  in  most  of  the  industrialized  world.”7  This  is  a  crucial  moment  for  the  planet  and  social  movements.  After  nearly  two  decades  of  persistent,  catastrophic  carbon  market  failures,  and  on  the  eve  of  the  2015  Paris  round  of  multilateral  climate  talks,  the  EU-­‐ETS  is  a  zombie  of  its  once  beleaguered  self.  The  zombie-­‐like  status  of  the  EU-­‐ETS  should  not  be  taken  lightly,  nor  as  hyperbole.  7  Dutschke,  M.  and  A.  Michaelowa.  (1998).

The  rise  of  the  scholar-­‐investor  (or  scientist-­‐investor)  is  by  no  means  rare  in  the  scientific-­‐capitalist  driven  circuitries  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC).  “Scientists”  (although  not  officially  called  “scientist-­‐investors”  or  “scholar-­‐investors”)  are  given  special  access  as  an  officially  designated  “stakeholder”  class  at  UNFCCC  negotiations.  The  “scientist”  category,  let  alone  the  amalgam  of  “scientist-­‐investors”  or  “scholar-­‐investor”  is  an  under-­‐studyied  formation.  Some  (many?)  UNFCCC  registered  “scientists”  are  also  known  to  have  investment  or  capital  accumulation  stakes  in  myriad  aspects  of  the  UNFCCC  outcomes—including  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  projects.  This  is  true  of  Michael  Dutschke  and  Axel  Michaelowa,  cited  above.  Prior  to  serving  as  an  IPCCC,  Working  Group  III  “Lead  author”  (which  subsequently  resulted  in  his  co-­‐receipt  of  the  Nobel  prize  with  other  IPCCC  lead  authors)  Dutschke  was  an  “Auditor”  forTUV-­‐SUD  one  of  the  three  largest  validator-­‐verifiers  of  Clean  Development  Mechanism  Projects.  Similarly  Michaelowa,  between  1997-­‐  2000,  served  on  the  advisory  board  of  the  World  Bank’s  AIJ-­‐  Programme—the  pilot  programme  for  CDM/JI  investments.  What  is  notably  missing  from  many  of  the  “scholarly”  contribution  of  these  authors  (and  others)  are  disclosures  of  their  affiliations,  especially  where  they  have  financial  interest  or  stand  to  gain  financially.  To  be  clear,  the  authors  herein,  do  not,  for  one  second  believe  in  the  empty  rants  or  claims  of  those  denying  the  existence  of  climate  change.  On  the  contrary  we  believe  climate  change  is  indeed  upon  us,  and  for  a  variety  of  scientific  reasons,  maybe  be  unfolding  in  ways  that  are  heretofore  unstoppable.  We  do  believe  that  “scientists”  with  investment  (or  professional)  interests  in  the  outcomes  must  disclose  such  ties.  14  Johannes  Teyssen,  chief  executive  of  Eon,  the  German  energy  group  that  is  one  of  Europe’s  largest,  firmly  told  an  EU  Commission-­‐  organized  meeting  of  carbon  market  stakeholders  in  Brussels:  “Let’s  talk  real.  The  ETS  is  bust,  it’s  dead.”  Teyssen  added,  “I  don't  know  a  single  person  in  the  world  that  would  invest  a  dime  based  on  the  ETS  [price]  signals.”8  Just  as  the  UN’s  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  announced  its  7000th  project  in  2013,  market  watchers  observed  a  new  problem,  the  rise  of  “zombie”  projects.  Speaking  to  Reuters  Stefan  Winter,  deputy  head  of  certification  at  the  CDM  auditing  company  Tuv  Nord  described  the  rise  of  “zombie”  carbon  projects,  or  those  in  which  the  company  is  “unable  to  contact  the  clients  by  phone  or  email.”  In  2013  TUV  counted  150  such  projects.  Alexandre  Kossoy,  a  senior  financial  specialist  within  the  World  Bank’s  Carbon  Finance  Unit,  told  Reuters  matter-­‐of-­‐  factly:  “It’s  not  surprising.  We  knew  about  it  but  …  we  haven’t  measured  how  many  because  it  would  take  months  to  go  project  by  project.”  No  wonder  then  that  a  thing  that  seems  to  carry  on  everyday  functions,  as  the  EU-­‐ETS  does,  but  is  simultaneously  considered  or  known  to  be  dead—or  at  least  staffed  by  unknown  and  unreachable  individuals—by  some  of  the  largest  investors  and  actors  in  the  EUETS  space,  seems  apt  for  zombie  classification.  8  See  “How  do  we  seize  opportunities  of  the  transition  to  a  low  carbonenergy  system,  while  avoiding  pitfalls  on  the  way?”  2012.

After  the  collapse  of  the  Durban  round  of  multilateral  climate  talks  the  Financial  Times  reported  in  February  2012,  “The  [EU-­‐ETS]  market  has  suffered  other  indignities  in  its  brief  history,  from  value  added  tax  frauds  worth  billions  of  euros  to  the  cybertheft  of  millions  of  permits  from  companies’  electronic  accounts.  But,  because  it  calls  into  question  the  fundamental  workings  of  the  market  itself,  the  price  slide  may  be  its  most  serious  affliction.”9  While  the  EU-­‐ETS  has  collapsed,  European  investors  seem  to  be  on  a  proverbial  hunt  for  later-­‐day-­‐investor  souls—both  in  Europe  and  abroad.  Perhaps  the  most  disturbing  example  of  the  hunt  for  living  by  proverbial  carbon  market  zombies  comes  from  finance  capital’s  efforts  across  Africa.  For  over  a  half  decade  the  Africa  Carbon  Forum,  in  particular,  has  been  the  go-­‐to-­‐place  where  cadres  of  predominantly  European  investors,  buttressed  by  multilateral  agencies,  actively  hunt  for  African  counterparts  to  invest  and  participate  in  a  space  that  some  of  the  very  same  investors  and  organizers  have  firmly  pronounced  dead.  As  the  UN  describes  it,  the  Africa  Carbon  Forum  seeks  “to  support  Africa’s  participation  in  global  carbon  markets  and  catalyze  green  investment  opportunities.”  These  are  the  crude,  perhaps  ruthless  political  economic  forces  of  multilateral  climate  policy  run  wild,  drawing  institutions,  civil  servants  and  even  civil  society  sympathizers  from  the  global  south  generally  and  Africa  in  particular  into  “dead”  markets—after  the  fact,  and  simultaneously  into  the  science-­‐investor-­‐economists’  upheld  myths  that  emissions  trading  can  appropriately  address  the  present  and  future  9  Chaffin,  Joshua.  2012.  “Emissions  trading:  Cheap  and  dirty.

Alas,  zombie  markets  are  steeped  in  cultish  praise  or  official  multilateral  agency  endorsements—pending  your  vantage;  they  are  also  aggressively  resisted  by  civil  society  movements,  scrutinized  by  regulators  and  increasingly  simply  ignored  by  finance  capital,  media  and  growing  numbers  of  large  institutions.  After  Neoliberal  Necromancy  Proponents  of  the  establishment  of  global  carbon  markets  argue  such  markets  can  and  should  play  a  role  in  reducing  carbon  emissions  to  the  degree  necessary  to  stave  off  the  harmful  effects  those  emissions  are  having  on  the  global  climate  and  vulnerable  communities  across  the  globe.10  Complicating  matters  further,  global  carbon  market  proponents  also  expect  carbon  markets  to  be  key  instruments  capable  of  addressing  and  solving  complex  environmental  and  economic  problems-­‐-­‐simultaneously.11  In  effect  the  carbon  market  is  charged  (or  burdened)  with  the  dual  mission  of  assisting  developing  nations  to  establish  sustainable  economies  10  Aldy,  J.

In  its  idealized  neoliberal  capitalist  form,  the  global  carbon  market  that  some  interlocutors  desire  exists  at  a  transcendental  level,  and  operates  without  workers  and  without  geographic  location.  Jos  Delbeke,  the  European  Commission,  Director  General  for  Climate  Action,  describes  the  role  of  the  state:  ‘Our  role  is  to  keep  the  regulatory  structure  as  simple  as  possible  and  let  the  market  play.’  Such  desires-­‐as-­‐edicts  ignore  the  realities  that  define  markets  at  various  local  to  global  scales.  Carbon  market  advocates  variously  seek  to  create  a  global  market  system  that  is  structured  to  privatize  investment  returns,  while  socializing  risks,  and  have  it  be  subject  to  minimal,  if  any,  governmental  regulation  of  labor,  finance,  and  trade.12  There  is,  however,  within  both  trading  schemes  and  offset  projects  a  significant  gap  between  the  desires  of  traders  and  what  is  currently  happening  with  regard  to  the  development  of  policies  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  University  of  Cambridge  economist  Michael  Grubb  observes:  Having  created  a  market-­‐based  mechanism  to  cut  carbon  a  lot  of  people  seem  to  expect  it  to  behave  in  a  non-­‐market  way  and  deliver  poverty  alleviation,  deliver  sustainable  development  co-­‐benefits.  But  fundamentally,  you  create  a  market,  it’s  12  Harvey,  D.  (1993).  ""The  Nature  of  Environment:  The  Dialectics  of  Social  and  Environmental  Change.""

This  is  especially  strong  at  the  local  level  where  communities  are  resisting  national  reforms  imposed  by  government  elites  and  global  institutions  such  as  the  World  Bank.  Beyond  hegemonic  ideals,  proponents  of  a  global  carbon  market  have  turned  time  and  again  to  the  structure  and  (dys)function  of  the  EU-­‐ETS,  which  has  been  pedestalized  by  the  global  market  proponents,  inter  alia.  A  key  question  is:  How  does  one  move  beyond  the  abstract  discussion  about  markets,  specifically  the  EU-­‐ETS,  to  better  understand  market  (dys)function  in  a  political  economic  context?  Careful  examination  of  the  EU-­‐ETS  reveals  that  this  market  is  a  series  of  markets  operating  in  various  geographical  and  13  See:  .  14  Harvey,  D.  (2006).

Pointcarbon  News  economic  scales.  It  is  remarkably  small  and  is  controlled  by  a  small  number  of  players  with  little  competition  among  them  to  be  found.  A  very  small  number  of  market  actors  control  very  large  portions  of  overall  market  activity,  in  dollar  terms  and/or  in  terms  of  credit  allocation.  Over  a  decade  this  oligonomic  configuration  –a  universe  of  few  buyers  and  sellers  that  make  markets  amongst  themselves—  has  had  tremendously  deleterious  effects  on  overall  competition  in  the  market.  Moreover,  despite  an  expectation  that  the  market  would  be  organized  and  interconnected  with  the  actors  working  in  concert  to  assure  market  efficiencies,  the  EU-­‐ETS  actors  involved  tend  to  be  working  in  completely  different  spheres  and  scales,  with  some  projects  being  funded  through  private  financing,  some  being  funded  through  state  support  and  some  finding  their  financial  support  through  institutional  investors,  and  even  via  elaborate  market  schemes  to  consumers  in  “voluntary”  markets,  with  all  of  the  “market”  working  across  a  landscape  of  different  national  rules  and  uneven  and  differential  state  rules  (e.g.  China).  This  cacophony  of  carbon  market  investors,  wrapped  in  nested  oligonomies  with  little  to  no  regulatory  oversight,  is  crisis  prone,  liquidity  seeking  and  critically  not  serving  its  intended  mandates  of  “combat[ing]  climate  change”  and  “reducing  industrial  greenhouse  gas  emissions  cost-­‐effectively.”  In  the  present  configuration  carbon  markets  aid  and  abet  climate  catastrophe  and  help  fester  new,  unanticipated  ills.  Even  relatively  staid  organizations  like  the  International  Energy  Agency  (IEA)  have  argued  that  for  large  structural  changes  in  energy  production,  like  preventing  new  coal-­‐fired  power  stations  from  being  built,  Europe  needs  to  seek  options  beyond  its  carbon  market.  IEA  17  analysts  believe  the  EU-­‐ETS  cannot  facilitate  the  end  of  coal  within  a  decade.16  Resistance  is  Fertile  It  is  little  wonder  then  that  many  activists  and  observers  have  dubbed  the  whole  carbon  market  effort  a  “false  solution.”  Over  the  decade  arc  way  many  organizations  across  a  multitude  of  spaces  and  venues  have  arisen  to  articulate  civil  society  resistance  to  zombie  carbon  markets  on  the  grounds  that  markets  neither  reduce  emissions,  nor  deliver  climate  justice—but  indeed  exacerbate  injustice.  In  regional  contexts  like  California,  for  example,  communities  have  actively  resisted  the  creation  of  the  market  provisions  in  general  and  the  cap  and  trade  system  specifically  promulgated  by  the  California  Global  Warming  Solutions  Act  of  2006.  One  group,  aptly  named:  A.I.R  or  the  Association  of  Irritated  Residents,  filed  suit  against  the  California  Air  Resources  Board  (ARB).  While  A.I.R.  ultimately  lost,  the  San  Francisco  Superior  Court  did  issue  a  temporary  injunction  preventing  the  ARB  from  conducting  any  further  work  on  its  cap-­‐and-­‐  trade  program.  2014  marked  the  10th  anniversary  of  the  Durban  Group  for  Climate  Justice  –“an  international  network  of  independent  organizations,  individuals  and  people's  movements  who  reject  the  approach  to  climate  change  promoted  by  polluting  corporations,  financiers,  northern  governments  and  economists.”  Since  its  2004  inception  the  Durban  Group  has  been  a  16  Carr,  M.  and  S.

As  I’ve  argued  elsewhere:  “The  demands  for  climate  justice  are  thus  a  subset  of  a  wider  set  of  discussions  and  demands  for  environmental  justice.  These  demands  are  not  just  positions  against  authority,  anti-­‐  positions  ‘‘against  power,’’  per  se.  To  the  contrary,  the  demand  for  climate  justice  is  an  expression  of  hope—indeed,  desire  and  love—and  a  demand  for  objectives  rooted  in  collective  decision-­‐making  that  are  well  beyond  the  provisional  scope  of  power  as  presently  conceived.  The  climate  justice  movement  is  therefore  one  of  liberation  as  well  as  economic  and  ideological  sovereignty.  Prophetically,  the  struggle  for  climate  justice  dares  to  demand  changing  the  world  without  reproducing  hierarchical  state  or  market  power  as  it  is  currently  known.  In  this  way,  it  holds  both  a  threat  against  hegemonic  doxa  and  a  novel  promise  of  liberation.”17  17  See:  Dorsey,  M.  2007.

Re-­‐Imagining  Radical  Climate  Justice  John  Foran  Note  to  readers:  if  you  want  to  skip  the  discussion  of  the  climate  crisis  itself,  feel  free  to  leap  ahead  in  this  essay  to  the  point  where  you  want  to  start!  Introduction  The  science  is  in:  climate  change  is  here  now,  not  in  the  future,18  and  it  is  already  having  devastating  effects  on  people’s  lives.19  That’s  the  bad  news.  Even  worse,  the  massive  social,  economic,  and  political  inequalities  already  generated  by  neoliberal  capitalism  would  seem  to  set  the  social  and  natural  worlds  on  a  collision  course  which  global  elites  cannot  win  even  on  their  own  terms  without  destroying  the  basis  for  all  human  life.  To  put  it  bluntly,  the  climate  crisis  is  perilous,  our  500  year-­‐old  economic  system  cannot  see  us  through  it  safely,  the  window  for  resolving  this  dilemma  is  closing,  and  the  forces  arrayed  against  us  are  strong,  very  strong.

Field  et  al.  (Cambridge:  Cambridge  University  Press,  2014),      d.pdf  The  good  news  is  that  there’s  a  global  climate  justice  movement  which  is  growing  in  numbers,  reach,  strength,  and  inventiveness.  This  movement  is  impossible  to  encompass  easily,  because  it  consists  of  literally  thousands  of  organizations  at  every  scale  –  community,  city,  bio/region,  nation,  and  global  –  interlinked  in  a  vast  network  of  networks.20  This  essay  will  trace  some  of  its  activities,  asking  where  the  major  points  of  impact  lie  at  the  moment,  and  what  strategic  decisions  must  be  faced  moving  forward.  The  global  climate  justice  movement  is  growing  steadily,  but  it  is  still  far  too  weak  to  win  –  at  least  for  the  moment.  Yet  without  such  a  movement,  we  are  literally  cooked.  Climate  justice  forces  knows  this,  and  stopping  the  elites  from  destroying  humanity’s  future  prospects  is  their  agenda.  It  should  also  be  the  agenda  of  every  activist  and  concerned  citizen  on  the  planet.  The  twelve  months  between  the  December  2014  Lima  COP  20,  and  the  fateful  COP  21  in  Paris  at  the  end  of  2015  must  be  the  year  that  we  scale  up  our  efforts  toward  the  end  of  mounting  irresistible  pressure  of  all  kinds  on  our  governments  and  on  the  corporations,  banks,  and  all  the  other  institutions  of  neoliberal  capitalism  that  they  serve,  forcing  them  to  take  the  decisive  steps  we  all  need  and  want,  such  as  adoption  of  a  fair  and  binding  global  climate  treaty  that  will  set  a  course  for  sustainable  post-­‐capitalist  societies  free  of  structured  violence  and  run  democratically  by  the  ninety-­‐nine  percent.  20  Paul  Hawken  makes  the  claim  that  the  movement  organizations  number  in  the  thousands:  Blessed  Unrest:  How  the  Largest  Movement  in  the  World  Came  into  Being  and  Why  No  One  Saw  It  Coming  (New  York:  Viking,  2007).  For  a  partial,  annotated  list  of  some  of  the  key  climate  justice  movements  and  resources  of  which  I  am  aware,  see  “The  Global  Justice  Movement  On-­‐line”  at    19  To  achieve  these  ends,  we  will  need  to  assemble  the  greatest  social  movement  the  world  has  ever.  An  Earth  in  Crisis  The  present  moment  and  the  foreseeable  future  are  defined  by  a  triple  crisis,  consisting  of  n economic  precariousness  and  increasingly  unequal  access  to  well-­‐being  (el  buen  vivir21)  in  the  age  of  neoliberal  capitalist  globalization  and  profound  economic  crisis;  n despite  this,  and  indeed  because  of  it,  there  has  been  a  corresponding  waning  of  public  confidence  in  political  institutions  (the  “democratic  deficit”);  n and  cultures  where  endemic  violence  is  embedded  in  everyday  life,  from  sexual  assault  to  militarism  and  global  warfare.  These  are  now  bound  together  and  exacerbated  by  the  worst  crisis  of  all,  the  wild  card  of  climate  chaos.  And  all  of  this  would  seem  to  auger  a  perfect  storm  of  crisis.22  21  Buen  vivir  (literally,  “living  well”),  in  its  largest  sense  means  living  in  harmony  with  other  people  and  nature,  and  is  often  contrasted  with  the  neoliberal  notion  of  consuming  more  to  live  better.  This  Quechua  and  Aymara  indigenous  concept  has  been  inscribed  in  the  Ecuadoran  constitution.  22  Even  the  climate  science  community  is  starting  to  realize  that  the  natural  sciences  cannot  by  themselves  tell  us  how  to  reduce  emissions.  That  this  is  an  eminently  political  and  economic  issue  is  suggested  by  the  observation  that  “The  scenarios  presented  here  underscore  the  perils  of  global  pathways  that  enable  diverse  stressors  –  cultural  polarization,  geopolitical  fissures,  environmental  degradation,  persistent  poverty,  and  economic  instability  –  to  reinforce  and  amplify  each  other”:  Paul  D.  Raskin,  “Global  Scenarios:  Background  Review  for  the  Millennium  Ecosystem  Assessment.”  Ecosystems  8  (2005):  133–42,  ,  page  141,  cited  by  in  Fiacha  O’Dowda,  “Future  in  the  Anthropocene:  An  Inquiry  into  Relationships  between  Climate  and  Society  in  Global  Future  This  triple  crisis  makes  climate  change  a  “wicked”  problem,  defined  as  one  that  is  difficult  or  impossible  to  solve  because  of  incomplete,  contradictory,  and  changing  requirements  that  are  often  difficult  to  recognize.  The  term  “wicked”  is  used  to  denote  resistance  to  resolution,  rather  than  evil.  Moreover,  because  of  complex  interdependencies,  the  effort  to  solve  one  aspect  of  a  wicked  problem  may  reveal  or  create  other  problems….  Classic  examples  of  wicked  problems  include  economic,  environmental,  and  political  issues.  A  problem  whose  solution  requires  a  great  number  of  people  to  change  their  mindsets  and  behavior  is  likely  to  be  a  wicked  problem.23  For  Kelly  Levin  and  her  colleagues,  most  social  problems  are  wicked  in  the  above  sense.  Climate  change,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  super  wicked  problem,  characterized  by  four  features:  1)  time  is  running  out,  2)  those  seeking  to  end  the  problem  (humans,  and  more  precisely,  global  elites)  are  also  causing  it,  3)  it  is  a  global  collective  action  problem  overseen  by  at  best  a  weak  central  authority  (as  anyone  who  has  ever  witnessed  a  U.N.  Scenarios  and  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  in  Climate  Change,”  M.A.  thesis,  Erasmus  Mundus  (August  2014),  16.  O’Dowda’s  thesis  breaks  new  ground  in  our  understanding  of  the  limitations  of  the  IPCC’s  efforts  to  bring  a  social  scientific  perspective  into  its  modeling.  To  be  sure,  future  scenarios  are  meaningless  without  taking  into  account  their  economic,  political,  social,  and  cultural  dimensions;  the  question  is  how  best  to  do  so.  23  The  Australian  Public  Service  Commission,  “Tackling  Wicked  Problems:  A  Public  Policy  Perspective”  (October  25,  2007).  The  term  apparently  originated  in  social  planning,  and  was  first  introduced  by  Horst  Rittel  and  Melvin  Webber  in  their  1973  article  “Dilemmas  in  a  General  Theory  of  Planning,”  Policy  Sciences  4:  155–169.  20  climate  summit  can  attest).  This  leads  to  the  fourth  obstacle:  Partly  as  a  result  of  the  above  three  features,  super  wicked  problems  generate  a  situation  in  which  the  public  and  decision  makers,  even  in  the  face  of  overwhelming  evidence  of  the  risks  of  significant  or  even  catastrophic  impacts  from  inaction,  make  decisions  that  disregard  this  information  and  reflect  very  short  time  horizons.  It  is  this  very  feature  that  has  frustrated  so  many  climate  policy  advocates.  This  phenomenon  is  analogous  to  smokers  who,  while  they  know  the  high  probability  of  significant  health  problems  and  even  death,  make  a  decision  to  smoke  based  on  immediate  gratification.  This  characteristic  is  especially  pernicious  because  although  it  is  known  that  negative  effects  will  occur  (such  as  respiration  challenges  for  the  smoker)  and  that  there  is  a  high  risk  of  catastrophic  events  (such  as  a  heart  attack  or  lung  cancer),  the  precise  consequences  are  never  certain  for  any  one  individual.24  The  interdependency  of  the  several  crises  besetting  us  is  significant;  it  means  that  holism  is  needed  in  confronting  the  climate  crisis,  and  that  the  many  intersecting  struggles  that  call  for  justice  must  somehow  be  approached  together.  The  upside  of  dealing  with  such  a  complex  crisis  is  that  making  progress  in  any  sphere  of  it  can  24  Kelly  Levin,  Benjamin  Cashore,  Steven  Bernstein  and  Graeme  Auld,  “Overcoming  the  Tragedy  of  Super  Wicked  Problems:  Constraining  our  Future  Selves  to  Ameliorate  Global  Climate  Change,”  Policy  Sciences  45  (2)  (June  2012):  123-­‐152.  change  the  equation  for  the  better  in  others,  and  that  synergies  among  movements  can  emerge  when  they  form  strong  alliances.  In  December  2015,  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  [UNFCCC]  convenes  the  COP  21  meetings  (the  Conference  of  the  Parties,  in  this  case  the  twenty-­‐first  annual  U.N.  climate  summit)  in  Paris  to  finalize  the  global  climate  treaty  it  has  been  working  on  for  several  years.  The  goal  is  to  find  ways  to  prevent  earth  from  warming  more  than  two  degrees  Celsius  since  1800.  This  target  was  set  by  climate  scientists  more  than  a  decade  ago  and  agreed  by  the  governments  of  the  world  at  COP  15  in  Copenhagen  in  2009  to  be  a  threshold  which  must  be  respected:  passing  it  will  likely  plunge  humanity  into  increasingly  unlivable  conditions  (it  is  now  increasingly  realized  that  the  even  more  difficult  target  of  1.5  degrees  Celsius  should  be  the  Rubicon  that  must  not  be  passed).25  The  treaty  under  negotiation  may  therefore  represent  one  of  the  last  best  chances  to  contain  the  disruptive  climate  change  that  is  coming  our  way  and  to  preserve  some  dignity  for  individuals  and  societies.  Every  year  that  passes  without  action  closes  the  vise  more  tightly  on  efforts  to  avert  these  scenarios.  But  for  years  now  at  the  COP,  a  protracted  stalemate  has  been  playing  out,  aptly  characterized  by  the  subtitle  of  a  book  by  activist  scholar  Patrick  Bond,  published  when  COP  17  came  to  his  home  town  of  Durban  in  25  The  gravity  of  the  situation  is  well  sketched  out  in  Kevin  Anderson  “Climate  Change  Going  Beyond  Dangerous  –  Brutal  Numbers  and  Tenuous  Hope,”  What  Next?

Humanity’s  future,  then,  looks  increasingly  set  to  be  a  race.  In  lane  one  stand  the  corporations  and  nation  state  driving  climate  change  and  its  effects  to  the  limit.  In  lane  two  stand  the  climate  justice  movement  and  its  nation-­‐state  and  popular  allies  who  seek  to  check  those  effects,  halt  the  rate  of  increase  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  that  cause  global  warming,  and  then  rapidly  reverse  the  trend  downward.  They  try  to  do  this  through  a  variety  of  means:  defeating  the  economic  and  political  one  percent  at  the  ballot  box,  in  the  streets,  at  places  of  work  and  consumption,  and  in  the  very  carbon-­‐  saturated  culture  and  media  in  which  we  live,  work,  and  dream.  Two  Observations  I’d  like  to  make  two  observations,  which  are  not  self-­‐evident  and  which  may  challenge  9  Patrick  Bond,  Politics  of  Climate  Justice:  Paralysis  Above,  Movement  Below  (Durban:  University  of  KwaZulu  Natal  Press,  2012).  27  See  the  “Open  letter  calling  for  rules  to  protect  the  integrity  of  climate  policy-­‐making  from  vested  corporate  interests”  (November  21,  2013)  signed  by  dozens  of  climate  organizations  at  the  Warsaw  COP  19:    protect-­‐integrity-­‐climate-­‐policy-­‐making-­‐vested-­‐corporate-­‐  interests.  some  readers’  assumptions  and  understandings:  1)  the  climate  crisis  is  far  more  profound  and  daunting  than  most  of  us  realize;  and  2)  the  planet  cannot  stay  below  the  bottom-­‐line  warming  target  of  2  degrees  (let  alone  1.5  degrees)  Celsius  under  capitalism  as  we  know  it.  Let’s  take  a  brief  look  at  each  of  these  claims.  The  climate  crisis  is  far  more  profound  and  daunting  than  most  of  us  realize  We  are  surrounded  by  bad  climate  news,  whether  it’s  extreme  weather  events  of  all  kinds  or  the  latest  scientific  reports.  Given  this,  one  suspects  that  things  are  worse  than  even  those  of  us  who  follow  all  of  this  know.  Indeed  the  global  scientific  community  and  the  UNFCCC  itself  have  an  inkling  of  this:  “[T]hese  days,  it  is  what  we  don’t  know  that  is  the  most  worrying  –  because  you  can’t  properly  prepare  for  what  you  can’t  foresee.”28  In  his  powerful  essay,  “Global  Warming’s  Terrifying  New  Math,”  prominent  U.S.  climate  activist  Bill  McKibben  argues  that  to  have  a  reasonable  chance  to  stay  under  a  two-­‐  degrees  Celsius  temperature  rise  in  this  century,  we  can  only  burn  a  given  amount  of  fossil  fuels  (as  he  points  out,  in  this  case,  “reasonable”  means  four  chances  in  five,  or  “somewhat  worse  odds  than  playing  Russian  roulette  with  a  six-­‐shooter”).  The  science  tells  us  that  this  means  the  world’s  largest  fossil-­‐fuel  producing  corporations  and  countries  must  be  compelled  to  leave  80  percent  of  their  proven  reserves  (and  thus  their  actual  value)  in  the  ground.  This  is  the  28  This  quote  is  found  in  O’Dowda,  “Future  in  the  Anthropocene,”  12-­‐13,  citing  “The  Science,”  accessed  July  20,  2014,    6064.php  22  inescapable  physical  logic  of  salvaging  a  livable  planet  for  future  generations.29  In  2012,  at  the  time  of  writing,  McKibben  estimated  the  cap  for  maximum  atmospheric  CO2  emissions  at  565  gigatons  as  the  upper  limit  for  staying  at  or  below  a  2  degrees  Celsius  temperature  rise.  With  annual  global  emissions  currently  running  around  34  gigatons  a  year,  and  rising  about  three  percent  per  annum,  this  cap  is  roughly  equal  to  a  fourteen-­‐year  supply  –  till  about  2026  –  if  “business  as  usual”  trends  of  economic  production  and  growth  continue.30  The  terrifying  part,  of  course,  is  that  the  estimate  that  the  world’s  already  proven  reserves  of  fossil  fuels  exceeds  McKibben’s  cap  by  five  times.  In  other  words,  the  richest  corporations  in  the  history  of  the  world  would  have  to  forego  four-­‐fifths  of  their  future  earnings  –  by  some  estimates,  an  astronomical  $20  trillion.31  But  instead,  they  are  currently  spending  over  $600  billion  a  year  trying  to  discover  new  sources  of  fossil  fuels  –  fracking,  tar  sands,  deep-­‐water  drilling,  Arctic  oil,  mountain-­‐top  removal  –  while  each  year  the  amount  we  can  afford  to  burn  decreases.

According  to  these  assumptions,  we  have  roughly  twenty  years  left  of  business  as  usual  before  we  exceed  the  limit  (but  now  put  two  bullets  in  the  gun  while  playing  Russian  roulette  with  the  planet).  What  makes  Anderson  and  Bows  true  heroes  within  the  climate  science  community,  however,  is  their  bold  articulation  of  the  policy  implications  of  our  predicament.  They  argue  that  we  need  to  avoid  4  degrees  at  all  cost  (as  even  the  World  Bank  now  agrees),34  and  that  the  global  North  needs  to  cut  70  percent  of  its  emissions  over  the  next  decade.

In  other  words,  just  how  do  we  keep  warming  in  the  1.5-­‐2  degree  range,  with  the  might  of  the  world’s  largest  corporations  and  richest  governments  united  in  suicidal  lockstep  against  us?  The  planet  cannot  stay  below  2  degrees  Celsius  under  capitalism  as  we  know  it  Here  we  come  to  the  economic  bedrock  of  the  current  situation  named  by  Naomi  Klein  in  the  title  of  her  important  new  book:  This  Changes  Everything:  Capitalism  vs.  the  Climate.37  Neoliberal  capitalism  is  undergoing  multiple  crises,  mostly  the  effects  35  Renfrey  Clarke,  “The  New  Revolutionaries:  Climate  Scientists  Demand  Radical  Change”  (January  9,  2014),    scientists-­‐become-­‐revolutionaries/  36  Anderson  is  quoted  in  Stephen  Leahy,  “South  Scores  11th-­‐  Hour  Win  on  Climate  Loss  and  Damage”(November  2013),    climate-­‐loss-­‐and-­‐damage/  37  Naomi  Klein,  This  Changes  Everything:  Capitalism  vs.  the  Climate  (New  York:  Simon  and  Schuster,  2014).  A  pdf  of  the  book  can  be  found  here.  I  have  reviewed  it  here:  “Reflections  on  Naomi  Klein’s  ‘This  Changes  Everything’”  (November  30,  2014),    naomi-­‐kleins-­‐changes-­‐everything/  of  its  “normal”  operations.  In  the  last  twenty  years,  the  rampant  privatization  of  public  goods  and  services  have  generated  obscene  inequality  and  unparalleled  concentrations  of  wealth  and  power:  while  just  90  corporations  and  fossil-­‐fuel  exporting  countries  are  responsible  for  fully  two-­‐thirds  of  all  the  carbon  emissions  discharged  since  the  dawn  of  the  industrial  revolution,  so  the  richest  85  individuals  in  the  world  now  possess  as  much  wealth  as  the  poorest  half  of  humanity  –  3.5  billion  people.38  To  this  we  may  add  what  Rob  Nixon  refers  to  as  the  “slow  violence”  of  resource  depletion  and  the  violence  and  militarism  that  accompany  the  attempt  of  the  United  States  to  secure  its  primacy  in  the  world  system  by  massive  spending  to  fight  wars  and  maintain  military  bases  that  give  it  the  capacity  to  do  so  all  over  the  world.  Combined,  and  with  climate  change  now  in  the  ascendant,  these  look  like  the  ultimate,  irresolvable  (whether  on  capitalism’s  terms,  or  in  terms  of  a  livable  future)  final  contradictions  of  capitalism.  Because  its  economic  logic  is  based  on  literally  endless  growth,  which  requires  ever-­‐  rising  demands  on  the  planet’s  finite  natural  resources,  capitalism  will  become  unviable  as  resources  are  increasingly  depleted,  overworked,  or  made  scarce  by  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  The  problem  in  the  38  Graeme  Wearden,  “Oxfam:  85  richest  people  as  wealthy  as  poorest  half  of  the  world,”  The  Guardian  (January  20,  2014),    85-­‐richest-­‐people-­‐half-­‐of-­‐the-­‐world;  the  original  study  is  by  Oxfam  2014.  In  1999,  the  United  Nations  Development  Program  reported  “The  net  worth  of  the  world’s  200  richest  people  increased  from  $440  billion  to  more  than  $1  trillion  in  just  the  four  years  from  1994  to  1998.  The  assets  of  the  three  richest  people  were  more  than  the  combined  GNP  of  the  48  least  developed  countries”:  UNDP  Human  Development  Report:  Globalization  with  a  Human  Face  (New  York:  UNDP,  1999),  36-­‐37,  quoted  in  Vijay  Prasad,  The  Poorer  Nations:  A  Possible  History  of  the  Global  South  (London:  Verso,  2014),  234.  24  medium-­‐term  future  of  capitalism  (e.g.  the  next  25-­‐50  years)  is  that  the  natural  resource  base  necessary  for  producing  what  humans  require  to  survive  will  no  longer  be  dependable.  While  some  excellent  advocates  of  sustainable  development,  notably  British  ecological  economist  and  University  of  Surrey  professor  Tim  Jackson,39  have  advanced  the  important  idea  that  an  ecologically-­‐guided  “degrowth”  economy  is  a  solution  to  this  contradiction,  what’s  missing  is  a  convincing  case  that  this  could  be  delivered  under  the  political  economy  of  capitalism  as  we  know  it.  Naomi  Klein  puts  it  this  way:  The  bottom  line  is  what  matters  here:  our  economic  system  and  our  planetary  system  are  now  at  war.  Or,  more  accurately,  our  economy  is  at  war  with  many  forms  of  life  on  earth,  including  human  life.  What  the  climate  needs  in  order  to  avoid  collapse  is  a  contraction  in  humanity’s  use  of  resources;  what  our  economic  model  demands  to  avoid  collapse  is  unfettered  expansion.  Only  one  of  these  sets  of  rules  can  be  changed,  and  it’s  not  the  laws  of  nature.40  Nor  does  it  appear  realistic  that  capitalism  can  be  radically  reformed,  even  with  all  the  political  will  in  the  world  (currently  conspicuous  by  its  absence)  in  the  necessary  time  frame  (by  2050),  by  which  point  climate  science  tells  us  the  vast  majority  of  emissions  must  have  ended.  Australian  journalist  Renfrey  Clarke  asks  a  most  pertinent  question:  “What  is  it  about  39  Tim  Jackson,  Prosperity  without  Growth:  Economics  for  a  Finite  Planet  (Oxford:  Earthscan,  2011),    40  Klein,  This  Changes  Everything,  21.  capitalism  that  the  system  willfully  pursues  strategies  that  look  certain  to  bring  about  its  own  demise?”  The  answer  lies  in  the  fact  that  while  an  unaddressed  climate  crisis  will  be  lethal  to  capitalism,  the  solutions  to  the  crisis  also  promise  to  bring  the  system  down  –  and  sooner.  The  capitalists’  dilemma  becomes  clearer  if  we  list  some  of  the  key  measures  required….:  –  Material  and  financial  resources  need  to  be  reoriented,  in  a  concerted  way,  from  the  pursuit  of  maximum  profit  toward  achieving  rapid  declines  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  –  This  reorientation  of  the  economy  will  need  to  include  a  large  element  of  direct  state  spending,  structured  around  long-­‐term  planning  and  backed  by  tightening  regulation.  Schemes  such  as  carbon  pricing  cannot  play  more  than  a  limited,  subsidiary  role.  –  To  keep  mass  living  standards  at  the  highest  levels  consistent  with  these  measures,  and  ensure  popular  support,  the  main  costs  of  the  reorientation  need  to  be  levied  on  the  wealthy.41  He  concludes  “Can  anyone  imagine  the  world’s  capitalist  elites  agreeing  to  such  measures,  except  perhaps  under  the  most  extreme  popular  pressure?”  and  closes  by  quoting  Noam  Chomsky:  “In  the  moral  41  Renfrey  Clarke,  “Climate  Change:  Evidence  of  the  Death-­‐  wish  of  Capitalism”  (April  26,  2014),    25  calculus  of  capitalism,  greater  profits  in  the  next  quarter  outweigh  the  fate  of  your  grandchildren.”42  Of  course,  both  the  depth  of  the  current  crisis,  and  the  central  role  played  by  the  climate  disruption  that  exacerbates  it,  suggest  that  our  activism  around  climate  change  may  be  one  of  the  keys  to  moving  beyond  capitalism  in  our  lifetime.  It  seems  increasingly  evident  that  only  a  strong  and  vigorous  climate  justice  movement  on  a  global  scale  has  the  capacity  to  force  governments  to  stand  up  to  the  economic  and  political  forces  of  carbon  capitalism  to  agree  to  the  treaty  and  take  the  other  actions  needed  to  keep  the  planet  under  the  dangerous  threshold  of  2  degrees  Celsius.  The  Trajectory  of  the  Global  Climate  Justice  Movement  Let’s  consider  the  historical  arc  of  this  movement  so  far.  One  dividing  line  straddles  the  end  of  2009,  when  the  COP  15  climate  summit  met  in  Copenhagen  amidst  great  public  fanfare  and  media  attention  in  anticipation  of  a  deal  on  climate.  The  global  climate  justice  movement  had  announced  its  existence  two  years  before,  at  the  COP  13  meeting  in  Bali  in  2007,  when  the  radical  network  Climate  Justice  Now!  formed,  and  attracted  to  it  some  formidable  forces.  These  included  the  international  peasant  movement  Via  Campesina,  the  youthful  young  climate  justice  radicals  who  started  Camp  for  Climate  Action  in  the  U.K.,  Jubilee  South  and  the  intellectuals  around  Third  World  Network  and  Focus  on  the  Global  South,  Friends  of  the  42  Javier  Sethness,  “Noam  Chomsky:  Ecology,  Ethics,  Anarchism,”  Truthout  (April  3,  2014),      anarchism  Earth  International  [FOEI],  the  Durban  Group  for  Climate  Justice,  and  many  others  perhaps  just  outside  it,  among  them  the  indispensable  Bill  McKibben  and  a  rising  350.org.  In  Copenhagen,  climate  justice  advocates  and  activists  had  support  inside  the  negotiation  halls,  as  well  as  outside  on  the  streets,  where  100,000  people  marched  for  the  planet.  Their  allies  included  Mohamed  Nasheed  of  the  Maldives  and  much  of  the  40-­‐plus  member  strong  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States  (AOSIS);  Bolivian  president  Evo  Morales,  Venezuela’s  Hugo  Chávez  and  the  ALBA  (Bolivarian  Alliance)  left-­‐of-­‐center  countries  of  Latin  America’s  Pink  Tide;  and  a  less  radical  but  important  part  of  the  Global  North,  most  notably  the  European  Union,  led  by  Gordon  Brown  in  the  UK,  Germany,  and  some  of  the  Scandinavian  governments.  When  the  United  States  and  China,  the  world’s  two  biggest  emitters  of  greenhouse  gases,  failed  to  find  any  common  ground,  the  talks  collapsed.  In  reality,  neither  they  nor  any  of  the  other  large  emitting  countries  were  willing  to  significantly  curb  the  burning  of  fossil  fuels  on  which  their  economies  ran.  With  the  economic  collapse  that  triggered  the  Great  Recession  in  the  same  year,  the  balance  of  forces  shifted  decisively  away  from  the  positions  of  AOSIS  and  ALBA,  while  the  EU  aligned  itself  more  and  more  with  the  rest  of  the  global  North.  Building  a  Radical  Climate  Justice  Movement  But  the  second  part  of  the  subtitle  of  Bond’s  book  was  “Movement  Below,”  and  in  fact  the  global  climate  justice  movement  regrouped  and  built  new  momentum  in  Cochabamba,  Bolivia  in  April  2009  to  deliver  a  magnificent  manifesto,  “The  Universal  Declaration  of  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth.”  Many  activists,  26  from  Bond  himself  to  McKibben,  and  many  organizations  from  350.org  to  FOEI  have  withdrawn  energy  from  what  they  see  as  a  hopelessly  compromised  process  in  the  COPs,  and  put  it  instead  into  local  and  national-­‐level  campaigns  and  building  networked  global  coalitions.  These  have  brought  us  some  of  the  epic  struggles  of  recent  years,  from  the  many-­‐sided  battle  over  the  Keystone  pipeline  to  the  ongoing  movements  against  fracking  sprouting  across  the  United  States  to  the  community  fight  to  stop  the  expansion  of  the  port  in  south  Durban,  South  Africa  into  the  largest  on  the  continent.  Alongside  these  struggles  a  new  front  inside  and  around  the  COP  has  emerged  in  the  form  of  a  strengthened  and  newly  powerful  global  youth  climate  justice  movement,  which  has  been  blossoming  from  one  COP  to  the  next.  This  movement  is  also  active  in  many  local  campaigns.  They’ve  mounted  the  fossil  free  divestment  campaigns  in  the  U.S.  and  the  UK,  are  playing  an  important  role  in  the  epic  battle  against  the  Keystone  XL  pipeline  in  Canada  and  the  U.S.  alongside  a  revitalized  Canadian  indigenous  movement  led  by  Idle  No  More,  and  have  energized  the  anti-­‐  fracking  movement  in  California  and  elsewhere.  They  have  brought  to  the  movement  a  new  generation  influenced  by  the  moment  of  Occupy  and  other  movements  with  a  strong  emphasis  on  consensus  decision-­‐making  and  non-­‐hierarchical  organizational  structures  (a  process  known  as  “horizontalism”).  Additionally,  they’ve  brought  along  some  new  and  not-­‐so-­‐new  ways  of  organizing  that  have  real  promise:  Power  Shift,  social  media  of  all  kinds,  and  vast  reserves  of  imagination,  energy,  openness,  and  hope.  In  a  word,  they  are  re-­‐imagining  climate  justice.43  The  time  has  never  been  more  urgent  for  “assembling  the  biggest  social  movement  the  world  has  ever  seen”  to  combat  “the  biggest  crisis  humanity  has  ever  faced”  (to  paraphrase  Bill  McKibben).  Consider  the  following:  parts  of  the  radical  left  are  turning  their  attention  to  climate  change,  while  the  radical  climate  justice  movement  is  turning  its  attention  to  anti-­‐capitalist  politics.  At  the  same  time,  the  Big  Green  environmental  organizations  (especially  the  Sierra  Club),  the  mainstream  global  climate  justice  movement  (such  as  CAN,  the  Climate  Action  Network,  which  publishes  the  indispensable  Eco  daily  briefings  at  the  COP),  and  the  biggest  climate  social  movement  organization  (350.org)  are  all  moving  in  more  radical  directions.  The  same  can  be  said  of  climate  science  in  general  (the  directness  of  the  IPCC’s  Fifth  Assessment  Report,  among  others)  and  particular  climate  scientists  such  as  Kevin  Anderson,  Alice  Bows,  Michael  Mann,  or  James  Hansen.  Finally,  there  is  an  enormous  push  coming  up  from  young  people,  and  from  indigenous  forces  on  all  of  these  levels.  The  Present  Moment  The  question  that  the  global  climate  justice  movement  is  now  asking  is  what  are  the  prospects  for  synergy  and  movement  building  among  all  the  forces  fighting  for  the  climate  in  one  way  or  another?  What  are  the  ways  forward?  24  “Re-­‐Imagining  Climate  Justice”  is  the  name  given  to  a  gathering  of  the  movement  in  Santa  Barbara,  California,  in  May  2014  in  which  I  played  a  role  ();  see  Summer  Gray’s  video  at    27  It’s  past  time  for  the  movement  to  engage  all  hands  in  a  major  re-­‐think  moving  forward.  As  Paul  Wapner,  has  put  it:  “The  scarcest  resource  these  days  …  is  the  ability  to  unleash  the  mind,  heart,  and  spirit  to  envision,  entertain,  and  develop  unorthodox  possibilities….  Imagination,  in  this  sense,  is  not  a  flight  of  fancy  but  closer  to  what  C.  Wright  Mills  understands  as  the  ability  to  grasp  a  larger  arc  of  collective  experience  and  interpret  its  meaning  for  the  choices  we  face.  This  involves  disciplined  inspiration,  creativity,  and  ingenuity  that  can  help  us  cognitively  and  emotionally  enter  into  alternative  futures.”44  This  is  not  to  accuse  anyone  of  lack  of  imagination  –  far  from  it.  I  take  it  as  a  call  to  mobilize  our  brilliant  creativity  and  unleash  our  radical  imaginations  to  work  together  with  new  resolve  and  joy.  And  so,  I  offer  here  a  few  of  the  many,  many  possibilities  (I  am  not  saying  I  support  all  of  these;  they  are  offered  here  only  for  discussion):  At  the  COP:  go  to  a  majority  vote  on  the  treaty.  What  if,  say,  120  countries  ratified  a  treaty  covering  more  than  50  percent  of  the  world  population  and/or  emissions?  Might  this  force  the  United  States,  China,  the  EU,  the  BRICs  to  join  later?  What  if  there  were  ways  to  incentivize  one  or  more  of  these  big  emitters  to  join  the  “majority”?  What  if  –  for  the  sake  of  argument  –  we  were  to  accept  Obama’s  latest  proposal  to  avoid  the  non-­‐  starter  of  ratification  of  a  binding  treaty  by  the  U.S.  Senate  by  negotiating  non-­‐binding  pledges  only?45  Conversely,  it’s  conceivable  (if  not  likely)  that  a  “big  two”  (China  and  the  44  Paul  Wapner,  book  description  for  Reimagining  Climate  Change,  informal  communication,  summer  2014.  45  Cf.  Ben  Adler,  “Obama  has  a  Plan  for  Getting  around  Senate  Opposition  to  a  Climate  Treaty”  (August  27,  2014).  U.S.)  or  “three  or  four”  (with  the  E.U.  or  India,  etc.)  could  broker  a  deal.  Whether  it  would  be  a  good  deal  is  another  question  and  hurdle  to  surmount.  In  any  case,  it’s  time  to  abandon  the  fruitless  search  for  consensus  among  irreconcilable  visions  of  the  future,  some  of  which  are  counter-­‐productive,  if  not  genocidal,  and  which  allows  climate  criminals  like  the  current  governments  of  Canada,  Saudi  Arabia,  Australia,  or  Poland  to  obstruct,  dilute,  and  veto  the  necessary  treaty  provisions.  No  longer  should  one  or  two  recalcitrant  parties  possess  the  power  to  hold  hostage  humanity’s  future.  The  Social  Pre-­‐COP.  In  terms  of  the  build-­‐up  to  the  COP  21  in  Paris,  we  may  note  a  number  of  developments,  starting  with  the  intriguing  Venezuelan  initiative  to  hold  two  “Social  Pre-­‐  COP”  gatherings  in  2014  focused  on  youth,  indigenous  peoples,  and  various  movement  capacity  building  gatherings.  As  Venezuela’s  lead  negotiator  Claudia  Salerno  put  it  in  announcing  it  at  the  2013  Warsaw  COP  19,  “A  situation  of  madness  requires  a  little  craziness,”  adding,  “We  are  not  afraid  to  fail….  [There  is]  nothing  to  lose,  and  maybe  a  lot  to  gain.”  At  the  first  of  these  in  mid-­‐July  those  present  issued  the  Margarita  Declaration,  a  13-­‐page  manifesto  which  concluded:  “We  need  to  create  our  own  dreams,  forget  the  perverse  developmentalist  dream,  and  find  inspiration  in  ourselves.  We  need  to  share  a  new  narrative  based  on  our  own  experiences.”46  A  second  Social  Pre-­‐COP  is  scheduled  for  November  4-­‐7  in  Caracas.  The  Global  Climate  Convergence  and  System  Change  Not  Climate  Change.  Another  major  new  campaign,  in  the  United  States,  is  the  46  The  Margarita  Declaration  on  Climate  Change,  Margarita  Island,  Social  PreCOP  Preparatory  Meeting,  Venezuela  (July  18,  2014):  Changing  the  system,  not  the  climate.  This  manifesto  is  also  found  in  the  Appendix  to  our  Report.  28  Global  Climate  Convergence,  which  proclaims  “People,  Planet,  Peace  over  Profits”  and  is  seeking  to  build  “collaboration  across  national  borders  and  fronts  of  struggle  to  harness  the  transformative  power  we  already  possess  as  a  thousand  separate  movements  springing  up  across  the  planet.”  The  basic  idea  is  to  create  a  lasting  collaboration  between  climate  activism  and  other  forms  of  social  justice,  including  progressive  labor,  indigenous  organizing,  and  the  fledgling  ecosocialist  movement  in  the  United  States,  and  ultimately,  no  doubt,  beyond.  Convened  by  Jill  Stein,  2012  presidential  candidate  of  the  Green  Party  of  the  United  States,  this  call  resonates  with  the  formation  of  the  new  U.S.  ecosocialist  organization  System  Change  Not  Climate  Change),  which  aims  at  shifting  the  momentum  of  the  climate  justice  movement  in  an  anti-­‐capitalist  direction  by  starting  “a  far-­‐ranging  discussion  within  society:  can  stopping  climate  change  be  compatible  with  an  economic  system  that  is  flooded  with  fossil  fuel  profits?  Can  we  create  a  safe  and  healthy  planet  for  all  human  beings  while  simultaneously  allowing  ever-­‐expanding  resource  extraction,  endless  growth,  and  the  massive  inequalities  that  come  along  with  it?”  The  People’s  Climate  March.  Meanwhile,  the  faltering  momentum  for  a  global  climate  deal  received  a  strong  new  push  at  the  People’s  Climate  March  attended  by  some  400,000  people  in  New  York  City  on  September  21,  2014,  an  event  which  may  well  be  seen  in  future  histories  as  the  turning  point  in  the  evolution  of  a  strong  North  American  climate  justice  movement.47  When  U.N.  Secretary-­‐  General  Ban  Ki-­‐moon  convened  a  special  Climate  Summit  2014:  Catalyzing  Action  with  the  charge:  “This  Summit  is  meant  to  be  a  47  See    and    19-­‐ny-­‐climate-­‐convergence-­‐2014-­‐09-­‐19-­‐211500  solutions  summit,  not  a  negotiating  session.  I  have  invited  all  Heads  of  State  and  Government,  along  with  leaders  from  business  and  finance,  local  government  and  civil  society.  I  am  asking  all  who  come  to  bring  bold  and  new  announcements  and  action.  I  am  asking  them  to  bring  their  big  ideas,”48  very  little  happened  inside  the  UN  but  a  lot  happened  on  the  outside:  the  multiple  workshops,  gatherings,  and  public  events  in  the  days  leading  up  to  the  march,  the  unprecedented,  massive,  diverse  climate  march  itself,  the  “Flood  Wall  Street”  direct  action  of  the  following  day,  and  the  countless  initiatives  that  are  bound  to  emerge  from  the  thousands  of  people  who  saw  their  commitment  grow  and  their  possibilities  for  action  widen  as  a  result  of  their  participation.  An  important  agenda  item  for  this  gathering  might  be  the  development  of  a  people’s  plan  for  radical  emissions  reductions  (I  propose  some  tentative  first  thoughts  on  this  in  an  appendix  to  this  essay.  Just  as  Ban  had  hoped  to  kickstart  a  UN  process  that  is  driven  by  stalemate  from  above,  the  global  climate  justice  movement  is  building  fresh  momentum  from  below  as  it  strives  to  find  the  ways  to  bring  into  full  flowering  the  biggest  social  movement  the  world  has  ever  seen.  What  Now?  Thinking  Forward  What  follows  from  our  observations  to  this  point?  I  offer  a  few  ideas  for  discussion  here  as  a  contribution  to  the  global  process  of  figuring  out  how  to  move  forward.  Our  movement  should  aim  beyond  capitalism  48  Ban  Ki-­‐moon,  “Big  Idea  2014:  The  Year  for  Climate  Action”  (December  11,  2013),    idea-­‐2014-­‐the-­‐year-­‐for-­‐climate-­‐action/  29  It  seems  to  me  that  the  only  real  systemic  “solution”  to  the  crisis  is  a  radical  anti-­‐  capitalist  climate  justice  movement  capable  of  decisively  cutting  emissions  in  a  just  way.  This  movement,  or  convergence  and  confluence  of  many  movements,  has  to  be  a  broad  anti-­‐capitalist  movement,  and  it  has  to  get  there  in  the  relatively  medium  term  (the  next  25-­‐50  years,  or  by  2040  to  2065).  In  the  short  term  (from  now  out  10-­‐15  years,  or  from  2015  to  2025  or  2030),  the  task  is  to  build  a  broad  radical  climate  justice  movement  everywhere  we  can,  preparing  a  new  generation  for  the  longer  anti-­‐capitalist  project  of  deep  social  transformation.  We  also  have  to  learn  more  about  how  to  build  social  movements  and,  perhaps,  a  totally  new  and  different  kind  of  political  party  (we  need  much  speculation  about  this),  because  the  two  together  might  succeed  where  individually  they  have  not.  This  is  the  central  thesis  of  another  project  I  am  working  on  that  surveys  radical  social  movements  in  the  twenty-­‐first  century,  contrasting  them  with  the  social  revolutions  that  tried  to  shape  positive  social  transformation  in  the  twentieth.49  We  need  to  learn  our  own  power  and  how  to  use  it  wisely  to  transcend  the  polarizing  debate  between  the  horizontalism  of  Occupy  and  efforts  to  transform  societies  by  bringing  progressive  political  forces  to  state  power.  Our  politics  within  that  movement  have  to  be  informed  by  our  anti-­‐capitalism,  and  positively,  we  need  to  do  some  thinking  about  what  to  call  our  vision  of  a  post-­‐  49  The  arguments  are  sketched  in  a  preliminary  fashion  in  John  Foran,  “Beyond  Insurgency  to  Radical  Social  Change:  The  New  Situation,”  Studies  in  Social  Justice  8  (1)  (2014):  5-­‐  25.  capitalist  future,  what  it  will  look  like,  and,  of  course,  how  to  get  there  on  schedule.  Going  global  One  approach  to  understanding  the  current  state  of  play  would  be  a  country  by  country  analysis  of  the  top  ten  emitting  nations:  their  climate  profile,  their  political  situation,  the  state  of  their  civil  society  (suffering?  unemployed?  worries  about  what?),  and  the  strength  of  their  climate  justice  movement.  From  here  one  could  try  to  work  out  a  regional  analysis  of  this  kind  as  well,  as  a  prelude  to  a  global  analysis.  This  kind  of  detailed  analysis  is  far  beyond  the  scope  of  what  I  can  do  here.  No  matter  how  it  would  look,  it  seems  clear  that  we  need  to  strengthen  and  make  connections  within  and  between  such  places  as:  n North  America  –  the  U.S.  and  Canada,  because  these  constitute,  respectively,  the  biggest  problem  country  in  the  world,  and  one  of  the  dirtiest  rich  countries  (along  with  Australia).  The  fronts  are  the  battle  against  the  tar  sands  and  Keystone  pipeline,  the  fossil  fuel  divestment  movement,  and  the  hundreds,  perhaps  thousands,  of  local  environmental  justice  struggles.  The  New  York  City  People’s  Climate  March  in  September  2014  is  evidence  that  we  are  in  the  first  stages  of  building  a  big,  powerful  new  radical  climate  justice  movement  including,  among  others,  350.org,  SCNCC,  the  Green  Party  of  the  USA,  the  Climate  Justice  Alliance/Our  Power  campaign,  the  Cowboy  and  Indian  Alliance,  the  Indigenous  Environmental  Network,  Idle  No  More,  the  Climate  Action  Network,  Sierra  Club,  the  youth  climate  justice  movement,  PowerShift,  Occupy,  indymedia  and  climate  bloggers  and  websites,  churches,  30  universities,  the  huge  numbers  of  communities  on  the  front  lines  where  all  kinds  of  environmental  and  climate  justice  grassroots  work  is  happening,  progressive  unions,  feminists,  anti-­‐racists,  and  anarchists.  n The  European  Union  and  Europe  more  generally  –  the  U.K.,  Germany,  Scandinavia,  along  with  others,  such  as  the  short-­‐lived  Green-­‐Left  experiment  in  Iceland  –  have  led  the  global  North’s  governments  in  the  direction  along  which  they  need  to  go  much  further:  renewable  energy,  green  building,  attractive  public  transportation  networks,  and  so  on.  To  get  the  global  North  on  board  for  a  just  climate  treaty  will  require  strong  leadership  from  the  EU,  or  at  least  a  few  key  European  countries,  to  push  for  deep  and  legally  binding  cuts,  a  good  deal  beyond  anything  proposed  so  far  from  that  quarter.  This,  in  turn,  requires  progressive,  accountable  political  parties  in  power,  and  to  achieve  that  requires  strong  national-­‐  level  climate  justice  movements.  n The  BASIC  countries  -­‐-­‐  Brazil:  one  could  imagine  the  Movement  of  Landless  Workers  (MST)  and  a  radicalized  Workers  Party  –  the  governing  PT,  if  it  can  be  done,  or  if  not,  perhaps  progressive  members  of  the  PT  joining  to  form  an  ecologically  minded  party  with  the  independent  left  or  perhaps  the  Green  Party  -­‐-­‐  might  fuse  into  something  new.50  50  In  the  first  round  of  the  October  6,  2014  presidential  elections,  incumbent  Dilma  Yousef  polled  41  percent  (43  million  votes),  right-­‐winger  Aécio  Neves  34  percent  (35  million)  ,  and  Green  candidate  Marina  Silva  21  percent  (22  million),  suggesting  that  such  a  new  type  of  party  might  one  day  be  viable.  Disappointingly,  Silva  backed  Neves  in  the  runoff,  suggesting  just  how  much  work  needs  to  be  done.  -­‐-­‐  India:  The  impressive  half-­‐century  of  sustainable  social  democratic  society  established  in  Kerala  contains  the  seeds  of  a  better  development  model  that  should  be  studied  more  widely.51  On  the  other  hand,  the  new  Prime  Minister,  Narendra  Modi,  was  actually  in  New  York  the  day  of  the  U.N.  climate  summit,  but  didn’t  attend.52  -­‐-­‐  China:  The  contradictions  of  China’s  breakneck  industrial  growth  have  caused  countless  local  pushbacks  from  communities  which  are  suffering  the  effects  of  pollution  and  poisoning  of  their  land  and  water;  the  same  is  true  of  wildcat  labor  strikes.  Both  trends  are  increasingly  eliciting  new  climate  change  policy  from  the  government,  well  aware  of  the  paradoxes  of  its  relatively  recent  emergence  as  the  single  greatest  contributor  to  emissions  and  simultaneously  the  world’s  greatest  consumer  of  coal  and  producer  of  solar  power.53  Meanwhile,  according  to  a  Pew  Research  poll,  China  and  the  U.S.  are  virtually  tied  as  the  most  poorly  educated  populations  in  climate  change  (although  51  Though  dated,  the  best  overview  of  Kerala  remains  Richard  W.

The  AYCM  has  been  very  active  with  the  global  youth  climate  justice  movement  at  subsequent  COPs  and  is  building  national  movements  across  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  from  the  ground  up.  Among  their  approaches  is  to  view  the  climate  crisis  as  “an  opportunity  to  create  a  more  sustainable,  prosperous,  meaningful,  just,  and  fair  world.”56  -­‐-­‐  Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  Tunisia,  the  only  Arab  Spring  country  which  has  established  a  reasonably  well-­‐functioning  representative  democracy,  re-­‐wrote  its  constitution  after  the  fall  of  the  dictator,  Ben  Ali,  to  include  reference  to  fighting  climate  change.57  n Oceania  and  the  “small”  island  states  55  See  their  website  at    us/  56  The  AYCM  maintains  a  strong  presence  at    57  John  Upton,  Tunisia’s  new  constitution  calls  for  climate  protection  (February  4,  2014),    new-­‐constitution-­‐calls-­‐for-­‐climate-­‐  protection/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&  utm_term=Daily%2520Feb%25204&utm_campaign=daily  32  -­‐-­‐  The  loss  of  climate  hero  Mohamed  Nasheed  in  the  2013  election  in  his  country  has  set  back  the  global  cause  for  climate  justice  enormously.

These  political  cultures  drew  on  people’s  experiences  and  emotions  and  were  expressed  in  complex  mixtures  of  popular,  everyday  ways  of  expressing  grievances  –  fairness,  justice,  dignity,  or  58  See  Summer  Gray  and  John  Foran,  “Climate  Injustice:  The  Real  History  of  the  Maldives,”  Berkeley  Journal  of  Sociology  58  (September  2014),    real-­‐history-­‐of-­‐the-­‐maldives/  59  The  speech  can  be  heard  at    60  John  Foran,  “Global  Affinities:  The  New  Cultures  of  Resistance  behind  the  Arab  Spring,”  pp.  45-­‐71  in  Mehran  Kamrava,  editor,  The  Evolving  Ruling  Bargain  in  the  Middle  East  (Oxford:  Oxford  University  Press,  2014).  freedom  –  and  more  consciously  articulated  radical  ideologies  such  as  socialism  and  liberation  theology.  The  most  effective  revolutionary  movements  of  history  have  found  ways  to  tap  into  whatever  political  cultures  emerge  in  their  society,  often  through  the  creation  of  a  common  goal  such  as  “the  regime  must  step  down”  or  “the  foreign  powers  must  leave.”  The  forging  of  a  strong  and  vibrant  political  culture  of  opposition  is  thus  an  accomplishment,  carried  through  by  the  actions  of  many  people,  and,  like  revolutions  themselves,  such  cultures  are  relatively  rare  in  human  history.  In  the  twenty-­‐first  century,  the  nature  of  movements  for  what  we  might  now  call  radical  social  change  (rather  than  revolution)  has  itself  changed,  as  activists,  reformers,  dreamers,  and  revolutionaries  globally  have  more  often  pursued  nonviolent  paths  to  a  better  world,  intending  to  live  and  act  as  they  would  like  that  world  to  be.  That  is,  the  ends  of  justice  are  no  longer  held  to  justify  the  means  of  violence,  but  the  means  of  non-­‐  violent  resistance  reflect  and  guarantee  the  ends  that  they  seek.  In  this,  they  embody  and  illustrate  the  virtues  of  prefigurative  politics  and  in  particular,  horizontalist  ways  to  realize  them.  I  call  these  positive,  alternative  visions  “political  cultures  of  creation.”  61  Movements  become  even  stronger,  when  to  a  widely  felt  culture  of  opposition  and  resistance,  they  add  a  positive  vision  of  a  better  world,  an  alternative  to  strive  for  to  improve  or  replace  61  Foran,  “Beyond  Insurgency  to  Radical  Social  Change.”  33  what  exists.  In  this  sense,  some  of  the  differences  between  old  and  new  movements  for  radical  social  change  seem  to  include  the  attempt  to  get  away  from  the  hierarchical  organizations  that  made  the  great  revolutions  and  move  in  the  direction  of  more  horizontal,  deeply  democratic  relations  among  participants;  the  expressive  power  of  using  popular  idioms  more  than  ideological  discourses;  the  growing  use  of  nonviolence;  the  building  of  coalitions  as  networks  of  movements  and  organizations  to  include  diverse  outlooks;  and  the  salience  of  political  cultures  of  creation  alongside  political  cultures  of  opposition  and  resistance.  What  might  go  into  a  radical  political  culture  of  climate  justice?  On  the  level  of  emotions,  we  would  perhaps  do  well  to  cultivate  what  Gustavo  Esteva  has  termed  “joyful  militancy:”  We  are  suggesting  that  a  useful  way  to  think  about  radical  politics  is  through  the  lens  of  joy  and  sadness….  Joy  means  letting  the  world  in  and  letting  oneself  into  the  world:  being  vulnerable,  compassionate,  experimental,  creative,  and  embracing  uncertainty.  Sadness  means  creating  boundaries,  making  distinctions,  comparing,  making  plans,  and  so  on….  All  movements,  spaces,  collectives,  and  individuals  have  elements  of  joy  and  sadness:  they’re  bound  together,  they  help  and  hinder  each  other,  and  they’re  constantly  shifting  and  changing.  We  often  need  good  boundaries  to  create  radical  spaces  in  an  oppressive  world,  we  need  to  make  plans  and  be  open  to  changing  them  and  changing  ourselves.  Our  suspicion,  or  feeling,  or  hunch,  or  experience  is  that  there  is  too  much  sadness  and  not  enough  joy  in  a  lot  of  radical  movements  and  spaces  today.  There  is  a  lot  of  energy  and  investment  in  thinking  intellectually,  making  distinctions,  closure,  and  creating  boundaries,  and  we  think  that  is  squeezing  out  possibilities  for  conviviality,  creativity,  and  kindness….  However–and  this  is  REALLY  important  to  us–while  we  are  making  a  distinction  here,  we  are  not  trying  to  construct  a  simple  binary.  We’re  calling  joy  and  sadness  an  “ecology”  because  there  are  always  elements  of  both  in  our  movements….  Furthermore,  this  is  less  about  individuals  and  their  identifications  and  more  about  collective  spaces,  desires,  and  movements.  We  are  arguing  that  “sad  militancy”  is  hegemonic:  that  it  predominates  in  many  radical  spaces  today,  squeezing  out  possibilities  for  conviviality  and  friendship.  We’re  trying  to  offer  up  a  conception  of  “joyful  militancy”  based  on  spaces,  movements,  thinkers,  and  doers  who  have  inspired  us,  but  there’s  no  formula  or  guidebook.  Even  more  importantly,  we  really  don’t  want  to  suggest  a  new  set  of  norms  that  should  govern  or  police  people  into  behaving  a  certain  way:  that  would  be  an  utter  failure.  We  hope  joyful  militancy  can  remain  loose  and  34  vague,  while  offering  up  some  ideas  that  are  inspiring  and  useful  to  think  through.62  Similarly,  it  might  be  important  to  cultivate  new  languages  and  ways  of  being  together;  here,  one  might  think  of  the  whole  Occupy  repertoire,  so  well  captured  in  the  book  and  website,  Beautiful  Trouble.  Or  the  “meme  projects”  –  Patrick  Reinsborough  and  Doyle  Canning’s  handbook,    Change:  An  Introduction  to  Story-­‐based  Strategy;  Occupy’s  “We  ...  are…  the  99  percent!”  Or  drawing  from  the  history  of  our  own  movement,  that  simple  profound  slogan  “System  Change,  Not  Climate  Change,”  so  evocative  and  powerful  (and  very  astutely  chosen  by  the  new  North  American  network  of  the  same  name).  In  all  of  this,  “artivism,”  creativity,  and  love  are  the  prominent,  and  youth  movements  everywhere  are  inventing  and  carrying  the  new  political  cultures  of  creation.  As  for  new  ideas  about  building  alliances,  one  idea  that  lots  of  people  are  finding  illuminating  is  “the  spectrum  of  allies  and  opponents  model”:  62  Gustavo  Esteva,  “The  Ecology  of  Joy  in  Our  Radical  Movements  and  Spaces,”    ecology-­‐of-­‐joy-­‐in-­‐our-­‐radical-­‐movements-­‐and-­‐spaces/  Veronika  Libao  explains  the  idea  this  way:  The  most  important  thing  this  movement  has  to  realize  in  order  to  accomplish  its  goal  is  the  fact  that  it  can  never  convince  everyone,  and  that  is  completely  fine….The  “spectrum  of  allies”  model  avoids  wasting  valuable  energy  in  convincing  those  in  active  opposition.  Instead,  it  focuses  on  shifting  those  in  a  passive  opposition  to  neutral,  those  in  a  neutral  position  to  passive  allies,  and  passive  allies  to  active  allies  (as  shown  in  the  diagram).  As  disheartening  it  is  to  know  that  there  are  those  who  openly  choose  to  ignore  climate  change,  there  are  plenty  of  others  who  devote  their  lives  to  ensuring  that  those  people  don’t  ruin  the  planet  for  all  of  us.63  The  key  is  to  unlock  ways  to  bring  together  increasingly  radical,  increasingly  broad  forces  together,  to  multiply  our  impact  and  networks  exponentially,  learn  to  build  the  bridges,  and  generate  the  new  ideas  we  need.  The  Briefest  of  Conclusions  What  everyone  brings  to  the  table  in  the  struggle  for  global  climate  justice  has  value.  The  movements  for  climate  justice  around  the  world  need  all  hands  on  deck,  now  and  for  as  far  as  anyone  can  see  into  the  future.  This  is  the  challenge  the  global  climate  justice  movement  faces  now.  63  Veronika  Libao,  “The  Cheapening  of  Our  Lives:  Consumerism  and  its  Inevitable  Link  to  Climate  Change,”  a  paper  for  Sociology  134GJ:  Global  Justice  Movements,  UC  Santa  Barbara  (Summer  2014),  where  this  image  is  from.  The  “Spectrum  of  Allies”  was  presented  to  us  by  United  Kingdom  Youth  Climate  Coalition  members  Fatima  Ibrahim  and  Louisa  Casson.  35  Appendix:  Some  Principles  for  Radical  Emissions  Reduction  based  on  Climate  Justice  1. The  target  should  be  1.5  degrees  Celsius,  not  2  degrees.  2. The  burning  of  fossil  fuels  for  energy  has  to  be  rolled  back  decisively  and  quickly.  This  might  mean,  for  example,  cuts  of  ten  percent  a  year  starting  immediately  (or  one  percent,  then  increasing  by  two  percent  per  year  till  we  reach  10  percent  in  2020,  and  ten  percent  a  year  thereafter  till  we  approach  zero  emissions  by  2030.  The  sooner  we  start  on  this  path,  the  better.  3. The  global  South  –  and  indeed  all  peoples  –  have  a  “right  to  sustainable  development.”  From  this  it  follows  that  there  has  to  be  massive  redistribution  of  technology  and  funds  from  North  to  South  –  for  adaptation,  for  emissions  reductions,  for  meeting  the  basic  needs  of  every  human  on  the  planet,  for  the  loss  and  damages  of  extreme  weather  events  already  locked  into  Earth’s  climate  future.  4.  The  above  should  be  agreed  by  every  government  on  earth,  in  2015,  and  if  not  then,  we  must  step  up  our  resistance  exponentially  until  it  is  agreed.  What  this  means  should  be  thought  about  and  discussed  in  the  build-­‐up  to  December  2015.  36  Protecting  Climate  Policy  from  Dirty  Energy  Lobbying:  A  Working  Strategy  Document  Pascoe  Sabido  This  document  attempts  to  show  how  we  can  use  COP21  in  Paris  as  an  opportunity  to  lay  the  groundwork  and  build  the  political  and  public  support  for  a  mechanism  at  national,  regional  and  UNFCCC  levels  to  protect  climate  policy  making  from  the  dirty  energy  industry.  It  is  intended  as  a  basis  for  conversation,  to  be  worked  on  and  developed.  Problem  The  influence  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby  is  the  greatest  barrier  to  achieving  climate  policies  to  deliver  a  fair,  just  and  sustainable  world.  They  are  preventing  governments  in  the  global  north  fulfilling  their  obligations  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)64,  holding  back  an  equitable  and  ambitious  deal  at  the  international  level.  Through  their  influence,  these  same  corporations  –  whose  business  model  is  responsible  for  the  crisis  we  are  facing  –  are  profiting  from  the  promotion  of  false  solutions  that  worsen  the  crisis  and  generate  huge  profits.  Current  state  of  play  Dirty  energy  lobbying  –  and  corporate  influence  in  general  –  reached  unprecedented  levels  at  the  last  UNFCCC  talks  in  Warsaw,  COP19.  There  was  a  business-­‐only  pre-­‐COP,  multiple  corporate  64  The  UNFCCC  is  the  only  inclusive  multilateral  space  which  also  enshrines  the  top-­‐down,  rules-­‐based  approach  alongside  principles  of  equity  (historical  responsibility  enshrined  in  the  Annex  I  and  non-­‐Annex  I  system,  common  but  differentiated  responsibility,  respective  capabilities)  sponsors  including  dirty  energy  and  heavily  polluting  industries,  and  a  coal  summit  organised  alongside  the  talks,  attended  by  the  UNFCCC  Executive  Secretary  Christiana  Figueres.65  And  in  some  UNFCCC  institutions  –  like  the  Green  Climate  Fund  –  fossil  fuel  financiers  are  playing  key  roles  advising  and  making  recommendations  for  policy  governing  climate  finance.66  The  extent  to  which  the  dirty  energy  industry  was  being  listened  to  was  further  highlighted  by  more  than  800  civil  society  observers  prematurely  walking  out  of  the  talks  in  protest,  with  t-­‐  shirts  that  read  ‘polluters  talk,  we  walk’.  The  next  major  moment  in  the  talks  is  taking  place  in  2015  in  Paris,  COP21,  where  all  countries  are  supposed  to  agree  a  treaty  to  govern  the  post-­‐2020  climate  regime.  However,  current  expectations  are  very  low,  due  to  the  recalcitrance  of  Northern  governments  and  the  power  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby.  Opportunity?  There  is  a  big  opportunity  to  use  the  events  from  now  up  to  and  including  COP21  in  Paris  to  ensure  the  dirty  energy  industry  is  not  seen  as  an  acceptable  partner  in  making  climate  policy.  The  ultimate  aim  is  to  remove  them  altogether,  end  their  access  to  our  decision  makers  within  our  national  and  regional  governments  as  well  as  the  UNFCCC.  Only  by  ending  this  cosy  relationship  and  reclaiming  climate  policy  making  can  the  65  For  an  overview  of  the  corporate  capture  of  COP19,  see  Corporate  Europe  Observatory’s  blog  written  while  in  Warsaw,    climate-­‐blog  66  Bank  of  America  is  the  “developed  country”  private  sector  active  observer  to  the  Green  Climate  Fund  board,  and  XX  companies  are  serving  on  the  GCF’s  Private  Sector  Advisory  Panel  (PSAG),  which  is  responsible  for  making  recommendations  to  the  GCF  board  on  every  thing  from  fiduciary  standards  to  best  practices  on  intermediation  37  UNFCCC  deliver  an  equitable  and  ambitious  deal  for  current  and  future  generations.  It's  been  done  before  with  the  tobacco  lobby  –  Article  5.3  Other  UN  bodies  have  faced  similar  challenges  in  addressing  the  undue  influence  of  harmful  industries  and  dealt  with  the  situation  effectively,  such  as  the  UN  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO).  Article  5.3  of  its  global  tobacco  treaty,  the  Framework  Convention  on  Tobacco  Control  (FCTC),  enshrines  in  international  law  the  principle  that  the  tobacco  industry  has  no  role  in  public  health  policymaking,  due  to  the  “fundamental  and  irreconcilable  conflict  between  the  tobacco  industry's  interests  and  public  health  policy  interests”  and  states  that  ""Parties  shall  act  to  protect  these  policies  from  commercial  and  other  vested  interests  of  the  tobacco  industry"".67  Through  a  strong,  Southern-­‐led  civil-­‐society  coalition  working  at  national  and  international  level,  they  managed  to  achieve  this.  While  tobacco  and  fossil  fuels  are  very  different,  the  principle  of  irreconcilable  interests  –  between  that  of  industry  and  that  of  the  public  –  is  the  same.  Equally,  the  role  that  industry  has  played  in  preventing  legislation  around  both  is  very  similar,  with  Big  Energy  taking  many  of  its  strategies  directly  from  the  Big  Tobacco  playbook:  • funding  citizen  front  groups  to  provide  legitimacy  for  continued  dirty  energy  67  For  more  information  see  the  short  briefing    content/uploads//Stop-­‐Fossil-­‐Fuels-­‐Setting-­‐the-­‐  Climate-­‐Agenda_Briefing_Nov13-­‐2.pdf  or  the  longer  paper    content/uploads//Stop-­‐Fossil-­‐Fuels-­‐Setting-­‐the-­‐  Climate-­‐Agenda_Report_Dec2013_FINAL.pdf  solutions;  • manufacturing  doubt  around  climate  science  via  scientists  and  think  tanks;  • litigation  against  countries  working  to  address  climate  change;  • using  corporate  social  responsibility  activities  to  present  a  façade  of  action  while  their  core  business  model  remains  the  same;  • aggressive  lobbying  at  all  levels;  • infiltrating  key  government  arenas  at  national,  regional  and  international  level  • creating  public  partnerships  and  voluntary  solutions  to  avoid  regulation  The  tobacco  precedent  provides  a  very  powerful,  publicly-­‐understandable,  common-­‐  sense  example  which  can  be  used  further.  The  proposition  that  the  UN,  and  the  UNFCCC  in  particular,  should  take  action  to  protect  climate  policy-­‐making  from  the  dirty  energy  lobby  was  already  gaining  ground  in  Warsaw,  with  more  than  80  organisations  signing  onto  an  open  letter  to  UN  Secretary  General  Ban  Ki-­‐moon  and  UNFCCC  Executive  Secretary  Christiana  Figueres  asking  for  such  a  measure  in  light  of  the  evidence.68  More  events  since  then  show  a  growing  appetite:   French  climate  organisations  working  together  towards  COP21  wrote  to  the  three  ministers  responsible,  calling  on  them  to  introduce  a  similar  policy  to  Article  5.3  under  the  UNFCCC;69  • Approximately  300  organizations  –  most  from  the  global  south  –  penned  a  letter  to  68  See  here  for  the  English  version    protect-­‐integrity-­‐climate-­‐policy-­‐making-­‐vested-­‐corporate-­‐  interests  69  The  letter  was  written  by  Attac  France,  Centre  de  recherche  et  d’information  pour  le  développement  (CRID)  and  Réseau  Action  Climat,  with  15  other  signatories,    flux/article/climat-­‐assez-­‐de-­‐discours-­‐des-­‐actes  38  the  board  members  of  the  Green  Climate  Fund  demanding  that  dirty  energy  be  kept  out  of  the  fund;  • As  a  result  of  the  global  campaign  to  stop  corporate  impunity,  the  UN  Human  Rights  Council  agreed  to  establish  a  working  group  into  a  legally-­‐binding  instrument  over  the  operations  of  transnational  corporations;  • Increasing  numbers  of  organisations  fighting  corporate  take-­‐over  in  the  shape  of  the  US  and  EU  global  trade  deals  (TPP  and  TTIP);  • A  large  number  of  organisations  surveyed  by  the  Democracy  Centre  on  priorities  for  the  climate  movement  at  COP20  in  Lima  will  prioritise  tackling  corporate  power.  However,  for  a  strategy  to  be  successful  in  trying  to  reclaim  climate  policy  and  the  UNFCCC  from  the  dirty  energy  industries,  while  at  the  same  time  supporting  an  agenda  of  equity  and  ambition  within  it,  certain  sensitivities  must  be  taken  account  of:  • The  principles  of  equity  as  outlined  within  the  Convention  (and  contained  within  the  Rio  Declaration  of  1992)  have  been  under  attack  from  Northern  governments  (particularly  heavy  polluters  like  the  US  and  EU),  as  well  as  some  Northern  civil  society  groups  who  are  keen  to  get  any  deal  possible  even  if  it  means  sacrificing  equity,  and  thus  ambition;70  • Many  countries  in  the  global  South  70  Note:  if  equity  is  sacrificed,  then  so  is  ambition,  as  many  countries  in  the  global  South  who  are  already  taking  domestic  actions  –  and  who  have  been  waiting  since  the  signing  of  the  Kyoto  Protocol  in  1997  for  climate  leadership  from  Northern  countries  but  not  yet  seen  it  –  will  not  take  on  higher  commitments  without  either  the  finance,  technology  or  ambition  that  has  been  promised  from  Northern  countries  as  development  and  poverty  alleviation  will  be  prioritized  [very  short,  crude  summary  but  there’s  far  more  nuance  than  that].  defending  the  principles  of  equity  also  have  large  state-­‐owned  fossil  fuel  interests  and  see  cheap  energy  as  key  to  the  economic  growth  they  see  as  necessary  to  address  the  impacts  of  climate  change  as  well  as  poverty;  • Most  countries  in  the  global  South  will  have  far  less  capacity  within  the  negotiations  and  may  have  their  energy  companies  on  their  delegations,  while  Northern  governments  will  have  far  more  capacity  and  no  need  for  them  on  delegations  but  will  have  fully  consulted  them  beforehand;  • Parts  of  the  climate  justice  movement  have  already  rejected  the  UNFCCC  space  as  it  has  failed  to  deliver  and  is  technocratising  the  debate,  distancing  it  from  local  struggles  and  playing  into  the  hands  of  big  business  by  focusing  on  accounting,  measurements  and  markets  rather  than  drivers;  • Most  dirty  energy  lobbying  takes  place  in  the  capitals,  before  negotiators  and  delegations  arrive  (although  there  is  plenty  of  overt  capture,  from  side  events  to  sponsorship  to  parallel  summits)  and  the  UNFCCC  is  a  symptom  rather  than  a  cause  of  the  increasing  proximity  between  the  dirty  energy  industry  and  climate  policy  (although  certain  key  personalities  within  the  Secretariat  and  the  UN  are  also  driving  this  phenomenon);  • Paris  2015  is  likely  to  be  a  disaster  from  a  climate  perspective,  and  an  incredibly  fraught  and  tense  negotiation,  with  a  huge  battle  over  who  is  responsible  for  the  failure  (North  or  South);  • Fossil  fuels  are  far  more  integral  to  local  and  global  economies  than  tobacco  (both  the  revenues  and  their  use  as  a  form  of  energy),  and  are  seen  as  a  tool  for  development  by  many  countries  in  the  global  South  in  the  absence  of  external  39  support  (finance  and  technology  to  allow  for  an  alternative  development  pathway).  Therefore,  taking  these  factors  into  consideration,  the  campaign  must  not:  • Weaken  the  UNFCCC  process  itself  any  further,  due  to  its  unique  character;  • Undermine  the  wider  fight  for  equity  and  ambition  by  undermining  Southern  champions  in  an  international  space,  thereby  playing  into  the  hands  of  the  real  climate  criminals,  Northern  countries  with  historic  responsibility  and  major  fossil  fuel  interests  and  industries;71  • Be  used  as  a  campaign  against  Southern  governments  with  fossil  fuel  interests,  but  rather  empower  all  governments  to  increase  their  political  control  over  said  interests,  rather  than  allowing  them  to  set  policy;  • Make  overly-­‐strong  demands  on  the  UNFCCC  by  Paris  as  they  will  not  be  met;  instead  demands  must  build  after  Paris,  using  it  to  rebuild  momentum  after  potential  failure;  • Allow  demands  to  die  in  the  UNFCCC;  for  example  making  a  demand  of  the  COP21  Presidency  (François  Hollande)  also  contributes  to  the  French  national  campaign  and  can  continue  after;  • Exclude  groups  who  do  not  work  on  the  UNFCCC;  therefore  it  should  equally  focus  on  national  and  regional  levels  and  look  to  build  a  diverse  coalition  that  will  last  far  beyond  Paris.  71  Talking  to  Southern  climate  justice  groups,  there  is  a  view  that  they  will  hold  their  governments  to  account  in  national  spaces,  but  want  to  refrain  from  attacking  them  within  the  UNFCCC  as  this  plays  into  the  hands  of  Northern  countries  who  are  attempting  to  move  the  climate  regime  towards  an  inequitable  and  unambitious  outcome.  There  is  also  a  question  of  legitimacy,  and  Southern  groups,  aware  of  national  contexts,  should  be  leading  on  this.  How  can  we  use  COP21  in  Paris  as  an  opportunity  to  lay  the  groundwork  and  build  the  political  and  public  support  for  an  “Article  5.3“  policy  for  the  climate?  Objectives  • To  create  public  acceptance  that  the  dirty  energy  lobby  has  no  place  in  climate  policy  making  • To  have  the  dirty  energy  industry  blamed  for  the  failure  of  the  talks  due  to  their  influence  on  the  positions  and  politics  of  Northern  governments  • To  force  the  UNFCCC  to  reconsider  its  relationship  with  the  dirty  energy  lobby  • To  create  external  political  acceptance  outside  of  the  UNFCCC  that  the  dirty  energy  lobby  has  no  place  in  climate  policy  making  • To  build  a  strong,  robust  coalition  to  take  this  work  forward  after  Paris  Strategy  up  to  and  including  COP21  in  Paris  The  main  strategy  will  be  a  simple  three-­‐step  strategy:  1. Name,  shame  and  toxify  the  dirty  energy  lobby  (climate  criminals)  2. Expose/scandalise  their  close  association  with  our  political  leaders  and  climate  policy  making  (national/regional  governments  and  UNFCCC)  3. Demand  an  end  to  the  relationship  1.  Name,  shame  and  toxify  the  dirty  energy  lobby  (climate  criminals)  Choose  strategically  relevant  corporations  (depending  on  the  political  moment  –  see  below)  and  show  their  destructive  impact  (on  the  climate,  communities  and  their  environments),  their  refusal  to  take  real  action  (and  instead  promote  false  solutions,  40  which  they  benefit  from),  and  their  close  relationship  to  our  political  leaders/climate  policy  makers.  This  will  be  done  through  new  research  or  re-­‐packaging  existing  materials  (and  building  on  existing  campaigns).  Picking  well-­‐known  iconic  dirty  energy  corporations,  who  can  act  as  exemplars  for  their  industry,  makes  this  stage  far  shorter,  and  means  the  public  will  be  far  readier  to  take  the  next  step  (undermining  their  legitimacy  in  climate  policy).  • Ban  Ki-­‐moon  Summit:  the  dirtiest,  most  obvious  corporations  to  pledge  (and  those  with  the  most  contradictory  pledges  in  relation  to  their  core  business)  • COP20,  Lima:  those  operating  in  Latin  America  (new  research  will  be  produced  for  this)  • COP21,  Paris:  global,  but  relevant  for  the  French  context  • National  level:  those  relevant  to  the  struggles  of  local  groups  2.  Expose/scandalise  their  close  association  with  our  political  leaders  and  climate  policy-­‐  making  (national/regional  governments  and  UNFCCC)  This  will  be  done  through  a  simple  demand  for  transparency  around  the  interactions  between  our  political  leaders,  their  institutions  and  the  chosen  dirty  energy  corporation(s).  Such  a  demand  allows  many  groups  of  all  persuasions  to  get  behind  it,  as  well  as  being  difficult  for  a  public  institution  and  figure  to  argue  with.  It  will  be  a  dual-­‐  demand:  • Direct  interactions,  e.g.  publicly  disclosing  all  meetings  (and  minutes)  and  public  encounters  now  and  in  the  future  with  said  dirty  energy  corporation(s);  disclosing  their  funding  of  trips,  visits  or  public/private  events,  including  non-­‐  financial  contributions;  • Financial  benefits  received  by  the  corporation,  e.g.  publicly  disclosing  all  subsidies,  tax-­‐breaks,  research  funding  and  grants;  The  political  targets  will  be  at  international,  national  and  regional  level:  International  level  (UNFCCC)  To  avoid  attacking  the  process  itself,  the  campaign  could  use  public  figures  as  proxies,  who  can  be  held  up  as  the  guardians  of  the  integrity  of  the  process  and  of  climate  policy  making,  as  well  as  drivers  of  the  increasing  corporate  capture.  Demands  for  transparency  will  be  made  of:  - UNFCCC  Secretariat  (via  Christiana  Figueres,  UNFCCC  Executive-­‐Secretary):  full  disclosure  of  all  interactions  with  selected  dirty  energy  corporations  on  behalf  of  her  and  her  secretariat.  She  is  sensitive  around  maintaining  a  positive  image,  and  in  Warsaw  was  heavily  criticised  for  choosing  to  speak  at  a  coal  summit  organised  alongside  the  climate  talks,  as  well  as  choosing  it  instead  of  speaking  at  a  youth  conference  (she  was  presented  an  ultimatum).  - COP  Presidency  (via  Ollanta  Humala  and  then  François  Hollande,  Peruvian  and  French  Presidents  respectively):  full  disclosure  of  all  interactions  with  selected  dirty  energy  corporations  on  behalf  of  him  and  his  COP  Presidency  team.  Humala  is  being  heavily  criticised  for  new  regulations  in  favour  of  extractive  companies,  while  Hollande  is  championing  nuclear  energy.  - Green  Climate  Fund  (via  Héla  Cheikhrouhou,  Executive  Director):  full  disclosure  of  all  interactions  with  selected  dirty  energy  corporations  on  behalf  of  41  her,  her  staff,  GCF  board  members,  committees  and  panels.  National/Regional  level  A  campaign  tool  kit  could  be  provided  for  interested  groups  which  can  help  add  a  national-­‐level  demand  to  local  dirty  energy  struggles,  whether  in  the  global  North  or  South,  challenging  the  relationship  between  their  governments  and  their  dirty  energy  industries.72  Making  the  link  in  early  2015  with  the  trade  talks  (TTIP/TAFTA,  TPP)  would  also  allow  another  dimension  to  show  how  our  governments  are  handing  over  climate  policy  to  corporations  via  mechanisms  like  the  investor-­‐to-­‐state  dispute  settlement  mechanism  (date  tbc).  However,  to  ensure  this  campaign  compliments  the  fight  for  climate  justice  within  the  UNFCCC  negotiations  and  maintains  international  pressure  on  those  historically  responsible  for  climate  change  (who  are  preventing  us  reaching  a  just,  equitable  and  ambitious  deal),  the  campaign  coalition  will  collectively  target  specific  Northern  polluters  and  their  close  relationship  to  their  dirty  energy  industries:  - USA  - Canada  - Australia  - EU  Demands  of  transparency  regarding  the  interaction  between  these  countries  and  dirty  energy  corporations  will  be  made  at  strategic  moments  between  now  and  Paris  by  both  national-­‐level  groups  and  the  coalition,  providing  the  ammunition  to  scandalise  the  relationships  and  allow  the  third  phase.  These  72  Or  groups  who  are  fighting  for  clean-­‐energy  but  see  the  power  of  the  fossil  fuel  industry  as  blocking  them  will  also  expose  how  dirty  energy  corporations  are  influencing  the  positions  of  historic  polluters  and  preventing  a  deal.  3.  Demand  an  end  to  the  close  relationship  As  this  campaign-­‐plan  aims  to  build  public  and  political  support  for  the  need  for  a  5.3  for  climate,  an  end  to  the  relationship  before  Paris  is  unrealistic,  but  after  the  failure  of  Paris  due  to  the  dirty  energy  industry,  these  demands  will  be  taken  far  more  seriously.  Combining  the  information  revealed  in  phase  two  with  the  clear  evidence  of  how  harmful  these  dirty  energy  corporations  are  –  as  well  as  the  strong  example  of  tobacco  –  demands  for  an  end  to  the  cosy  relationship  can  be  made  at  all  levels.  These  demands  will  be  made  during  2015,  with  particular  pressure  as  the  COP21  approaches:  • UNFCCC  Secretariat  (via  Christiana  Figueres):  Her  and  her  staff  refuse  to  meet  the  dirty  energy  lobby  in  the  run-­‐up  to  COP21;  undertake  a  review  of  measures  to  protect  her  office  and  the  UNFCCC  (as  a  UN  agency)  from  the  undue  and  damaging  influence  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby  (this  includes  the  direct  involvement  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby  within  the  talks)  • COP  Presidency  (via  François  Hollande):  Him  and  his  staff  refuse  to  meet  the  dirty  energy  lobby  in  the  run-­‐up  to  COP21;  undertake  review  of  measures  to  protect  his  and  all  future  COP  Presidencies  from  the  undue  and  damaging  influence  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby  (this  covers  sponsorship  and  wider  dirty  energy  involvement)  • An  additional  demand  to  make  for  groups  working  on  the  inside  could  be  that  the  42  selected  corporations  should  simply  not  be  allowed  into  the  negotiations  (contrasting  with  the  expulsion  of  youth  delegates  at  COP19)  • The  possibility  of  a  ‘resolution’  or  some  concrete  demand  that  could  be  used  to  build  on  in  the  future  (e.g.  ‘the  COP  recognises  the  potentially  damaging  influence  of  dirty  energy  corporations  on  the  decision  making  processes  of  governments  and  the  UN  on  climate’).  TBC  • Green  Climate  Fund  (via  Héla  Cheikhrouhou):  She  and  her  staff  refuse  to  meet  the  dirty  energy  lobby;  undertake  review  of  measures  to  protect  the  GCF  from  the  undue  and  damaging  influence  of  the  dirty  energy  lobby  (this  covers  sponsorship  and  wider  dirty  energy  involvement)  • Additional  demand  for  climate  finance  groups:  the  GCF  should  not  fund  any  dirty  energy  (particularly  fossil  fuel)  projects,  while  fossil  fuel  company,  association,  or  financier/funder  cannot  fill  Private  Sector  Active  Observer  seats  nor  serve  on  GCF  panels,  committees  or  advisory  groups  The  campaign  will  also  aim  to  attract  governments  who  may  be  supportive  at  national  level  (e.g.  a  small  island  state  dependent  on  fossil  fuel  imports)  National  level  National  campaigns  should  demand  their  governments  to  a)  end  all  interactions  with  relevant  corporations  and  b)  end  all  financial  support.  However,  a  more  concrete  demand  would  be  asking  for  an  action  plan  to  show  how  they  intend  to  protect  national-­‐level  climate  policy  making  from  the  undue  and  damaging  influence  of  the  dirty  energy  industry.  However,  each  campaign  will  have  different  capacities,  needs  and  demands.  Collectively,  the  coalition  will  make  similar  demands  of  Northern  historical  polluters.  Outlined  is  just  one  option  of  how  to  deliver  such  a  campaign  and  build  public  pressure.  But  through  collective  ownership  and  a  diversity  of  strategies  and  tactics  suited  to  local  contexts,  we  will  be  able  to  end  the  cosy  relationship  between  the  dirty  energy  lobby  and  our  politicians  43  New  Movement  Strategies  Jim  Shultz  Editors’  note:  We  provide  here  three  articles  that  report  and  analyze  the  strategies  of  the  global  climate  justice  movement,  written  between  August  and  November  2014  by  Jim  Shultz,  founder  and  executive  director  of  The  Democracy  Center  and  lives  in  Cochabamba,  Bolivia.  They  are  based  in  part  on  a  much  larger  report,  “Movement  Strategies  for  Moving  Mountains:  Conversations  with  Activists  Worldwide  on  How  to  Use  Latin  America’s  COP  to  Build  Citizen  Action  on  Climate,”  prepared  by  The  Democracy  Center.

The  citizens’  movement  for  action  on  the  global  climate  crisis  has,  over  time,  developed  a  love-­‐hate  relationship  with  international  campaigning.  For  years,  people  from  all  over  the  planet  have  joined  together  across  national  boundaries  to  address  a  crisis  that  knows  no  such  boundaries.  The  climate  movement  is  stepping  back  into  the  international  arena  once  again  The  vision  they  created  had  an  appeal  that  was  both  romantic  and  strategic  at  the  same  time.  The  high  point  for  this  “one  planet,  one  people”  activism  was  in  2009,  when  activists  descended  on  the  Danish  capital  of  Copenhagen  by  the  tens  of  thousands  to  push  for  action  at  the  U.N.’s  annual  COP  (Conference  of  the  Parties)  summit,  with  hopes  for  a  global  deal  as  serious  and  real  as  the  climate  threat  itself  (some  activists  dubbed  the  meeting  “Hopenhagen”).  Those  activist  hopes  crashed,  however,  against  the  unchanged  political  realities  of  narrow  national  interest,  powerful  corporate  resistance,  complex  issues,  and  a  lack  of  political  will.  Many  climate  campaigners  reacted  by  returning  to  their  countries  and  focusing  their  energies  instead  on  political  battles  closer  to  home,  such  as  the  fight  over  the  Keystone  XL  pipeline  in  the  U.S.  and  anti-­‐  fracking  efforts  in  Europe.  By  the  time  the  most  recent  COP  negotiations  were  held  in  Warsaw  last  December,  the  process  had  become  almost  completely  ignored  by  the  larger  public.  Now,  in  a  three-­‐step  dance  that  begins  on  the  streets  of  New  York  City  in  September,  the  climate  movement  is  stepping  back  into  the  international  arena  once  again.  United  Nations  Secretary  General  Ban  Ki-­‐Moon,  who  has  made  climate  change  a  main  issue  of  his  44  tenure,  has  called  the  planet’s  heads  of  state  and  other  “world  leaders”  to  a  special  “Climate  Week”  summit  aimed  at  increasing  the  pressure  for  coordinated  international  action.  Knowing  what  you  want  and  knowing  how  to  change  the  political  equation  are  two  different  things.  Climate  advocacy  organizations  in  the  U.S.  have  been  mobilizing  for  months  to  seize  the  opportunity  with  plans  for  a  massive  march  through  the  streets  of  Manhattan  on  September  21.  In  December,  this  renewed  energy  for  international  action  will  turn  southward  to  Peru,  where  the  COP  negotiations  will  convene  in  the  political  shadow  of  melting  Andean  glaciers.  Then  in  December  of  next  year  the  COP  negotiations  will  move  to  Paris  for  what  is  supposed  to  be  the  deadline  for  a  new  international  climate  accord.  European  activists  are  already  meeting  to  organize  a  mobilization  in  the  streets  there  to  match  or  surpass  the  multitude  expected  in  New  York  next  month.  As  the  climate  movement  steps  forward  once  again  into  the  arena  of  international  politics,  it  suffers  no  shortage  of  demands  and  proposals.  Climate  groups  can  offer  up  a  diversity  of  ambitious  and  passionate  plans  for  how  to  reduce  humanity’s  use  of  fossil  fuels,  protect  the  world’s  forests,  and  move  money  from  the  rich  countries  that  have  caused  the  crisis  to  the  poor  ones  least  equipped  to  deal  with  what’s  coming.  But  knowing  what  you  want  and  knowing  how  to  change  the  political  equation  to  make  that  possible  are  two  different  things.  The  Democracy  Center  recently  interviewed  more  than  40  key  climate  activists  from  across  five  continents  to  seek  their  views  on  how  to  use  the  Lima  summit  and  these  other  global  gatherings  as  an  opportunity  to  alter  the  political  winds  around  the  climate  crisis  and  make  real  action  more  possible.  What  we  heard,  from  people  ranging  from  local  indigenous  activists  to  staff  at  well-­‐known  NGOs,  were  three  important  strands  of  collective  wisdom.  First,  change  the  global  narrative  about  the  climate  crisis.  Climate  activists  have  bounced  for  a  decade  from  one  way  of  talking  about  the  crisis  to  another.  We  have  heard  about  polar  bears  and  sea  rise,  mutant  storms  and  parts  per  billion  of  carbon  in  the  atmosphere  –  none  of  it  sufficiently  connected  to  people’s  daily  lives  to  gain  hard  and  lasting  traction.  But  there  are  lessons  from  the  grassroots  about  how  to  do  better.  In  California,  climate  activists  successfully  fought  back  a  political  assault  by  the  Koch  brothers  by  talking  about  local  fossil  fuel  plants  and  their  connection  to  asthma  among  children.  In  South  America  the  crisis  is  about  water  –  the  disappearance  of  it  in  some  places  causing  drought  and  displacement,  and  too  much  of  it  in  other  places  causing  flooding  and  destruction.  In  Asia  and  Africa,  people  talk  about  climate’s  role  in  a  worsening  food  crisis.  Getting  real  action  on  climate  is  about  political  power.  The  common  thread  in  the  messages  that  are  winning  support  is  to  speak  locally  and  connect  the  climate  crisis  to  real  issues  of  life,  survival,  and  the  diminished  and  more  dangerous  planet  we  are  getting  ready  to  leave  to  our  children  and  theirs.  Just  as  important  as  the  message  is  the  moral  authority  of  those  who  deliver  it.  “We  can’t  talk  about  the  impacts  unless  the  main  45  message  comes  from  the  affected  communities,”  says  Juan  Carlos  Soriano,  a  Peruvian  activist  with  350.org.  Second,  use  this  trilogy  of  global  actions  to  build  the  long-­‐term  power  of  the  climate  movement.  Getting  real  action  on  climate  is  not  just  about  raising  consciousness;  it  is  about  political  power  and  how  the  climate  movement  can  build  muscle.  In  New  York  and  Paris  the  focus  will  be  on  getting  multitudes  into  the  streets  in  the  hope  of  convincing  governments  that  they  ignore  a  rising  demand  for  action  at  their  political  peril.  “What  we  most  need  to  do  as  a  movement  is  move  the  conversation  and  build  power,  not  lobby  global  leaders,”  observes  Sean  Sweeney  of  the  Global  Labor  Institute.  In  Latin  America,  Africa,  and  Asia  that  citizen  power  resides  in  long-­‐established  movements  on  the  ground  tied  to  indigenous  rights,  territorial  rights,  natural  resources,  and  other  battles  that  are  now  impacted  by  climate  change.  Sandwiched  in  between  the  higher  profile,  Northern-­‐dominated  events  in  New  York  and  Paris,  activists  we  spoke  with  said  that  the  COP  in  Lima  must  stand  out  as  the  “COP  of  the  South”  and  make  the  link  between  the  climate  crisis  and  these  movements.  “The  local  struggles  seem  to  be  in  compartmentalized  spaces  that  don’t  connect  to  this  big  issue  that  affects  absolutely  everything.  One  of  the  challenges  is  to  connect  the  local  struggles  and  demands  with  activism  on  climate  change,”  says  Elizabeth  Peredo  Beltran,  a  well-­‐regarded  climate  leader  in  Bolivia.  The  path  through  New  York,  Lima,  and  Paris  offers  a  chance  to  engage  new  communities.  Third,  directly  confront  the  powers  and  forces  blocking  serious  action  on  the  climate  crisis.  Fossil  fuel  companies,  international  agribusiness,  automobile  manufacturers,  and  other  corporate  interests  have  a  huge  stake  in  international  climate  negotiations  and  have  used  their  political  muscle  to  embed  themselves  in  the  U.N.’s  COP  process.  During  the  meeting  in  Warsaw  last  year,  the  Corporate  Europe  Observatory  documented  all  kinds  of  techniques  used  by  these  corporations  to  become  official  sponsors  of  global  climate  negotiations  the  way  they  might  make  themselves  sponsors  of  the  Olympics  or  World  Cup.  Corporations  furnished  government  negotiators  with  everything  from  free  cars  and  drivers  to  logo-­‐  emblazoned  drinking  cups,  all  the  while  pushing  their  agendas  on  issues  such  as  coal  capture  technology  and  corporate-­‐driven  carbon  markets.  Activists  say  it  is  urgent  to  put  a  spotlight  on  this  corporate  capture  of  the  negotiations  and  on  the  false  solutions  corporations  have  used  their  access  to  promote.  “We  need  to  go  in  with  an  offensive  strategy  and  communicate  the  message  that  the  negotiations  are  focusing  on  the  wrong  issues  –  the  real  solutions  are  about  redesigning  the  economy,”  says  Nathan  Thanki  of  the  European  group  Earth  in  Brackets.  Sun  Tzu  wrote  in  The  Art  of  War  that  “strategy  without  tactics  is  the  slowest  route  to  victory  and  tactics  without  strategy  is  the  noise  before  defeat.”  It  is  good  news  in  the  world  of  climate  activism  that  movements  and  organizations  are  taking  up  anew  the  46  demand  for  serious  action  at  the  international  level.  While  it  is  highly  doubtful  that  countries  like  the  U.S.,  China,  India,  and  others  would  ever  bind  their  domestic  policies  to  a  global  agreement,  international  action  can  increase  the  pressure  on  these  governments  to  act.  As  with  all  successful  citizen  movements,  that  begins  with  building  a  solid,  committed,  and  mobilized  base  among  those  already  committed  to  action.  But  the  climate  movement  must  also  win  support  from  the  corners  of  citizenry  that  are  not  yet  engaged  and  not  yet  persuaded  behind  a  common  agenda  for  what  needs  to  be  done.  The  path  through  New  York,  Lima,  and  Paris  offers  a  chance  to  do  that  –  if  we  speak  about  the  crisis  in  a  way  that  connects  with  people,  if  we  use  every  opportunity  to  gather  as  a  chance  to  build  power  and  not  just  blow  off  steam,  and  if  we  unmask,  challenge,  and  undermine  the  larger  forces  that  stand  in  the  way.  With  so  much  at  stake  for  the  generations  who  will  follow  us  on  this  planet,  it  is  essential  that  the  next  round  of  global  climate  action  be  something  far  more  than  just  “the  noise  before  defeat.”  International  Climate  Activism:  The  Second  Coming  Jim  Shultz  August  29,  2014    climate-­‐activism-­‐the-­‐second-­‐coming/  The  Democracy  Center  has  just  released  our  report  on  the  first  phase  of  a  project  looking  at  the  opportunities  which  renewed  energy  in  international  negotiations  –  and  renewed  activist  energies  –  can  provide  for  strategy-­‐  building  within  the  climate  movement.  A  version  of  this  article  was  also  published  in  Yes!  Magazine  The  citizen  movement  for  action  on  the  global  climate  crisis  has,  over  time,  developed  a  love-­‐hate  relationship  with  international  campaigning.

The  path  through  New  York,  Lima  and  Paris  offers  a  chance  to  do  that  –  if  we  speak  about  the  crisis  in  a  way  that  connects  with  people,  if  we  use  every  opportunity  to  gather  as  a  chance  to  build  power  and  not  just  blow  off  steam,  and  if  we  unmask,  challenge,  and  undermine  the  larger  forces  that  stand  in  the  way.  With  so  much  at  stake  for  the  generations  who  will  follow  us  on  this  planet,  it  is  essential  that  the  next  round  of  global  climate  action  be  something  far  more  than  just  “the  noise  before  defeat.”  Time  for  a  New  Containment  Strategy?  What  Climate  Marchers  Can  Learn  from  the  Cold  War  Jim  Shultz  September  29,  2014    hands/time-­‐for-­‐a-­‐new-­‐containment-­‐strategy-­‐  what-­‐the-­‐climate-­‐movement-­‐cold-­‐war  The  leading  strategies  in  the  climate  justice  movement  already  resemble  the  Cold  War  policies  of  containment,  roll-­‐back,  and  isolation.  But  can  they  wear  down  the  political  power  of  the  fossil  fuel  industry?  This  story  is  part  of  the  Climate  In  Our  Hands  collaboration  between  Truthout  and  YES!  Magazine.  More  than  400,000  people  jammed  the  streets  of  Manhattan  on  September  21,  drawn  from  all  parts  by  the  magnetic  force  of  the  People’s  Climate  March.

Square  to  the  upper  reaches  of  Central  Park  West,  a  40-­‐block  sea  of  humanity  joined  under  banners  that  demanded  action,  named  the  responsible,  and  articulated  the  solutions.  Most  moving  of  all  were  those  that  expressed  the  fears  and  hopes  of  the  children  who  drew  50  and  carried  them.  For  those  fortunate  enough  to  be  there,  it  was  a  deeply  empowering  experience.  The  People’s  March  was  not  about  demands  that  lacked  the  power  to  force  action.  That  said,  Climate  Week  in  New  York  –  the  march,  the  special  U.N.  summit  that  catalyzed  it,  and  the  swirl  of  side  events  surrounding  both  –  was  about  far  more  than  a  one-­‐time  gathering  of  the  masses.  Its  true  value  lay  in  the  millions  of  conversations  it  spawned  among  the  citizens  who  committed  their  presence  to  the  battle.  Some  of  these  conversations  came  in  organized  forums  but  most  were  spontaneous,  between  strangers  on  the  street  or  old  friends  reunited  around  a  table.  It  was  in  these  conversations  that  people  dug  for  deeper  insight  into  the  challenge  we  face  and  where  we  go  now  as  a  movement.  Many  of  those  conversations  were  about  hope.  Just  hours  off  my  long  plane  ride  to  New  York  from  Bolivia,  I  stood  before  an  auditorium  of  students  at  Brooklyn  College,  young  people  who  spoke  of  the  future  with  fear  and  concern.  Many  of  them  had  their  introduction  to  the  climate  issue  during  Hurricane  Sandy,  an  experience  of  vulnerability  still  fresh  in  their  minds.  Finding  hope  may  be  more  essential  on  climate  than  on  any  other  crisis  we  face.  War,  genocide,  disease,  and  injustice  –  dire  as  they  are  –  have  “off  switches”  that  history  has  shown  us  before.  Barbarians  fall,  governments  make  peace,  vaccines  are  discovered.  We  don’t  know  if  the  climate  crisis  has  an  off  switch,  even  if  we  do  muster  powerful  global  citizen  action.  “Let’s  be  honest,”  said  a  woman  in  the  audience  at  one  of  the  forums  where  I  spoke.  “It  is  OK  for  us  to  be  here  just  to  recharge  our  batteries  for  the  battles  ahead.”  A  basic  principle  that  is  both  big  enough  to  make  a  difference  and  simple  to  understand:  “Leave  it  in  the  ground.”  I  saw  that  hope  over  and  over  again  in  small  ways:  in  Christina,  the  young  muralist  I  met  on  a  corner  in  SoHo,  painting  a  banner  for  the  march.  I  saw  it  in  Raymond,  an  engineer  from  Alaska  who  flew  to  New  York  to  participate  in  the  first  political  action  of  his  life.  “It  seemed  like  an  opportunity  to  do  something,”  he  told  me.  In  our  large  numbers,  we  saw  glimpses  of  a  people  rising  and  we  need  that.  But  there  were  many,  many  other  conversations  about  what  must  come  after  the  March,  about  goals,  power,  tactics,  and  the  missing  connection  between  each  of  those:  strategy.  I  heard  familiar  criticisms  of  the  March.  Michael  Dorsey,  a  20-­‐year  veteran  of  U.N.  and  NGO  work  who  spoke  on  a  panel  alongside  me,  chastised  350.org  leader  Bill  McKibben  as  he  listened  to  us,  saying  the  weekend’s  action  lacked  a  clear  message  beyond  “Do  something!”  “Brother  Bill,”  he  said,  “I  will  not  march  with  you  tomorrow.  I  will  not  join  in  a  march  that  has  no  demands.”  But  the  People’s  Climate  March  was  not  about  demands  that  lacked  the  power  to  force  action.  It  was  about  building  a  base  for  action  wide  enough  to  connect  Brooklyn  families  pushing  strollers  to  the  anti-­‐  51  capitalists  who  got  arrested  at  Flood  Wall  Street  the  next  day.  I  have  been  in  gatherings  like  this  one  before:  the  People’s  Climate  Summit  in  Bolivia  in  2010;  the  activist  assembly  at  Rio  20  in  2012;  and  others.  I  am  continually  amazed  at  the  energy  invested  –  and  wasted  –  in  these  spaces  as  the  movement’s  intellectuals  polish  theories  that  no  one  outside  the  movement  understands;  as  the  various  coalitions  polish  their  passionate  declarations  that  no  one  will  read.  Absent  always  is  genuine  debate  about  how  we  make  any  of  it  actually  happen.  And  in  this  way  the  debates  around  the  People’s  Climate  March  seemed,  for  the  most  part,  no  different.  Finding  hope  may  be  more  essential  on  climate  than  on  any  other  crisis  we  face.  On  Sunday  evening  people  gathered  in  gaggles  to  take  stock  of  what  they  had  just  been  a  part  of.  I  had  the  fortune  to  have  that  after-­‐march  conversation  over  Chinese  take-­‐  out  in  the  Harlem  apartment  of  someone  who  has  written  extensively  about  these  kinds  of  questions  for  many  decades:  City  University  of  New  York  professor  Frances  Fox  Piven.  An  avid  scholar  of  (and  participant  in)  people’s  movements  since  the  1960s,  Piven  listened  and  then  offered  a  simple  truth  that  has  run  through  every  key  social  movement  of  the  past  hundred  years:  Persuasion  through  words  is  not  enough.  We  have  to  find  the  levers  of  real  power,  and  then  reach  and  seize  them.  Marching  en  masse  alongside  Central  Park  and  blocking  lower  Broadway  the  next  day  may  have  raised  our  voices,  but  it  brought  neither  shudders  nor  changes  of  course  on  Wall  Street  or  in  the  U.N.  assembly.  But  among  the  many  who  gathered  in  New  York  this  past  week,  among  the  activists  who  carry  the  fight  forward,  there  is  a  good  deal  of  solid  thinking  about  how  we  move  from  inspiration  to  real  strategy.  Around  the  world,  there  is  a  gathering  around  a  basic  principle  that  is  both  big  enough  to  make  a  difference  and  simple  to  understand:  “Leave  the  oil,  gas,  and  coal  in  the  ground.”  Over  cheap  Mexican  food  at  a  sticky  table  in  Brooklyn,  I  listened  to  my  old  friend  and  fearless  activist  Antonia  Juhasz.  She  began  battling  the  oil  industry  years  before  the  practice  came  into  vogue,  writing  widely  read  books  and  getting  arrested  at  a  Chevron  shareholder  meeting  in  Texas.  She  had  just  returned  from  a  submarine  trip  to  the  bottom  of  the  Gulf  of  Mexico  to  witness  the  destruction  of  the  sea  floor  wrought  by  BP’s  spilled  oil.  As  she  spoke  about  the  People’s  Climate  March,  I  began  to  recognize  a  strategy  that  was  old  and  familiar:  containment.  For  five  decades,  this  was  the  geopolitical  strategy  that  the  U.S.  aimed  at  Soviet  Communism  –  don’t  let  it  spread,  roll  it  back  where  you  can,  and  support  those  actions  that  will  hasten  it  collapsing  of  its  own  weight.  Even  if  we  have  not  articulated  it  as  such,  that  is  our  strategy  today  against  the  threat  of  fossil  fuels.  The  battles  against  fracking  are  about  containing  the  spread  of  the  drilling.  The  battles  against  existing  coal  plants  are  about  rolling  it  back.  The  battles  for  divestment  are  aimed  at  making  the  industry  52  a  political  pariah,  akin  to  tobacco,  to  diminish  its  political  clout.  The  hope  is  that  the  move  toward  energy  and  transportation  alternatives,  combined  with  divestment,  will  loosen  fossil  fuels’  grip  over  the  political  and  economic  territory  the  industry  holds  now,  and  hasten  its  collapse.  The  march’s  true  value  lay  in  the  millions  of  conversations  it  spawned.  We  also  know  that  our  political  clout  against  the  industry  is  strongest  closest  to  our  communities,  and  that  those  are  the  battlefields  we  must  drag  the  fight  to.  Victories  against  the  Koch  brothers  in  California,  against  fracking  efforts  in  New  York,  and  others  show  us  what  strategy  and  victory  look  like.  As  I  stood  in  the  crowd  during  the  march,  I  heard  a  chorus  of  unfamiliar  voices  chanting  my  name.  “Hey  Jim,  we  came,  we  came!”  A  group  of  the  students  I  had  spoken  to  days  earlier  at  Brooklyn  College  had  heeded  my  pleas  and  had  given  up  their  precious  Sunday  to  join  the  march.  They  were  all  smiles  as  they  walked.  This  is  where  hope  comes  from.  This  is  what  the  People’s  Climate  March  was  really  about.  Now  we  must  make  sure  that  the  march  does  not  end  on  Eleventh  Avenue,  where  we  all  went  our  separate  ways,  but  that  it  continues  on  across  continents  and  countries  in  a  way  that  can  go  beyond  talking  about  our  fears,  demands,  and  dreams  to  also  make  a  serious  difference.  53  Integrate  and  Escalate  Nathan  Thanki  What  strategies  and  tactics  should  the  climate  justice  movement  adopt,  both  inside  and  outside  the  U.N.  negotiations  (known  as  the  COP,  or  Conference  of  the  Parties),  to  create  maximum  pushback  against  the  status  quo  of  unfettered  carbon-­‐fuelled  capitalism,  and  to  ensure  that  the  United  Nations'  next  universal  climate  treaty,  to  be  adopted  at  the  COP  21  Paris  talks  in  December  2015,  leads  the  world  away  from  its  current  destination  of  global  climate  apartheid  and  toward  climate  justice?  These  are  not  new  questions  and  neither  are  my  answers.  I  don’t  assume  to  have  the  experience  or  intelligence  to  be  able  to  outline  any  grand  strategies  to  achieve  climate  justice,  but  I  will  humbly  offer  some  ideas  (the  list  is  definitely  not  exhaustive)  that  may  contribute  to  getting  us  on  the  way.  Integrate  and  escalate  with  other  struggles  For  being  such  a  cross-­‐cutting  issue,  climate  change  is  oddly  isolated  and  most  of  the  people  from  mainstream  groups  that  self-­‐  identify  as  being  part  of  a  climate  [justice]  movement  have  become  stranded  in  the  increasingly  apolitical,  click-­‐bait  work  of  online  “communications,”  or  in  the  obscure  depths  of  national  or  international  policy.  I  don’t  say  this  to  denigrate  this  work  –  it  is  essential  and  somebody  must  do  it  –  but  just  to  question  if  the  compartmentalization  of  activism  and  further  specialization  within  climate  change  activism  has  led  us  to  lose  sight  of  the  bigger  picture.  One  thing  many  who  organize  around  climate  change  have  pointed  out  is  that  apart  from  during  extreme  weather  events,  it  is  very  hard  to  make  climate  change  (the  abstract  concept)  real  for  people  in  a  way  that  will  radicalize  and  mobilize  them.  We  need  to  ask:  what  issues  do  radicalize  and  mobilize  people?  Of  those  issues,  which  ones  are  really  the  same  fight  as  the  climate  fight,  and  which  ones  are  struggles  in  need  of  solidarity  and  support?  In  my  mind,  the  best  way  forward  for  the  climate  movement  is  to  connect  with  the  struggles  that  matter  to  people:  land,  food,  energy,  extraction,  water,  health,  transport,  development,  or  some  combination  of  many  issues.  This  doesn’t  mean  adopting  the  bad-­‐ally  habits  of  doing  things  like  showing  up  at  Ferguson  shouting  about  climate  change.73  Nobody  wants  that.  That  isn’t  helpful.  What  it  does  means  is  a  lot  of  hard,  humble,  solidarity  work.  Many  groups  are  of  course  already  doing  this  and  more  connections  between  struggles  are  being  made  every  day  –  my  point  is  that  this  needs  to  become  the  norm  rather  than  the  exception.  At  least  in  the  English-­‐speaking  world,  the  Right  have  gained  so  much  ground  in  recent  years.  A  climate  [justice]  movement  that  doesn’t  recognize  this  as  a  major  problem  and  work  to  push  back  against  a  common  enemy  will  fail  to  achieve  any  of  its  objectives.  Use  diversity  as  strength  Part  of  the  reason  that  right-­‐wing  ideology  has  taken  over  the  mainstream  is  that  while  it  presents  a  broadly  united  front,  the  left  is  utterly  fractured.  That’s  not  news  to  anyone,  I  know,  but  then  why  do  we  remain  so?  Stuart  Hall  talked  about  the  need  to  foster  an  ability  to  live  with  difference.  To  work  together  through  our  differences  for  a  common  cause.  We  seem  to  be  finding  that  difficult.  Instead  of  building  our  counter-­‐cultures  and  constructing  a  new  cultural  hegemony  (that  is  negotiated)  we  are  caught  in  a  cycle  of  73  Just  want  to  be  really  clear  that  Deirdre  Smith’s  piece  for  350  was  a  really  good  articulation  of  how  racism  and  climate  justice  are  connected.  It  can  be  done,  but  doing  it  wrong  is  worse  than  not  trying  at  all.  54  imperialistic  activism  forcing  groups  to  maintain  at  all  costs  their  independence  to  such  an  extent  that  a  common  platform  or  agenda  becomes  impossible.  Why,  for  example,  do  we  spend  a  lot  of  time  dismissing  each  other’s  work?  Why  is  US  organizing  culture  the  dominant  one?  Among  groups  that  do  climate  justice  work  there  are  many  approaches,  but  sadly  rather  than  treating,  for  example,  Keystone,  the  WTO,  GMOs,  the  Green  Climate  Fund  and  fracking  as  different  fronts  of  the  same  war  we  treat  them  as  unrelated  or  competing  projects.  That’s  not  to  say  we  shouldn’t  recognize  the  different  utility  of  each  to  movement  building  (most  people  are  turned  on  by  stopping  a  new  extractive  project  rather  than  by  incremental  gains  in  international  law)  just  that  we  should  treat  them  all  as  part  of  the  same  overall  struggle.  Be  pragmatic  and  idealistic  at  the  same  time  In  spite  of  all  the  cynicism,  I  actually  think  many  activists  are  highly  idealistic.  To  the  point  of  it  being  a  burden  on  them,  their  work,  and  any  hopes  of  building  a  popular  movement  for  climate  justice.  If  we’re  to  have  any  hope  of  doing  that,  we’ll  need  to  leave  behind  some  of  our  notions  of  ideological  purity.  At  the  very  least  we  need  to  envision  the  way  forward  to  achieving  our  objectives  –  including  all  the  milestones  to  getting  there.  For  example,  the  People’s  Climate  March  in  September  2014  was  not  perfect.  I  think  everyone  centrally  involved  would  freely  admit  that.  But  some  of  the  public  criticism  of  the  mobilization  was  totally  unhelpful  –  especially  as  it  came  merely  days  beforehand  and  from  people  who  had  not  tried  to  collaborate  with  the  organizers  in  order  to  better  the  message/route/whatever  else  they  had  issue  with  in  the  preceding  months.  The  final  word  was  that  400,000  were  on  the  streets  of  New  York  for  climate  change.  Some  of  them  lacked  a  sharp  analysis  about  the  root  causes  of  the  crisis,  but  I  saw  many  people  who  were  clearly  protesting  neoliberal  capitalism.  You  can  have  all  the  analysis  you  like  and  spend  all  your  time  cynically  blogging  away,  but  unless  you’re  actually  doing  something  in  the  real  world  as  well,  you  appear  to  me  to  be  an  attention  seeker  more  concerned  with  their  own  ego  than  with  actually  building  bridges  and  the  type  of  movements  needed.  In  my  mind,  there’s  no  contradiction  in  having  ideals  that  are  not  lived  up  to  but  which  you  constantly  strive  for.  The  old  chestnut  “don’t  let  the  perfect  be  the  enemy  of  the  good”  rings  true.  Get  over  the  EGO  and  NGO  politics  As  mentioned,  a  huge  drag  on  movement  building  is  the  prevalence  of  some  massive  egos  and  the  persistence  of  NGO  in-­‐fighting  over  brand  recognition  and  funding.  Of  course  egos  exist  in  any  movement,  the  personal  is  always  political,  and  as  humans  we  are  not  purely  logical  (thankfully).  But  our  inability  to  overcome  or  at  least  live  with  certain  differences  of  opinion,  our  inclination  to  get  personal  when  things  get  heated,  and  the  pressure  to  advance  brands  rather  than  the  overall  movement  all  stand  in  the  way  of  ever  achieving  climate  justice.  As  a  species  we  seem  to  have  a  thing  for  leaders.  In  the  climate  movement(s),  the  urge  for  memes  and  trends  leads  us  to  splashing  certain  people’s  faces  and  words  all  over  the  internet,  but  then  we  get  annoyed  and  jealous  when  they  are  identified  by  the  media  as  leaders  or  spokespeople.  Leaders,  especially  charismatic  ones,  can  be  useful  –  to  a  point.  Within  the  movement(s)  we  have  to  recognize  and  exploit  the  strategic  potential  of  having  spokespeople  and  leaders,  but  55  everyone  should  remember  that  they  are  propelled  into  that  role  by  the  movement  in  order  to  serve  the  movement.  The  best  way  to  undermine  false  solutions  is  proposing  real  ones  I’m  not  one  for  the  “if  you  don’t  have  the  solution  you  should  just  keep  quiet”  attitude  which  is  often  used  to  dismiss  dissent,  but  I  do  think  that  not  having  solutions  –  clear  and  compelling  solutions  –  is  bad  strategy.  For  one,  it  makes  resisting  the  false  solutions  that  much  harder.  It  allows  the  cleverer  corporate  agents  a  drop  of  undeserved  legitimacy  as  they  muddy  the  water.  In  terms  of  the  2015  treaty,  what  possible  outcomes  could  be  anything  even  approaching  good  for  climate  justice?  What  real  solutions  stand  a  chance?  I  suspect  there’s  an  array  of  different  opinions,  but  that  most  of  them  hold  little  to  no  hope  of  anything  good  coming  out  of  2015.  Even  the  most  deluded  negotiators  would  probably  struggle  to  say  that  Paris  will  deliver  us  climate  justice  or  a  plan  to  get  it.  But  there  are  still  many  things  to  fight  for  (both  to  advance  and  to  prevent).  Agreeing  on  that  point,  though  basic,  would  be  a  start.  In  terms  of  how  the  2015  deal  is  framed,  my  vote  goes  for  advocating  a  “fairshares”  approach  that  sees  us  set  a  Global  Budget  in  line  with  science  to  keep  us  below  1.5  degrees  warming  that  is  then  portioned  out  according  to  a  balance  of  responsibility  (cumulative,  per  capita,  discounting  survival  emissions)  with  capacity  (using  the  right  indicators  to  ensure  real  equity,  including  a  high  income  threshold).  Countries  unable  to  stay  within  their  fair  share  would  have  to  pay,  and  climate  finance  to  support  developing  countries  stay  within  their  fair  share  would  also  been  a  key  component.  The  work  of  the  Stockholm  Environment  Institute  and  others  to  develop  such  an  approach  helps  us  have  something  both  idealistic  and  possible  –  the  technical  proposal  is  there,  we  have  to  make  it  accessible,  popular,  and  well  messaged.  Overall  I’m  fairly  restrained  in  my  optimism  about  the  possibility  of  a  global  popular  social  movement  for  climate  justice.  The  forces  of  evil  are  strong  and  the  forces  of  good  fragmented.  But  this  is  not  a  struggle  with  a  guaranteed  outcome  either  way.  And  while  it  continues,  we  can  always  find  ways  to  make  success  more  likely.  56  The  Evolution  of  Climate  Justice  Brian  Tokar  Climate  justice  has  emerged  over  more  than  a  decade  now  as  a  political  sensibility,  a  scientific  understanding,  and  an  organizing  agenda,  focused  on  the  disproportionate  impacts  of  the  climate  crisis  on  vulnerable  peoples  and  the  failure  of  conventional,  corporate-­‐driven  solutions.  The  multiple  meanings  of  climate  justice  roughly  correspond  to  the  differing  geographic  locations  of  its  key  proponents:  An  initial  impetus  came  from  indigenous  and  other  land-­‐based  peoples,  mainly  in  the  global  South,  who  have  raised  crucial  demands  at  the  UN  and  other  settings  since  the  early  2000s  around  their  communities’  unique  vulnerability  to  climate  disruptions.  Advocates  for  racial  and  environmental  justice  in  the  US  have  added  additional  dimensions,  including  a  link  to  the  legacies  of  the  civil  rights  movement,  an  understanding  of  the  effects  of  climate  change  on  marginalized  urban  communities,  and  essential  links  to  other  justice-­‐based  movements  around  food,  healthcare,  transportation,  etc.  Explicitly  anticapitalist  formations,  mainly  in  the  US  and  Europe,  have  brought  an  added  critical  dimension,  focused  on  the  systemic  roots  of  the  crisis  and  the  many  corporate-­‐driven  false  solutions,  including  nuclear  power,  biomass  incineration  and  biofuels,  and  the  emergence  of  carbon  markets.  All  three  sectors  are  also  challenging  the  largest  US  expansion  of  fossil  fuel  infrastructure  since  the  economic  boom  years  of  the  1950s.  With  fossil  fuels  now  coming  from  increasingly  extreme  sources,  the  impacts  of  this  new  infrastructure  on  affected  communities  are  immediate  and  often  devastating.  For  some  years  now,  people  engaged  with  all  these  approaches  have  tried  to  figure  out  how  to  work  together.  The  international  Climate  Justice  Now  network  has  become  divided  around  the  question  of  how  much  to  engage  in  the  official  UN  climate  negotiations.  A  fledgling  Mobilization  for  Climate  Justice  in  the  US  in  2009-­‐’10  fell  short  in  engaging  the  leadership  of  community-­‐based  environmental  justice  activists.  The  current  Climate  Justice  Alliance  is  significantly  led  by  people  of  color  groups,  but  seems  reluctant  to  engage  activists  outside  of  its  core  networks  and  best-­‐organized  locales.  Rising  Tide  is  organizing  direct  actions  against  extreme  energy  all  over  the  continent  but  is  limited  in  its  ability  to  speak  for  the  movement  as  a  whole.  So  how  to  move  forward  from  here?  The  global  justice  movement,  which  dramatically  challenged  the  major  international  financial  institutions  during  the  late  1990s-­‐early  2000s  sought  to  revive  the  long-­‐  standing  left  libertarian  vision  of  a  broad-­‐ranging  “movement  of  movements,”  organized  from  below  and  bringing  together  a  diversity  of  voices  into  an  organic  whole,  representing  far  more  than  the  sum  of  its  disparate  parts.  But  that  movement’s  appeal  was  limited  by  its  youth  and  by  “summit-­‐hopping”  strategies  that  embraced  community-­‐based  movements  more  in  rhetoric  than  in  praxis.  The  Occupy  movement  did  a  better  job  for  a  time,  but  a  mix  of  state  repression  and  internal  problems  limited  its  potential.  How  can  the  climate  justice  movement  succeed  where  these  earlier  efforts  fell  short?  The  still-­‐emerging  climate  justice  movement  has  many  unique  qualities  that  suggest  it  can  57  make  a  much  broader  contribution.  It  links  a  uniquely  urgent  environmental  focus  to  a  sharp  critique  of  the  economic  and  political  system.  It  brings  demands  for  racial  justice  and  human  rights  explicitly  into  environmental  organizing,  an  element  increasingly  embraced  by  climate  organizers  from  many  backgrounds  and  various  organizations.  It  offers  a  direct  and  compelling  challenge  to  an  especially  destructive  new  wave  of  resource  extraction,  and  looks  to  indigenous  values,  among  other  inspirations,  as  a  source  of  post-­‐  capitalist  solutions.  One  additional  set  of  actors  has  not  yet  become  fully  engaged  in  climate  justice,  but  needs  to  be  part  of  our  story:  that  is  the  various  efforts  toward  local  solutions  to  the  climate  crisis.  That  includes  people  who  are  localizing  their  food  systems,  greening  their  cities  and  towns,  and  sometimes  creating  community-­‐  owned  energy  alternatives.  Today  these  efforts  often  lack  the  essential  critical  dimension  that’s  inherent  to  climate  justice,  making  various  experiments  more  prone  to  cooptation  and  absorption  into  the  capitalist  market.  But  that  is  beginning  to  change,  from  explicitly  justice-­‐centered  urban  farming  projects  to  some  nonprofit  green  jobs  programs  focused  on  weatherizing  homes.  These  efforts  can  help  us  link  our  resistance  to  a  community-­‐centered  future  vision,  and  to  the  potential  for  a  democratic  confederation-­‐  from-­‐below  of  communities  that  might  help  us  transcend  the  limits  of  localism.  These  experiments  can  also  keep  us  focused  on  the  essential  promise  that  another  world  is  still  possible,  and  that  we  can  live  a  better  quality  of  life  with  less  energy  consumption  and  more  resilient  communities.  We  don’t  yet  have  a  clear  picture  of  the  new  organizing  models  that  can  genuinely  bring  together  all  these  disparate  elements.  The  September  2014  System  Change  Convergence  and  People’s  Climate  March  in  New  York  City,  followed  by  several  days  of  actions  and  educational  events  with  a  specific  climate  justice  focus,  helped  strengthen  the  movement’s  sense  of  political  and  organizational  vision,  and  demonstrated  the  broad  appeal  of  a  justice-­‐  and  liberation-­‐  centered  approach  to  climate  activism.  But  the  next  steps  remain  uncertain,  with  the  right  wing  dominance  of  mainstream  US  and  European  politics  systematically  obstructing  any  policy  measures  that  might  accurately  reflect  the  urgency  of  the  situation.  We  know  the  coming  decades’  climate  changes  will  be  disruptive  and  difficult,  but  our  actions  may  still  help  prevent  them  from  becoming  catastrophic  and  extreme.  This  will  only  come  to  pass,  however,  if  we  keep  our  eyes  on  the  prize  and  create  new  ways  to  work  together.  58  Stop  Accepting  Climate  Change,  Get  Active:  Global  Activism  and  Global  Negotiations  Emily  Williams  We’ve  probably  all  heard  of  the  Five  Stages  of  Climate  Grief.74  It  has  its  roots  in  the  Five  Stages  of  Grief,  and  refers  to  the  emotional  processing  our  society  uses  to  cope  with  climate  change.  First  you  are  in  denial.  You  deny  that  the  earth  is  warming,  you  deny  the  severity  of  climate  change,  and  you  deny  that  current  human  activities  could  cause  it.  Next,  you  become  angry  that  corporations  and  government  have  allowed  for  and  financed  such  reckless  exploitation,  creating  climate  chaos;  or  you  are  angry  that  environmentalists  are  demanding  that  people  change  their  habits  and  give  up  their  comforts  for  the  polar  bears.  Next,  you  bargain.  We  trade  scientific  fact  for  political  gain,  trade  carbon  credits  for  a  few  more  years  of  uncontrolled  burning,  and  trade  our  logical  minds  for  a  monopolized  media  that  will  tell  us  that  the  science  isn’t  that  serious  and  we  will  all  be  ok.  When  one  of  our  cities  is  devastated  by  a  superstorm  or  plagued  by  drought,  we  enter  into  depression.  And  so,  grudgingly,  we  enter  into  acceptance.  Acceptance  is  when  we  acknowledge  the  science  and  explore  solutions….  But  will  we  really  ever  accept?  Acceptance  assumes  that  if  we  understand  climate  science  and  are  given  enough  time  to  move  through  the  five  stages,  our  institutions  74    will  ultimately  collaborate  to  implement  solutions  that  will  mitigate,  and  help  adapt  to,  this  crisis.  However,  if  acceptance  is  enough  to  enact  change,  a  climate  denier  would  not  be  poised  to  be  head  of  the  Senate  Environment  and  Public  Works  committee,  our  government  would  not  continue  subsidizing  the  fossil  fuel  industry,  and  the  fossil  fuel  industry  itself  would  invest  its  money  and  infrastructure  in  renewable  technology  development,  accepting  that  we  must  leave  80%  of  reserves  in  the  ground.75  In  the  five  stages,  there  is  no  mention  activism.  However,  the  climate  crisis  needs  more  than  acceptance.  If  we  are  to  see  meaningful  action  on  climate  change,  we  cannot  wait  for  these  stages  to  play  out;  civil  society  needs  to  pave  the  way76.  Where  are  we  trying  to  get  to?  Let’s  talk  about  2  degrees  Celsius.  The  Copenhagen  Accord  set  the  target,  stating  that  governments  recognize  “that  the  increase  in  global  temperature  should  be  below  2  degrees  Celsius.”  But  what  does  2  degrees  entail?  Was  it  in  fact  science  that  arrived  at  the  2  degree  target  as  a  safe  limit?  Ultimately,  2  degrees  is  a  political  concept;  most  climate  research  shows  little  confidence  in  2  degrees  as  a  safe  limit.77  The  Alliance  of  Small  Island  States  (AOSIS)  –  a  contingent  of  more  than  forty  nations  at  the  COP  –  has  listed  1.5  degrees  of  warming  as  a  safer  limit  that  will  help  avoid  the  worst  catastrophes.78  Yet  it  is  hard  to  put  an  upper  limit  on  how  much  warming  is  “ok”;  no  matter  how  small,  75    76    six-­‐stages-­‐of-­‐climate-­‐grief/  77    two-­‐degrees-­‐global-­‐warming-­‐climate-­‐science/  78    threshold/  59  any  changes  in  the  climate  will  have  repercussions.  Already,  at  0.8  degrees  of  warming,  we  are  seeing  changes  in  our  climate  and  adverse  impacts  on  our  society  occurring  at  an  alarming  rate.  A  2  degree  limit  leaves  island  states  underwater,  or  at  least  inhabitable.  Representatives  from  African  nations  and  Pacific  Island  nations  stated  that  by  signing  onto  the  accord,  they  would  be  signing  a  “suicide  pact.”79  By  agreeing  to  this  political  limit,  our  governments  have  already  sold  out  the  Global  South,  committing  one  of  the  worst  and  largest-­‐scale  injustices.  However,  to  illustrate  just  how  hard  it  will  be  to  stay  within  even  2  degrees,  we  need  to  understand  the  carbon  gap.  The  carbon  gap  is  the  difference  between  the  rates  of  emissions  we  need  to  stay  under  to  achieve  climate  stability  versus  our  actual  rate  of  emissions.  Closing  this  gap  would  mean  achieving  a  modicum  of  climate  stability.  However,  our  current  rate  of  emissions  is  not  slowing,  and  the  gap  widens80.  Kevin  Anderson,  Deputy  Director  of  the  Tyndall  Centre,  outlined  the  global  emissions  cuts  we  need  to  make  if  we  are  to  stay  below  2  degrees.81  Anderson’s  plan  not  only  closes  the  gap,  but  factors  in  climate  justice.  Granting  non-­‐Annex  1  countries  (or  developing  countries)  a  carbon  budget  so  that  they  may  continue  to  develop  and  phase  away  from  fossil  fuels,  Anderson  details  that  the  wealthy  nations  of  Annex  1  need  to  cut  70%  of  their  emissions  in  10  years.  To  put  that  figure  in  perspective,  by  2023  the  U.S.  would  have  to  cut  the  equivalent  of  all  the  emission  from  the  electricity,  transportation,  79    crossroads/2014/sep/09/new-­‐york-­‐climate-­‐summit-­‐two-­‐  degrees-­‐warming-­‐policy-­‐disaster  80    81http://  esentations/What-­‐Next.pdf  and  agriculture  sectors.82  In  November  2014,  the  United  States  and  China  reached  a  “historic  agreement”,  committing  the  nations  to  certain  emissions  cuts  and  peaks  in  emissions  –  the  United  States  would  decrease  its  emissions  by  26-­‐28%  of  2005  levels  by  2025;  China  would  peak  its  emissions  in  2030  with  20%  of  its  electricity  pledged  to  come  from  non-­‐fossil  fuel  sources.83  This  agreement  is  historic  in  that  it  was  not  mandatory,  and  it  was  made  by  two  of  the  most  powerful  countries  in  the  climate  negotiations.  However,  this  agreement  is  non-­‐binding,  and  translates  to  a  10%  emissions  cut  from  the  base  year  scientists  use.  So  can  we  succeed  in  reducing  our  emissions  to  stay  below  2  degrees?  It’s  not  impossible,  but  ambitious  and  extremely  difficult,  especially  if  there  isn’t  financial  support  and  regulatory  pressure  to  enable  the  transition.  Climate  activism  as  a  tool  to  reach  our  goal  If  we  are  to  ensure  that  our  five  stages  of  climate  grief  result  in  ambitious  action  instead  of  a  numb  acceptance  of  the  horrors  that  are  to  occur,  we  have  to  rethink  how  we  as  civil  society  engage  to  catalyze  ambitious  action.  Civil  society  is  responsible  for  the  agreement  that  the  US  and  China  reached  last  week;  civil  society  pushed,  and  in  the  wake  of  the  Republican  Party’s  sweep  of  the  2014  midterm  elections,  U.S.  President  Barack  Obama  chose  to  take  a  stand  and  leave  his  legacy  as  an  actor  on  climate.  We  now  know  that  the  administration  listens  to  us;  this  past  week,  Obama  addressed  the  Young  Southeast  Asian  Leaders  Initiative  and  said  “the  issue  of  82    tml  83    divestment_b_6147234.html  60  climate  change  is  a  perfect  example  of  why  young  people  have  to  lead.”84  But  if  we  are  to  see  a  more  ambitious  agreement  and  achieve  significant  action  on  climate  change  that  adheres  to  the  severity  of  the  crisis,  and  if  we  are  to  achieve  climate  justice,  we  need  to  push  harder.  Nations  will  not  make  progress  if  their  civil  societies  do  not  push  them.  No  matter  how  much  we  hope,  our  governments’  negotiators  will  never  author  a  treaty  of  which  we  would  be  proud  unless  there  is  sufficient  pressure  coming  from  their  own  people  to  push  them  in  the  right  direction.  Despite  being  seemingly  easy  targets,  negotiators  at  the  COP  have  relatively  little  freedom  to  make  the  decisions  they  want  to  see.  At  COP  19  in  Warsaw,  Trigg  Talley  –  the  U.S.  Senior  State  Department  Negotiator  –  told  me  flat  out  that  he  wished  he  could  do  more  to  effect  change  at  the  COP,  but  unfortunately  his  hands  were  tied  and  he  lost  faith  in  the  process  a  long  time  ago.  Now  whether  Mr.  Talley  was  being  honest  or  if  he  was  just  trying  to  escape  my  badgering,  we  do  not  know.  What  we  do  know  though  is  that  these  negotiators,  despite  being  visible  and  easily  accessible  by  civil  society  at  the  COP,  will  not  make  the  changes  we  want  to  see  unless  they  are  told  to  do  so  by  their  superiors.  That  means  that  we  need  to  mobilize.  Especially  now  that  there  is  only  one  year  between  Lima  and  COP  21  in  Paris,  we  need  to  mobilize  even  more,  grow  stronger,  and  build  a  people’s  movement  that  can  effectively  push  our  governments  to  enter  into  that  conference  with  the  kind  of  ambition  that  would  make  us  proud.  So  let’s  84    youth-­‐on-­‐climate-­‐change-­‐old-­‐people-­‐theyve-­‐created-­‐a-­‐  mess/  take  a  look  at  how  one  campaign  –  divestment  –  manages  to  do  that.  Fossil  Fuel  Divestment  and  the  Road  to  2015  We’ve  heard  a  lot  about  divestment  over  the  past  few  years:  Bill  McKibben  became  an  unlikely  rock  star  overnight  with  the  Do  The  Math  tour,  the  campaign  spread  to  new  continents  making  it  an  international  effort,  and  the  Rockefellers  –  the  family  that  made  its  fortune  from  oil  –  chose  to  divest.  Divestment  gives  a  face  to  the  crisis,  allowing  people  to  rally  around  a  target  and  feel  empowered  to  take  their  futures  into  their  own  hands,  therefore  democratizing  the  issue  of  climate  change.  Divestment  has  the  power  to  change  the  public  perception  of  the  fossil  fuel  industry.  It  points  to  the  culprit  and  organizes  the  masses  to  demand  that  their  institutions  –  their  campuses,  businesses,  churches,  or  cities  –  refuse  to  profit  from  that  industry.  When  enough  institutions  divest,  it  creates  a  tipping  point  where  people  become  passionate  about  the  issue  and  put  enough  pressure  on  their  elected  officials  to  start  representing  their  needs  instead  of  the  desires  of  oil  barons.  Divestment  also  frees  up  finance,  forcing  institutions  and  our  government  to  shift  finances  away  from  the  industry  that’s  launching  us  over  the  edge  and  instead  begin  to  finance  and  build  the  low-­‐carbon,  just  economy  we  need.  This  is  the  reinvestment  side  of  the  campaign,  and  it  goes  far  beyond  moving  that  money  into  renewable  technology  development.  When  we  divest,  we  can  reinvest  in  communities  –  in  their  resilience  and  in  community-­‐owned  energy  generation  –  and  in  radical  and  innovative  solutions.  The  campaign  is  works  with  both  yin  and  yang:  it  identifies  that  which  is  harmful,  denounces  it,  and  calls  upon  society  61  to  denounce  it  as  well;  but  it  also  identifies  the  real  solutions,  and  financially  and  ideologically  supports  those  solutions  by  investing  in  them.  There  are  a  fair  number  of  critiques  of  divestment  –  that  it’s  too  symbolic  and  draws  attention  from  what  really  works  (on-­‐the-­‐  ground  resistance);  that  it  is  an  elitist  campaign  and  excludes  those  who  are  the  most  marginalized  by  the  climate  movement  and  those  who  are  most  affected  by  the  industry,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad;  and  that  isn’t  radical  if  folks  like  Tom  Steyer  can  hop  on  board  to  perpetuate  the  same  old  capitalist,  exploitative,  immoral  system.85  A  lot  of  those  critiques  have  validity,  and  like  most  campaigns,  the  divestment  campaign  has  made  many  mistakes  and  still  has  a  lot  to  learn  before  reaching  its  effective  potential.  But  it  learns  from  its  mistakes,  and  therefore  creates  a  platform  on  which  many  related  campaigns  can  converge  into  a  global  movement.  So  what  is  the  role  of  divestment  in  national  and  international  politics?  Divestment  is  local  –  it’s  implemented  at  the  local  level,  and  has  direct  local  repercussions.  Yet  its  ability  to  influence  the  public  opinion  on  climate  change  gives  it  a  global  scope.  It  is  a  solidarity  campaign  that  allows  institutions  to  take  a  stand  and  commit  to  the  transition  to  a  low-­‐  carbon  and  just  future,  standing  on  the  side  of  future  generations  and  those  most  disproportionately  impacted  by  both  climate  change  and  the  extractive  economy.  It  commits  to  invest  in  the  solutions  that  the  Global  South  so  desperately  need.  This  shift  impacts  negotiations.  When  enough  institutions  in  a  country  divest,  it  begins  to  change  the  climate  and  discourse  around  85    divestment-­‐how-­‐evolve-­‐campaign-­‐beyond-­‐its-­‐shortcomings  climate  change  and  the  fossil  fuel  economy.  It  ultimately  shifts  the  political  atmosphere  of  the  country  and  puts  pressure  on  governments  to  go  into  the  negotiations  with  a  few  more  bargaining  chips.  When  our  campuses,  states,  foundations,  and  other  institutions  divest  in  the  United  States,  it  will  give  Obama  the  go-­‐ahead  and  the  political  backing  to  offer  more  at  the  UN.  It’s  up  to  us  Divestment,  and  every  other  campaign  that  focuses  on  local  and  grassroots  action,  shifts  systems  and  create  tipping  points.  Civil  rights,  women’s  rights,  and  democracy  were  all  won  by  local,  grassroots  actions  and  narratives.  They  have  the  power  to  create  a  peoples’  movement  that  creates  the  political  backing  (or  pressure)  that  allows  for  (or  forces)  governments  to  enact  changes  that  work  for  the  people  over  profit.  But  no  one  else  is  going  to  create  this  change.  If  we  want  to  see  change,  it’s  up  to  us.  It  is  unlikely  that  any  agreement  reached  in  Paris  will  manage  to  “lead  the  world  away  from  its  current  destination  of  global  climate  apartheid  and  toward  climate  justice.”  To  accomplish  that,  we  would  need  to  build  the  largest  movement  ever  in  the  history  of  humanity,  and  most  likely  experience  many  devastating  natural  disasters  that  have  a  severe  negative  impact  on  the  global  economy.  That  movement  would  have  to  be  built  in  six  months  to  give  time  to  the  heads  of  state  to  design  a  treaty  that  would  sufficiently  respond  to  the  threats  of  climate  change,  mitigate  emissions  as  ambitiously  as  possible,  and  finance  extreme  adaptation  to  reduce  the  level  of  damage  that  will  be  experienced  by  the  Global  South.  It  is  unlikely  to  happen.  What  can  happen,  however,  is  that  between  now  and  Paris,  we  can  begin  to  62  build  that  movement  and  be  ready  to  launch  the  biggest,  most  diverse,  and  most  radical  movement  the  world  has  ever  seen  in  Paris  when  the  final  decision  is  made.  We  can  launch  that  movement  on  the  last  day  of  COP  21.  We  will  still  fail  the  Global  South  and  condemn  many,  many  lives,  but  we  can  still  save  some.  Many  in  our  society  have  moved  through  all  five  stages  of  grief,  and  hang  in  an  uneasy  balance  of  acceptance  and  denial  as  they  anxiously  place  hope  in  the  status  quo’s  ability  to  make  the  changes  necessary.  But  it’s  time  to  stop  accepting  and  start  acting.  If  we  want  to  see  global  change,  we  need  a  global  movement  –  and  that  movement  needs  to  come  from  the  grassroots,  be  led  by  those  most  disproportionately  impacted,  and  create  the  solutions  that  our  generation  needs.  Let’s  get  active,  very  active,  now.  63  Vision,  Hope,  and  Power:  A  Contribution  to  the  Discussion  Leehi  Yona  What  a  loaded  question.  When  I  was  first  asked  to  answer  it,  I  struggled.  I  see  and  interact  with  climate  change  from  many  points  of  view  –  as  a  community  organizer,  as  a  budding  climate  scientist,  as  a  policymaker-­‐  in-­‐training,  as  an  amateur  sociologist,  as  an  American  student,  as  an  Israeli,  as  a  Canadian,  as  a  representative  of  future  generations.  How  could  I  possibly  condense  these  viewpoints  into  two  pages?  If  I  could  pull  some  key  thoughts,  I’d  break  it  down  into  these  nine  words:  vision,  outrage,  hope,  humanity,  storytelling,  celebration,  interaction,  mobilization,  and  power.  These  thoughts  by  no  means  encapsulate  all  I  have  to  say  about  this  question,  but  it  brings  to  light  some  short,  important  personal  realizations  I’ve  had  in  my  climate  justice  work.  Vision  What  is  a  vision?  A  vision  is  the  broader  imagination,  the  future  we  can  see  within  our  grasp.  A  vision  is  boldly  optimistic,  ambitious,  dream-­‐like.  Of  course,  our  vision  is  vitally  important  in  determining  our  decisions.  Above  all,  we  need  to  be  driven  by  a  vision,  not  a  goal.  This  understanding  is  crucial.  Our  motivations  for  our  work  –  the  things  that  govern  what  we  do  –  should  be  huge,  and  hopeful,  and  even  unrealistic  at  first.  That  is  fine,  because  they  are  visions  –  they  shouldn’t  be  solutions  that  would  work  within  the  systems  we  currently  have,  but  solutions  that  transcend  beyond  these  very  systems.  They  should  be  wildly  idealistic,  because  even  the  most  idealistic  of  visions  have  been  achieved  in  history  with  a  little  faith.  Outrage  Where  is  the  outrage?  Seriously,  where  is  it?  We  need  more  outrage!  We  need  to  convey  the  urgency  of  this  problem,  the  way  we  feel  it  sink  a  heavy  weight  onto  our  hearts.  We  need  to  make  others  –  particularly  those  in  power  –  feel  the  suffering,  feel  the  heartbreak,  feel  the  injustice,  feel  the  outrage  that  global  warming  stirs.  The  time  has  passed  to  temper  our  anger;  we  cannot  and  should  not  subdue  our  burning  fire  that  energizes  us  to  find  the  solutions  to  this  climate  challenge.  Hope  This  outrage  cannot  survive  without  hope.  We  cannot  exist  without  hope.  And  we  need  even  more  than  just  hope  to  solve  a  problem  as  monstrous  as  the  one  we  are  facing  –  we  need  extravagant  hope,  the  unwavering  and  fervent  belief  that  we  will  rise  to  the  occasion  and  find  a  solution  to  the  climate  crisis.  Yes,  we  can  be  critical  (we  must),  yes,  we  must  have  outrage  –  but  we  must  never  lose  sight  of  our  vision,  lose  sight  of  hope.  To  do  so,  to  allow  our  cynicism  and  pessimism  to  consume  us,  would  be  condemning  ourselves  to  failure  by  default.  We  must  couple  our  urgency  with  active  hope.  Humanity  We  must  remember  that  climate  change  has  a  human  face.  Global  warming  is  not  about  rising  sea  levels  and  extreme  weather  events  –  it’s  about  Ula  who  lives  in  the  Maldives  and  doesn’t  know  where  her  children  will  live,  Olivia  who  lives  in  a  First  Nations  community  and  doesn’t  know  what’s  in  her  drinking  water  –  it’s  about  these  people  on  the  front  lines.  64  Acknowledging  our  shared  humanity  when  speaking  about  climate  change  is  also  about  acknowledging  that  some  communities  are  disproportionally  affected  by  climate  change  compared  to  others.  This  particularly  includes  communities  of  lower  socioeconomic  status,  people  of  colour,  and  women.  We  need  to  make  sure  that  these  voices  are  amplified  within  our  movement,  so  that  the  most  common  face  speaking  about  climate  change  isn’t  that  of  affluent  white  men.  Let’s  bring  more  humanity  into  our  movement  by  striving  to  have  a  real  anti-­‐oppression  model  of  leadership.  Storytelling  and  Power  This  humanity  is  why  we  need  storytelling.  Numbers  and  data  don’t  really  work  when  it  comes  to  motivating  people  to  act  on  climate  change  –  but  the  stories  of  those  suffering  climate  injustices  do.  An  important  element  to  acknowledge  when  it  comes  to  climate  change  is  the  third  dimension  of  power.  This  dimension  of  power  is  one  that  isn’t  directly  exerted  upon  a  person,  one  wherein  consciousness  is  manipulated.  The  third  dimension  of  power  here  is  one  that  is  exerted  upon  us  by  broken  systems  of  governance  and  fossil  fuel  companies  that  make  us  believe  that  sweeping  change  isn’t  possible  or  feasible  when  it  comes  to  climate  action.  But  this  isn’t  true.  We  do  have  the  power  to  change  things  –  we  must  re-­‐write  the  narrative  we’re  being  given,  the  narrative  that  is  being  told.  Storytelling  is  vital.  Chee  Yoke  Ling  of  Third  World  Network  once  told  me  that  youth  have  the  power  to  bring  the  future  into  the  present.  We  must  do  this  through  storytelling.  We  need  this  framing  to  bypass  the  human  exemptionalism  that  is  wreaking  havoc  on  climate  progress.  Celebration  I  cannot  stress  this  enough.  Celebrate!  Celebrate  every  little  accomplishment  worth  celebrating.  Celebrate  your  colleagues,  celebrate  your  volunteers,  and  most  importantly,  celebrate  yourselves  and  the  collective  work  you  are  all  doing.  We  rarely  celebrate  in  this  movement  –  we  move  forward  too  quickly.  As  soon  as  we’ve  finished  a  march,  as  we’ve  done  whatever  needs  to  be  done  –  we  move  on  to  the  next  task  at  hand.  We  rarely  celebrate  the  beautiful  thing  we’ve  just  done.  Of  course,  this  behaviour  makes  sense,  considering  the  urgency  of  climate  change  –  but  it  is  unsustainable!  Celebrate!  Interaction  When  we’re  working  on  effecting  positive  change,  it’s  important  to  nurture  our  relationships  with  each  other,  and  with  nature.  Many  of  us  may  lose  sight  of  this.  Think  about  it:  for  those  of  you  working  on  organizing  this  march,  what  did  you  spend  most  of  your  time  doing?  You  were  most  likely,  just  as  I  was,  glued  to  your  computer,  to  social  media,  to  various  screens  that  disconnect  us  both  from  each  other  and  from  the  very  planet  we’re  trying  to  save.  That  needs  to  change.  We  need  more  direct,  face-­‐  to-­‐face  interactions  and  conversations  with  the  people  who  matter  –  with  everyone.  Mobilization  There  are  frequently  such  marches  and  rallies  that  take  place…  yet  usually,  the  end  outcome  is  that  people  go  home  and  after  a  65  few  days  ask  themselves,  “Well,  now  what?”  Now,  we  must  mobilize!  Too  often  such  gatherings  are  plagued  by  a  lack  of  concrete  demands  or  next  steps.  Let’s  make  sure  our  demands  and  asks  are  clear.  Power  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  power  dynamics  are  entirely  at  play  when  it  comes  to  global  warming  inaction.  We  must  recognize  these  sources  of  disempowerment  and  target  them  directly  to  shift  it  back  to  the  people.  Like  I  said,  these  words  do  not  encompass  all  I  have  to  say  –  but  I  do  believe  that  they  can  bring  us  closer  to  building  the  movement  we  need  for  real  climate  justice.  66  APPENDIX:  Climate  Justice  Manifestos  Editors’  note:  we  have  assembled  this  by  no  means  comprehensive  list  of  climate  justice  manifestos  so  that  the  movement  can  see  some  of  its  own  demands  evolve  over  time.  Many  of  these  manifestos  have  been  drawn  from  the  website  of  the  Centre  for  Civil  Society,  University  of  KwaZulu-­‐Natal:    ,  which  we  gratefully  acknowledge.  At  the  CCS  website,  Patrick  Bond  “defines”  climate  justice  as  “the  fusion  of  social  and  environmental  justice  philosophies,  political  practices  and  projects  aiming  to  both  redefine  and  redistribute  wealth  and  to  transform  socio-­‐economic  relations,  grounded  in  a  political-­‐ecological  praxis  (analysis-­‐activism)  that  seeks  root  causes  and  proposes  and  implements  genuine  solutions  to  the  climate  crisis.”86  86  See  also    statements/  67  Durban  Group  for  Climate  Justice,  Durban,  October  2004  “The  Durban  Declaration  on  Carbon  Trading”  As  representatives  of  people’s  movements  and  independent  organisations,  we  reject  the  claim  that  carbon  trading  will  halt  the  climate  crisis.  This  crisis  has  been  caused  more  than  anything  else  by  the  mining  of  fossil  fuels  and  the  release  of  their  carbon  to  the  oceans,  air,  soil  and  living  things.  This  excessive  burning  of  fossil  fuels  is  now  jeopardising  Earth’s  ability  to  maintain  a  liveable  climate.  Governments,  export  credit  agencies,  corporations  and  international  financial  institutions  continue  to  support  and  finance  fossil  fuel  exploration,  extraction  and  other  activities  that  worsen  global  warming,  such  as  forest  degradation  and  destruction  on  a  massive  scale,  while  dedicating  only  token  sums  to  renewable  energy.  It  is  particularly  disturbing  that  the  World  Bank  has  recently  defied  the  recommendation  of  its  own  Extractive  Industries  Review  which  calls  for  the  phasing  out  of  World  Bank  financing  for  coal,  oil  and  gas  extraction.  We  denounce  the  further  delays  in  ending  fossil  fuel  extraction  that  are  being  caused  by  corporate,  government  and  United  Nations’  attempts  to  construct  a  ‘carbon  market’,  including  a  market  trading  in  ‘carbon  sinks.’  History  has  seen  attempts  to  commodify  land,  food,  labour,  forests,  water,  genes  and  ideas.  Carbon  trading  follows  in  the  footsteps  of  this  history  and  turns  the  earth’s  carbon-­‐cycling  capacity  into  property  to  be  bought  or  sold  in  a  global  market.  Through  this  process  of  creating  a  new  commodity  –  carbon  –  the  Earth’s  ability  and  capacity  to  support  a  climate  conducive  to  life  and  human  societies  is  now  passing  into  the  same  corporate  hands  that  are  destroying  the  climate.  People  around  the  world  need  to  be  made  aware  of  this  commodification  and  privatisation  and  actively  intervene  to  ensure  the  protection  of  the  Earth’s  climate.  Carbon  trading  will  not  contribute  to  achieving  this  protection  of  the  Earth’s  climate.  It  is  a  false  solution  which  entrenches  and  magnifies  social  inequalities  in  many  ways:  –  The  carbon  market  creates  transferable  rights  to  dump  carbon  in  the  air,  oceans,  soil  and  vegetation  far  in  excess  of  the  capacity  of  these  systems  to  hold  it.  Billions  of  dollars  worth  of  these  rights  are  to  be  awarded  free  of  charge  to  the  biggest  corporate  emitters  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  electric  power,  iron  and  steel,  cement,  pulp  and  paper,  and  other  sectors  in  industrialised  nations  who  have  caused  the  climate  crisis  and  already  exploit  these  systems  the  most.  Costs  of  future  reductions  in  fossil  fuel  use  are  likely  to  fall  disproportionately  on  the  public  sector,  communities,  indigenous  peoples  and  individual  taxpayers.  –  The  Kyoto  Protocol’s  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM),  as  well  as  many  private  sector  trading  schemes,  encourage  industrialised  countries  and  their  corporations  to  finance  or  create  cheap  carbon  dumps  such  as  large-­‐scale  tree  plantations  in  the  South  as  a  lucrative  alternative  to  reducing  emissions  in  the  North.  Other  CDM  projects,  such  as  68  hydrochlorofluorocarbons  (HCFC)  -­‐reduction  schemes,  focus  on  end-­‐of  pipe  technologies  and  thus  do  nothing  to  reduce  the  impact  of  –  Fossil  fuel  industries’  impacts  on  local  communities.  In  addition,  these  projects  dwarf  the  tiny  volume  of  renewable  energy  projects  which  constitute  the  CDM’s  sustainable  development  window-­‐dressing.  –  Impacts  from  fossil-­‐fuel  industries  and  other  greenhouse-­‐gas  producing  industries  such  as  displacement,  pollution,  or  climate  change,  are  already  disproportionately  felt  by  small  island  states,  coastal  peoples,  indigenous  peoples,  local  communities,  fisherfolk,  women,  youth,  poor  people,  elderly  and  marginalised  communities.  CDM  projects  intensify  these  impacts  in  several  ways.  First,  they  sanction  continued  exploration  for,  and  extraction,  refining  and  burning  of  fossil  fuels.  Second,  by  providing  finance  for  private  sector  projects  such  as  industrial  tree  plantations,  they  appropriate  land,  water  and  air  already  supporting  the  lives  and  livelihoods  of  local  communities  for  new  carbon  dumps  for  Northern  industries.  –  The  refusal  to  phase  out  the  use  of  coal,  oil  and  gas,  which  is  further  entrenched  by  carbon  trading,  is  also  causing  more  and  more  military  conflicts  around  the  world,  magnifying  social  and  environmental  injustice.  This  in  turn  diverts  vast  resources  to  military  budgets  which  could  otherwise  be  utilised  to  support  economies  based  on  renewable  energies  and  energy  efficiency.  –  In  addition  to  these  injustices,  the  internal  weaknesses  and  contradictions  of  carbon  trading  are  in  fact  likely  to  make  global  warming  worse  rather  than  ‘mitigate’  it.  CDM  projects,  for  instance,  cannot  be  verified  to  be  ‘neutralising’  any  given  quantity  of  fossil  fuel  extraction  and  burning.  Their  claim  to  be  able  to  do  so  is  increasingly  dangerous  because  it  creates  the  illusion  that  consumption  and  production  patterns,  particularly  in  the  North,  can  be  maintained  without  harming  the  climate.  –  In  addition,  because  of  the  verification  problem,  as  well  as  a  lack  of  credible  regulation,  no  one  in  the  CDM  market  is  likely  to  be  sure  what  they  are  buying.  Without  a  viable  commodity  to  trade,  the  CDM  market  and  similar  private  sector  trading  schemes  are  a  total  waste  of  time  when  the  world  has  a  critical  climate  crisis  to  address.  –  In  an  absurd  contradiction  the  World  Bank  facilitates  these  false,  market-­‐based  approaches  to  climate  change  through  its  Prototype  Carbon  Fund,  the  BioCarbon  Fund  and  the  Community  Development  Carbon  Fund  at  the  same  time  it  is  promoting,  on  a  far  greater  scale,  the  continued  exploration  for,  and  extraction  and  burning  of  fossil  fuels  –  many  of  which  are  to  ensure  increased  emissions  of  the  North.  In  conclusion,  ‘giving  carbon  a  price’  will  not  prove  to  be  any  more  effective,  democratic,  or  conducive  to  human  welfare,  than  giving  genes,  forests,  biodiversity  or  clean  rivers  a  price.  We  reaffirm  that  drastic  reductions  in  emissions  from  fossil  fuel  use  are  a  prerequisite  if  we  are  to  avert  the  climate  crisis.  We  affirm  our  responsibility  to  coming  generations  to  seek  real  solutions  that  are  viable  and  truly  sustainable  and  that  do  not  sacrifice  marginalised  communities.  We  therefore  commit  ourselves  to  help  build  a  global  grassroots  movement  for  climate  justice,  mobilise  communities  around  the  world  and  pledge  our  solidarity  with  people  opposing  carbon  trading  on  the  ground.  69  Climate  Justice  Now!  “Founding  Statement”  Bali,  December  14,  2007  Peoples  from  social  organizations  and  movements  from  across  the  globe  brought  the  fight  for  social,  ecological  and  gender  justice  into  the  negotiating  rooms  and  onto  the  streets  during  the  UN  climate  summit  in  Bali.  Inside  and  outside  the  convention  centre,  activists  demanded  alternative  policies  and  practices  that  protect  livelihoods  and  the  environment.  In  dozens  of  side  events,  reports,  impromptu  protests  and  press  conferences,  the  false  solutions  to  climate  change  –  such  as  carbon  offsetting,  carbon  trading  for  forests,  agrofuels,  trade  liberalization  and  privatization  pushed  by  governments,  financial  institutions  and  multinational  corporations  –  have  been  exposed.  Affected  communities,  Indigenous  Peoples,  women  and  peasant  farmers  called  for  real  solutions  to  the  climate  crisis,  solutions  which  have  failed  to  capture  the  attention  of  political  leaders.  These  genuine  solutions  include:  –  Reduced  consumption.  –  Huge  financial  transfers  from  North  to  South  based  on  historical  responsibility  and  ecological  debt  for  adaptation  and  mitigation  costs  paid  for  by  redirecting  military  budgets,  innovative  taxes  and  debt  cancellation.  –  Leaving  fossil  fuels  in  the  ground  and  investing  in  appropriate  energy-­‐efficiency  and  safe,  clean  and  community-­‐led  renewable  energy.  –  Rights  based  resource  conservation  that  enforces  Indigenous  land  rights  and  promotes  peoples’  sovereignty  over  energy,  forests,  land  and  water.  –  Sustainable  family  farming  and  peoples’  food  sovereignty.  Inside  the  negotiations,  the  rich  industrialized  countries  have  put  unjustifiable  pressure  on  Southern  governments  to  commit  to  emissions’  reductions.  At  the  same  time,  they  have  refused  to  live  up  to  their  own  legal  and  moral  obligations  to  radically  cut  emissions  and  support  developing  countries’  efforts  to  reduce  emissions  and  adapt  to  climate  impacts.  Once  again,  the  majority  world  is  being  forced  to  pay  for  the  excesses  of  the  minority.  Compared  to  the  outcomes  of  the  official  negotiations,  the  major  success  of  Bali  is  the  momentum  that  has  been  built  towards  creating  a  diverse,  global  movement  for  climate  justice.  We  will  take  our  struggle  forward  not  just  in  the  talks,  but  on  the  ground  and  in  the  streets  –  Climate  Justice  Now!  70  Climate  Justice  Alliance,  February  2010  “What  does  Climate  Justice  mean  in  Europe?”  This  discussion  paper  was  drafted  by  a  working  group  at  the  Climate  Justice  Alliance  meeting  in  Amsterdam  in  February  2010.  Its  purpose  is  to  collectively  explore  the  concept  of  climate  justice  in  the  context  of  Europe.  Through  providing  this  discussion  paper  as  both  incomplete  and  unending,  we  hope  it  will  be  useful  as  a  tool  in  linking  the  diverse  struggles  throughout  Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  strengthen  the  collective  movement  towards  our  visions  of  the  future.  In  choosing  Europe  as  the  terrain  of  this  discussion,  we  are  not  separating  ourselves  from  those  struggling  elsewhere  in  the  world.  On  the  contrary,  through  asking  what  the  basis  of  climate  justice  is  in  on  our  own  doorstep,  and  discovering  how  we  go  about  implementing  it,  we  are  fighting  for  a  better  world  for  all.  The  abject  failure  of  governments  to  provide  a  political  solution  to  the  climate  crisis  in  Copenhagen  was  unsurprising  to  those  who,  from  the  outset,  understood  the  UN  as  an  institution  whose  interests  lie  in  extending  the  legitimacy  of  global  capitalism  and  the  nation-­‐state.  Those  who  placed  their  hope  in  the  COP15,  due  either  to  naivety  or  necessity,  left  with  a  sense  of  disbelief.  More  and  more  are  now  coming  to  the  realisation  that  it  is  social  movements,  not  governments,  that  have  the  power  to  make  the  necessary  changes  to  solve  the  climate  crisis.  Linking  with  social  struggle.  The  solutions  to  systematic  repression,  exploitation,  and  the  climate  crisis  are  the  same.  Climate  Justice  means  linking  all  struggles  together  that  reject  neoliberal  markets  and  working  towards  a  world  that  puts  autonomous  decision  making  power  in  the  hands  of  the  communities.  We  look  towards  a  society  which  recognises  our  historical  responsibilities  and  seeks  to  protect  the  global  commons,  both  in  terms  of  the  climate  and  life  itself.  Solidarity.  From  the  shanty  towns  of  the  Americas  to  the  precariats  of  Europe,  the  global  south  is  all  of  those,  whether  resisting  or  not,  who  suffer  the  impacts  of  the  relationships  of  capital  and  domination.  It  is  important  to  recognise  that  the  marginalised  in  the  geographic  south  are  also  the  front  line  of  the  struggle  for  climate  justice.  Solidarity  is  the  realisation  of  the  common  struggle.  It  is  realising  that  the  geography  which  divides  us  is  insignificant  compared  to  the  strength  of  the  values  that  hold  us  together  –  our  shared  affirmation  of  life  and  liberty  in  the  face  of  exploitation  and  oppression.  Solidarity  means  fighting  for  our  own  autonomy  at  the  same  time  as  we  struggle  against  corporations  and  the  relationships  of  capital  that  exploit  people  everywhere.  The  EU.  Europe,  including  the  EU,  is  historically  responsible  for  climate  change  and  social  and  environmental  exploitation  world  wide.  The  EU  as  a  political  institution  serves  only  to  extend  the  interests  of  the  wealthy  and  the  powerful.  Its  Lisbon  Agenda,  and  the  more  recent  2020  Agenda,  looks  to  increase  the  dominance  of  European  based  corporations  and  extend  the  rule  of  capital  into  every  sphere  of  our  lives.  Its  pursuit  of  the  Emissions  Trading  Scheme  has  pioneered  a  system  that  serves  only  to  profit  from  our  ecological  crises,  its  Bologna  process  turns  71  our  universities  into  ‘sausage  factories’,  whilst  the  EU  trade  strategy  looks  to  control  access  to  natural  resources  and  cheap  labour  for  European  corporations,  continuing  its  historical  legacy  of  colonialism  through  different  methods.  Overcoming  institutions  that  override  the  autonomy  of  communities  through  tying  us  to  capitalist  growth  is  essential  if  we  are  to  move  towards  an  ecologically  and  socially  just  world.  Food  and  Agriculture.  Climate  Justice  is  closely  linked  to  breaking  the  circle  of  industrialised  agricultural  production  perpetuated  through  WTO  and  European  policies.  Speculation  on  food  as  an  industrial  commodity  and  the  domination  of  long  unsustainable  production  chains  by  international  capital  threatens  the  biosphere  and  the  lives  of  billions  of  people.  This  attack  on  food  sovereignty  and  the  planet  must  be  met  with  a  social  struggle  for  food  production  defined  by  the  needs  and  rights  of  local  communities.  This  means  redefining,  re-­‐  localising  and  re-­‐appropriating  the  control  of  our  food  and  agricultural  systems  through  engaging  and  acting  in  solidarity  with  existing  struggles.  Military.  In  Europe,  as  elsewhere,  the  military-­‐industrial  complex  is  one  of  the  key  actors  in  maintaining  business  as  usual  in  the  current  dominant  economic  political  system.  Under  the  false  promise  of  ensuring  ‘security’  and  in  the  ‘war  against  terror’,  huge  and  ever  increasing  budgets  are  being  spent  on  military  and  policing  infrastructure.  Often  military  ventures  are  thinly  veiled  attempts  at  securing  access  to  foreign  resources  and  ensuring  vast  profits  for  the  arms  industry.  The  real  security  threat  we  face  cannot  be  addressed  by  armed  force  and  social  control.  Social  exclusion,  poverty,  loss  of  biodiversity,  ecosystem  collapse,  and  increasingly  scarce  resources  leading  to  an  escalation  in  conflicts  and  resource  wars,  are  posing  a  far  bigger  threat  than  the  ghost  of  terror,  or  any  other  imaginary  foe  created  to  mask  the  social  conflicts  that  exists  within  and  between  our  societies.  The  struggle  for  climate  justice  is  about  highlighting  another  concept  of  sustainable  ‘human  security’,  which  a  military  and  policing  force  will  never  be  able  to  guarantee.  In  practice  by  resisting  changes  in  our  global  systems,  the  military  and  police  apparatus  is  endangering  security,  not  increasing  it.  Migration.  Climate  change  is  exacerbating  factors  which  force  people  to  migrate;  lack  of  access  to  land  or  livelihood,  failing  agriculture,  conflict  and  lack  of  access  to  water.  The  tiny  proportion  of  those  displaced  who  attempt  the  expensive  and  dangerous  journey,  are  met  with  militarised  border  controls  if  they  reach  ‘Fortress  Europe.’  Labelled  ‘illegals,’  they  are  denied  basic  human  rights  and  struggle  to  live  in  dignity,  whilst  providing  a  neat  scapegoat  for  a  range  of  social  problems.  The  historical  development  of  capital  accumulation,  colonialism  and  carbon  emissions,  means  that  Europe  has  a  unique  responsibility  to  act  in  solidarity  with  those  who  are  displaced.  In  our  free  market  system  only  those  with  certain  papers  such  as  an  EU  passport  and  capital  and  commodities  are  free  to  move  around  the  world.  Those  seeking  a  better  life  or  moving  to  survive  are  increasingly  denied  this  option.  As  well  as  fighting  for  the  conditions  for  people  to  be  able  to  stay  in  their  homes  and  communities,  we  must  also  defend  the  principle  of  freedom  of  movement  for  all  as  one  key  aspect  of  climate  justice.  Energy.  The  need  for  constant  economic  growth  also  means  an  ever  increasing  thirst  for  energy.  While  there  is  sufficient  energy  in  72  Europe  we  see  that  despite  producing  more  and  more  energy,  due  to  inefficiency  and  inequality,  millions  of  people  in  Europe  do  not  have  access  to  affordable  energy  and  are  unable  to  heat  their  homes.  Moreover  our  energy  policy  within  Europe  directly  results  in  huge  amounts  of  dangerous  waste  (nuclear  and  other),  and  vast  levels  of  emissions  which  are  rapidly  destabilising  the  global  climate.  We  must  ensure  that  everyone  in  Europe  has  access  to  sufficient  levels  of  energy  which  is  produced  in  a  way  that  does  not  damage  or  endanger  people  or  the  environment.  We  need  to  radically  transform  our  ways  of  producing,  distributing  and  consuming  energy.  This  means  leaving  fossil  fuels  in  the  ground,  democratising  means  of  production  and  changing  our  attitudes  to  energy  consumption.  Energy  resources  should  be  in  the  control  of  communities  that  use  them,  and  this  means  challenging  the  power  and  ownership  of  energy  companies.  Production  and  consumption.  Europe  has  some  of  the  highest  concentrations  of  wealth  in  the  world  and  consumes  enormous  amounts  of  resources,  yet  there  are  stark  inequalities.  Production  and  consumption  should  be  based  on  values  other  than  profit;  this  means  changing  the  way  we  structure  our  social,  economic  and  political  relationships,  and  ensuring  democratic  control  of  the  means  of  production.  This  will  require  expropriation  and  conversion  not  only  of  climate  damaging  companies  and  industries,  but  all  spheres  of  life  that  operate  according  to  the  logic  of  capital.  We  need  to  challenge  individualism  in  society  and  stop  allowing  ourselves  to  be  defined  as  consumers,  a  de-­‐humanising  and  restrictive  identity.  Social  values  must  be  based  on  human  needs  and  not  on  ever  increasing  consumption,  economic  growth  and  competition.  Climate  Justice  in  Europe.  Climate  justice  means  recognising  that  the  capitalist  growth  paradigm,  which  leads  to  over  extraction,  overproduction  and  overconsumption  stands  in  deep  contrast  to  the  biophysical  limits  of  the  planet  and  the  struggle  for  social  justice.  The  historical  legacy  of  European  expansion/colonialism  is  a  root  cause  of  the  current  geopolitical  inequalities,  in  which  the  global  North  is  consuming  the  global  South.  Climate  justice  means  addressing  the  inequalities  that  exist  between  and  within  countries,  and  replacing  the  economic  and  political  systems  that  uphold  them.  The  status  quo  is  maintained  through  unequal  exchange  via  unjust  trade  policies  and  unequal  access  to  technological  capacity.  On  a  global  level  Europe  is  a  centre  of  capital  accumulation  and  thus  socio-­‐ecological  exploitation  of  the  South,  however,  internally  in  Europe  there  are  huge  inequalities  in  terms  of  race,  gender  and  class.  These  are  crucial  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  in  the  struggle  for  climate  justice  on  a  European  level.  We  hope  that  this  discussion  paper  has  helped  to  explore  the  concept  of  climate  justice  in  the  context  of  Europe,  and  we  invite  your  comments  to  further  this  discussion.  Fundamentally,  we  believe  that  we  cannot  prevent  further  global  warming  without  addressing  the  way  our  societies  are  organised  –  the  fight  for  climate  justice  and  the  fight  for  social  justice  are  one  and  the  same.  73  World  People’s  Conference  on  Climate  Change  and  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth,  Cochabamba,  April  2010  “People’s  Agreement”  Today,  our  Mother  Earth  is  wounded  and  the  future  of  humanity  is  in  danger.  If  global  warming  increases  by  more  than  2  degrees  Celsius,  a  situation  that  the  “Copenhagen  Accord”  could  lead  to,  there  is  a  50%  probability  that  the  damages  caused  to  our  Mother  Earth  will  be  completely  irreversible.  Between  20%  and  30%  of  species  would  be  in  danger  of  disappearing.  Large  extensions  of  forest  would  be  affected,  droughts  and  floods  would  affect  different  regions  of  the  planet,  deserts  would  expand,  and  the  melting  of  the  polar  ice  caps  and  the  glaciers  in  the  Andes  and  Himalayas  would  worsen.  Many  island  states  would  disappear,  and  Africa  would  suffer  an  increase  in  temperature  of  more  than  3  degrees  Celsius.  Likewise,  the  production  of  food  would  diminish  in  the  world,  causing  catastrophic  impact  on  the  survival  of  inhabitants  from  vast  regions  in  the  planet,  and  the  number  of  people  in  the  world  suffering  from  hunger  would  increase  dramatically,  a  figure  that  already  exceeds  1.02  billion  people.  The  corporations  and  governments  of  the  so-­‐  called  “developed”  countries,  in  complicity  with  a  segment  of  the  scientific  community,  have  led  us  to  discuss  climate  change  as  a  problem  limited  to  the  rise  in  temperature  without  questioning  the  cause,  which  is  the  capitalist  system.  We  confront  the  terminal  crisis  of  a  civilizing  model  that  is  patriarchal  and  based  on  the  submission  and  destruction  of  human  beings  and  nature  that  accelerated  since  the  industrial  revolution.  The  capitalist  system  has  imposed  on  us  a  logic  of  competition,  progress  and  limitless  growth.  This  regime  of  production  and  consumption  seeks  profit  without  limits,  separating  human  beings  from  nature  and  imposing  a  logic  of  domination  upon  nature,  transforming  everything  into  commodities:  water,  earth,  the  human  genome,  ancestral  cultures,  biodiversity,  justice,  ethics,  the  rights  of  peoples,  and  life  itself.  Under  capitalism,  Mother  Earth  is  converted  into  a  source  of  raw  materials,  and  human  beings  into  consumers  and  a  means  of  production,  into  people  that  are  seen  as  valuable  only  for  what  they  own,  and  not  for  what  they  are.  Capitalism  requires  a  powerful  military  industry  for  its  processes  of  accumulation  and  imposition  of  control  over  territories  and  natural  resources,  suppressing  the  resistance  of  the  peoples.  It  is  an  imperialist  system  of  colonization  of  the  planet.  Humanity  confronts  a  great  dilemma:  to  continue  on  the  path  of  capitalism,  depredation,  and  death,  or  to  choose  the  path  of  harmony  with  nature  and  respect  for  life.  It  is  imperative  that  we  forge  a  new  system  that  restores  harmony  with  nature  and  among  human  beings.  And  in  order  for  there  to  be  balance  with  nature,  there  must  first  be  equity  among  human  beings.  We  propose  to  74  the  peoples  of  the  world  the  recovery,  revalorization,  and  strengthening  of  the  knowledge,  wisdom,  and  ancestral  practices  of  Indigenous  Peoples,  which  are  affirmed  in  the  thought  and  practices  of  “Living  Well,”  recognizing  Mother  Earth  as  a  living  being  with  which  we  have  an  indivisible,  interdependent,  complementary  and  spiritual  relationship.  To  face  climate  change,  we  must  recognize  Mother  Earth  as  the  source  of  life  and  forge  a  new  system  based  on  the  principles  of:  –  Harmony  and  balance  among  all  and  with  all  things;  –  Complementarity,  solidarity,  and  equality;  –  Collective  well-­‐being  and  the  satisfaction  of  the  basic  necessities  of  all;  –  People  in  harmony  with  nature;  –  Recognition  of  human  beings  for  what  they  are,  not  what  they  own;  –  Elimination  of  all  forms  of  colonialism,  imperialism  and  interventionism;  –  Peace  among  the  peoples  and  with  Mother  Earth.  The  model  we  support  is  not  a  model  of  limitless  and  destructive  development.  All  countries  need  to  produce  the  goods  and  services  necessary  to  satisfy  the  fundamental  needs  of  their  populations,  but  by  no  means  can  they  continue  to  follow  the  path  of  development  that  has  led  the  richest  countries  to  have  an  ecological  footprint  five  times  bigger  than  what  the  planet  is  able  to  support.  Currently,  the  regenerative  capacity  of  the  planet  has  been  already  exceeded  by  more  than  30  percent.  If  this  pace  of  over-­‐  exploitation  of  our  Mother  Earth  continues,  we  will  need  two  planets  by  the  year  2030.  In  an  interdependent  system  in  which  human  beings  are  only  one  component,  it  is  not  possible  to  recognize  rights  only  to  the  human  part  without  provoking  an  imbalance  in  the  system  as  a  whole.  To  guarantee  human  rights  and  to  restore  harmony  with  nature,  it  is  necessary  to  effectively  recognize  and  apply  the  rights  of  Mother  Earth.  For  this  purpose,  we  propose  the  attached  project  for  the  Universal  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth,  in  which  it’s  recorded  that:  –  The  right  to  live  and  to  exist;  –  The  right  to  be  respected;  –  The  right  to  regenerate  its  bio-­‐capacity  and  to  continue  its  vital  cycles  and  processes  free  of  human  alteration;  –  The  right  to  maintain  their  identity  and  integrity  as  differentiated  beings,  self-­‐  regulated  and  interrelated;  –  The  right  to  water  as  the  source  of  life;  –  The  right  to  clean  air;  –  The  right  to  comprehensive  health;  –  The  right  to  be  free  of  contamination  and  pollution,  free  of  toxic  and  radioactive  waste;  –  The  right  to  be  free  of  alterations  or  modifications  of  its  genetic  structure  in  a  manner  that  threatens  its  integrity  or  vital  and  healthy  functioning;  –  The  right  to  prompt  and  full  restoration  for  violations  to  the  rights  acknowledged  in  this  Declaration  caused  by  human  activities.  75  The  “shared  vision”  seeks  to  stabilize  the  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  to  make  effective  the  Article  2  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  which  states  that  “the  stabilization  of  greenhouse  gases  concentrations  in  the  atmosphere  to  a  level  that  prevents  dangerous  anthropogenic  inferences  for  the  climate  system.”  Our  vision  is  based  on  the  principle  of  historical  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities,  to  demand  the  developed  countries  to  commit  with  quantifiable  goals  of  emission  reduction  that  will  allow  to  return  the  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  to  300  ppm,  therefore  the  increase  in  the  average  world  temperature  to  a  maximum  of  one  degree  Celsius.  Emphasizing  the  need  for  urgent  action  to  achieve  this  vision,  and  with  the  support  of  peoples,  movements  and  countries,  developed  countries  should  commit  to  ambitious  targets  for  reducing  emissions  that  permit  the  achievement  of  short-­‐term  objectives,  while  maintaining  our  vision  in  favor  of  balance  in  the  Earth’s  climate  system,  in  agreement  with  the  ultimate  objective  of  the  Convention.  The  “shared  vision  for  long-­‐term  cooperative  action”  in  climate  change  negotiations  should  not  be  reduced  to  defining  the  limit  on  temperature  increases  and  the  concentration  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere,  but  must  also  incorporate  in  a  balanced  and  integral  manner  measures  regarding  capacity  building,  production  and  consumption  patterns,  and  other  essential  factors  such  as  the  acknowledging  of  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth  to  establish  harmony  with  nature.  Developed  countries,  as  the  main  cause  of  climate  change,  in  assuming  their  historical  responsibility,  must  recognize  and  honor  their  climate  debt  in  all  of  its  dimensions  as  the  basis  for  a  just,  effective,  and  scientific  solution  to  climate  change.  In  this  context,  we  demand  that  developed  countries:  –  Restore  to  developing  countries  the  atmospheric  space  that  is  occupied  by  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  This  implies  the  decolonization  of  the  atmosphere  through  the  reduction  and  absorption  of  their  emissions;  –  Assume  the  costs  and  technology  transfer  needs  of  developing  countries  arising  from  the  loss  of  development  opportunities  due  to  living  in  a  restricted  atmospheric  space;  –  Assume  responsibility  for  the  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  that  will  be  forced  to  migrate  due  to  the  climate  change  caused  by  these  countries,  and  eliminate  their  restrictive  immigration  policies,  offering  migrants  a  decent  life  with  full  human  rights  guarantees  in  their  countries;  –  Assume  adaptation  debt  related  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  developing  countries  by  providing  the  means  to  prevent,  minimize,  and  deal  with  damages  arising  from  their  excessive  emissions;  –  Honor  these  debts  as  part  of  a  broader  debt  to  Mother  Earth  by  adopting  and  implementing  the  United  Nations  Universal  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth.  The  focus  must  not  be  only  on  financial  compensation,  but  also  on  restorative  justice,  understood  as  the  restitution  of  integrity  to  our  Mother  Earth  and  all  its  beings.  We  deplore  attempts  by  countries  to  annul  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  which  is  the  sole  legally  binding  instrument  specific  to  the  reduction  76  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  developed  countries.  We  inform  the  world  that,  despite  their  obligation  to  reduce  emissions,  developed  countries  have  increased  their  emissions  by  11.2%  in  the  period  from  1990  to  2007.  During  that  same  period,  due  to  unbridled  consumption,  the  United  States  of  America  has  increased  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  16.8%,  reaching  an  average  of  20  to  23  tons  of  CO2  per-­‐person.  This  represents  9  times  more  than  that  of  the  average  inhabitant  of  the  “Third  World,”  and  20  times  more  than  that  of  the  average  inhabitant  of  Sub-­‐Saharan  Africa.  We  categorically  reject  the  illegitimate  “Copenhagen  Accord”  that  allows  developed  countries  to  offer  insufficient  reductions  in  greenhouse  gases  based  in  voluntary  and  individual  commitments,  violating  the  environmental  integrity  of  Mother  Earth  and  leading  us  toward  an  increase  in  global  temperatures  of  around  4°C.  The  next  Conference  on  Climate  Change  to  be  held  at  the  end  of  2010  in  Mexico  should  approve  an  amendment  to  the  Kyoto  Protocol  for  the  second  commitment  period  from  2013  to  2017  under  which  developed  countries  must  agree  to  significant  domestic  emissions  reductions  of  at  least  50%  based  on  1990  levels,  excluding  carbon  markets  or  other  offset  mechanisms  that  mask  the  failure  of  actual  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  We  require  first  of  all  the  establishment  of  a  goal  for  the  group  of  developed  countries  to  achieve  the  assignment  of  individual  commitments  for  each  developed  country  under  the  framework  of  complementary  efforts  among  each  one,  maintaining  in  this  way  Kyoto  Protocol  as  the  route  to  emissions  reductions.  The  United  States,  as  the  only  Annex  1  country  on  Earth  that  did  not  ratify  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  has  a  significant  responsibility  toward  all  peoples  of  the  world  to  ratify  this  document  and  commit  itself  to  respecting  and  complying  with  emissions  reduction  targets  on  a  scale  appropriate  to  the  total  size  of  its  economy.  We  the  peoples  have  the  equal  right  to  be  protected  from  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change  and  reject  the  notion  of  adaptation  to  climate  change  as  understood  as  a  resignation  to  impacts  provoked  by  the  historical  emissions  of  developed  countries,  which  themselves  must  adapt  their  modes  of  life  and  consumption  in  the  face  of  this  global  emergency.  We  see  it  as  imperative  to  confront  the  adverse  effects  of  climate  change,  and  consider  adaptation  to  be  a  process  rather  than  an  imposition,  as  well  as  a  tool  that  can  serve  to  help  offset  those  effects,  demonstrating  that  it  is  possible  to  achieve  harmony  with  nature  under  a  different  model  for  living.  It  is  necessary  to  construct  an  Adaptation  Fund  exclusively  for  addressing  climate  change  as  part  of  a  financial  mechanism  that  is  managed  in  a  sovereign,  transparent,  and  equitable  manner  for  all  States.  This  Fund  should  assess  the  impacts  and  costs  of  climate  change  in  developing  countries  and  needs  deriving  from  these  impacts,  and  monitor  support  on  the  part  of  developed  countries.  It  should  also  include  a  mechanism  for  compensation  for  current  and  future  damages,  loss  of  opportunities  due  to  extreme  and  gradual  climactic  events,  and  additional  costs  that  could  present  77  themselves  if  our  planet  surpasses  ecological  thresholds,  such  as  those  impacts  that  present  obstacles  to  “Living  Well.”  The  “Copenhagen  Accord”  imposed  on  developing  countries  by  a  few  States,  beyond  simply  offering  insufficient  resources,  attempts  as  well  to  divide  and  create  confrontation  between  peoples  and  to  extort  developing  countries  by  placing  conditions  on  access  to  adaptation  and  mitigation  resources.  We  also  assert  as  unacceptable  the  attempt  in  processes  of  international  negotiation  to  classify  developing  countries  for  their  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  generating  disputes,  inequalities  and  segregation  among  them.  The  immense  challenge  humanity  faces  of  stopping  global  warming  and  cooling  the  planet  can  only  be  achieved  through  a  profound  shift  in  agricultural  practices  toward  the  sustainable  model  of  production  used  by  indigenous  and  rural  farming  peoples,  as  well  as  other  ancestral  models  and  practices  that  contribute  to  solving  the  problem  of  agriculture  and  food  sovereignty.  This  is  understood  as  the  right  of  peoples  to  control  their  own  seeds,  lands,  water,  and  food  production,  thereby  guaranteeing,  through  forms  of  production  that  are  in  harmony  with  Mother  Earth  and  appropriate  to  local  cultural  contexts,  access  to  sufficient,  varied  and  nutritious  foods  in  complementarity  with  Mother  Earth  and  deepening  the  autonomous  (participatory,  communal  and  shared)  production  of  every  nation  and  people.  Climate  change  is  now  producing  profound  impacts  on  agriculture  and  the  ways  of  life  of  indigenous  peoples  and  farmers  throughout  the  world,  and  these  impacts  will  worsen  in  the  future.  Agribusiness,  through  its  social,  economic,  and  cultural  model  of  global  capitalist  production  and  its  logic  of  producing  food  for  the  market  and  not  to  fulfill  the  right  to  proper  nutrition,  is  one  of  the  principal  causes  of  climate  change.  Its  technological,  commercial,  and  political  approach  only  serves  to  deepen  the  climate  change  crisis  and  increase  hunger  in  the  world.  For  this  reason,  we  reject  Free  Trade  Agreements  and  Association  Agreements  and  all  forms  of  the  application  of  Intellectual  Property  Rights  to  life,  current  technological  packages  (agrochemicals,  genetic  modification)  and  those  that  offer  false  solutions  (biofuels,  geo-­‐  engineering,  nanotechnology,  etc.)  that  only  exacerbate  the  current  crisis.  We  similarly  denounce  the  way  in  which  the  capitalist  model  imposes  mega-­‐infrastructure  projects  and  invades  territories  with  extractive  projects,  water  privatization,  and  militarized  territories,  expelling  indigenous  peoples  from  their  lands,  inhibiting  food  sovereignty  and  deepening  socio-­‐  environmental  crisis.  We  demand  recognition  of  the  right  of  all  peoples,  living  beings,  and  Mother  Earth  to  have  access  to  water,  and  we  support  the  proposal  of  the  Government  of  Bolivia  to  recognize  water  as  a  Fundamental  Human  Right.  The  definition  of  forests  used  in  the  negotiations  of  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  which  includes  plantations,  is  unacceptable.  Monoculture  plantations  are  not  forests.  Therefore,  we  require  a  definition  for  negotiation  purposes  that  recognizes  the  native  forests,  jungles  and  the  diverse  ecosystems  on  Earth.  78  The  United  Nations  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  Indigenous  Peoples  must  be  fully  recognized,  implemented  and  integrated  in  climate  change  negotiations.  The  best  strategy  and  action  to  avoid  deforestation  and  degradation  and  protect  native  forests  and  jungles  is  to  recognize  and  guarantee  collective  rights  to  lands  and  territories,  especially  considering  that  most  of  the  forests  are  located  within  the  territories  of  indigenous  peoples  and  nations  and  other  traditional  communities.  We  condemn  market  mechanisms  such  as  REDD  (Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation)  and  its  versions  +  and  +  +,  which  are  violating  the  sovereignty  of  peoples  and  their  right  to  prior  free  and  informed  consent  as  well  as  the  sovereignty  of  national  States,  the  customs  of  Peoples,  and  the  Rights  of  Nature.  Polluting  countries  have  an  obligation  to  carry  out  direct  transfers  of  the  economic  and  technological  resources  needed  to  pay  for  the  restoration  and  maintenance  of  forests  in  favor  of  the  peoples  and  indigenous  ancestral  organic  structures.  Compensation  must  be  direct  and  in  addition  to  the  sources  of  funding  promised  by  developed  countries  outside  of  the  carbon  market,  and  never  serve  as  carbon  offsets.  We  demand  that  countries  stop  actions  on  local  forests  based  on  market  mechanisms  and  propose  non-­‐  existent  and  conditional  results.  We  call  on  governments  to  create  a  global  program  to  restore  native  forests  and  jungles,  managed  and  administered  by  the  peoples,  implementing  forest  seeds,  fruit  trees,  and  native  flora.  Governments  should  eliminate  forest  concessions  and  support  the  conservation  of  petroleum  deposits  in  the  ground  and  urgently  stop  the  exploitation  of  hydrocarbons  in  forestlands.  We  call  upon  States  to  recognize,  respect  and  guarantee  the  effective  implementation  of  international  human  rights  standards  and  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples,  including  the  United  Nations  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  Indigenous  Peoples  under  ILO  Convention  169,  among  other  relevant  instruments  in  the  negotiations,  policies  and  measures  used  to  meet  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change.  In  particular,  we  call  upon  States  to  give  legal  recognition  to  claims  over  territories,  lands  and  natural  resources  to  enable  and  strengthen  our  traditional  ways  of  life  and  contribute  effectively  to  solving  climate  change.  We  demand  the  full  and  effective  implementation  of  the  right  to  consultation,  participation  and  prior,  free  and  informed  consent  of  indigenous  peoples  in  all  negotiation  processes,  and  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  measures  related  to  climate  change.  Environmental  degradation  and  climate  change  are  currently  reaching  critical  levels,  and  one  of  the  main  consequences  of  this  is  domestic  and  international  migration.  According  to  projections,  there  were  already  about  25  million  climate  migrants  by  1995.  Current  estimates  are  around  50  million,  and  projections  suggest  that  between  200  million  and  1  billion  people  will  become  displaced  by  situations  resulting  from  climate  change  by  the  year  2050.  Developed  countries  should  assume  responsibility  for  climate  migrants,  welcoming  them  into  their  territories  and  recognizing  their  fundamental  rights  through  the  signing  of  international  conventions  that  provide  for  the  definition  of  climate  migrant  79  and  require  all  States  to  abide  by  abide  by  determinations.  Establish  an  International  Tribunal  of  Conscience  to  denounce,  make  visible,  document,  judge  and  punish  violations  of  the  rights  of  migrants,  refugees  and  displaced  persons  within  countries  of  origin,  transit  and  destination,  clearly  identifying  the  responsibilities  of  States,  companies  and  other  agents.  Current  funding  directed  toward  developing  countries  for  climate  change  and  the  proposal  of  the  Copenhagen  Accord  are  insignificant.  In  addition  to  Official  Development  Assistance  and  public  sources,  developed  countries  must  commit  to  a  new  annual  funding  of  at  least  6%  of  GDP  to  tackle  climate  change  in  developing  countries.  This  is  viable  considering  that  a  similar  amount  is  spent  on  national  defense,  and  that  5  times  more  have  been  put  forth  to  rescue  failing  banks  and  speculators,  which  raises  serious  questions  about  global  priorities  and  political  will.  This  funding  should  be  direct  and  free  of  conditions,  and  should  not  interfere  with  the  national  sovereignty  or  self-­‐determination  of  the  most  affected  communities  and  groups.  In  view  of  the  inefficiency  of  the  current  mechanism,  a  new  funding  mechanism  should  be  established  at  the  2010  Climate  Change  Conference  in  Mexico,  functioning  under  the  authority  of  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and  held  accountable  to  it,  with  significant  representation  of  developing  countries,  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  funding  commitments  of  Annex  1  countries.  It  has  been  stated  that  developed  countries  significantly  increased  their  emissions  in  the  period  from  1990  to  2007,  despite  having  stated  that  the  reduction  would  be  substantially  supported  by  market  mechanisms.  The  carbon  market  has  become  a  lucrative  business,  commodifying  our  Mother  Earth.  It  is  therefore  not  an  alternative  for  tackle  climate  change,  as  it  loots  and  ravages  the  land,  water,  and  even  life  itself.  The  recent  financial  crisis  has  demonstrated  that  the  market  is  incapable  of  regulating  the  financial  system,  which  is  fragile  and  uncertain  due  to  speculation  and  the  emergence  of  intermediary  brokers.  Therefore,  it  would  be  totally  irresponsible  to  leave  in  their  hands  the  care  and  protection  of  human  existence  and  of  our  Mother  Earth.  We  consider  inadmissible  that  current  negotiations  propose  the  creation  of  new  mechanisms  that  extend  and  promote  the  carbon  market,  for  existing  mechanisms  have  not  resolved  the  problem  of  climate  change  nor  led  to  real  and  direct  actions  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases.  It  is  necessary  to  demand  fulfillment  of  the  commitments  assumed  by  developed  countries  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  regarding  development  and  technology  transfer,  and  to  reject  the  “technology  showcase”  proposed  by  developed  countries  that  only  markets  technology.  It  is  essential  to  establish  guidelines  in  order  to  create  a  multilateral  and  multidisciplinary  mechanism  for  participatory  control,  management,  and  evaluation  of  the  exchange  of  technologies.  These  technologies  must  be  useful,  clean  and  socially  sound.  Likewise,  it  is  fundamental  to  establish  a  fund  for  the  financing  and  inventory  of  technologies  that  are  appropriate  and  free  of  intellectual  property  80  rights.  Patents,  in  particular,  should  move  from  the  hands  of  private  monopolies  to  the  public  domain  in  order  to  promote  accessibility  and  low  costs.  Knowledge  is  universal,  and  should  for  no  reason  be  the  object  of  private  property  or  private  use,  nor  should  its  application  in  the  form  of  technology.  Developed  countries  have  a  responsibility  to  share  their  technology  with  developing  countries,  to  build  research  centers  in  developing  countries  for  the  creation  of  technologies  and  innovations,  and  defend  and  promote  their  development  and  application  for  “living  well.”  The  world  must  recover  and  re-­‐learn  ancestral  principles  and  approaches  from  native  peoples  to  stop  the  destruction  of  the  planet,  as  well  as  promote  ancestral  practices,  knowledge  and  spirituality  to  recuperate  the  capacity  for  “living  well”  in  harmony  with  Mother  Earth.  Considering  the  lack  of  political  will  on  the  part  of  developed  countries  to  effectively  comply  with  commitments  and  obligations  assumed  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol,  and  given  the  lack  of  a  legal  international  organism  to  guard  against  and  sanction  climate  and  environmental  crimes  that  violate  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth  and  humanity,  we  demand  the  creation  of  an  International  Climate  and  Environmental  Justice  Tribunal  that  has  the  legal  capacity  to  prevent,  judge  and  penalize  States,  industries  and  people  that  by  commission  or  omission  contaminate  and  provoke  climate  change.  Supporting  States  that  present  claims  at  the  International  Climate  and  Environmental  Justice  Tribunal  against  developed  countries  that  fail  to  comply  with  commitments  under  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  and  the  Kyoto  Protocol  including  commitments  to  reduce  greenhouse  gases.  We  urge  peoples  to  propose  and  promote  deep  reform  within  the  United  Nations,  so  that  all  member  States  comply  with  the  decisions  of  the  International  Climate  and  Environmental  Justice  Tribunal.  The  future  of  humanity  is  in  danger,  and  we  cannot  allow  a  group  of  leaders  from  developed  countries  to  decide  for  all  countries  as  they  tried  unsuccessfully  to  do  at  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  in  Copenhagen.  This  decision  concerns  us  all.  Thus,  it  is  essential  to  carry  out  a  global  referendum  or  popular  consultation  on  climate  change  in  which  all  are  consulted  regarding  the  following  issues;  the  level  of  emission  reductions  on  the  part  of  developed  countries  and  transnational  corporations,  financing  to  be  offered  by  developed  countries,  the  creation  of  an  International  Climate  Justice  Tribunal,  the  need  for  a  Universal  Declaration  of  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth,  and  the  need  to  change  the  current  capitalist  system.  The  process  of  a  global  referendum  or  popular  consultation  will  depend  on  process  of  preparation  that  ensures  the  successful  development  of  the  same.  In  order  to  coordinate  our  international  action  and  implement  the  results  of  this  “Accord  of  the  Peoples,”  we  call  for  the  building  of  a  Global  People’s  Movement  for  Mother  Earth,  which  should  be  based  on  the  principles  of  complementarity  and  respect  for  the  diversity  of  origin  and  visions  among  its  members,  constituting  a  broad  and  democratic  space  for  coordination  and  joint  worldwide  actions.  81  To  this  end,  we  adopt  the  attached  global  plan  of  action  so  that  in  Mexico,  the  developed  countries  listed  in  Annex  1  respect  the  existing  legal  framework  and  reduce  their  greenhouse  gases  emissions  by  50%,  and  that  the  different  proposals  contained  in  this  Agreement  are  adopted.  Finally,  we  agree  to  undertake  a  Second  World  People’s  Conference  on  Climate  Change  and  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth  in  2011  as  part  of  this  process  of  building  the  Global  People’s  Movement  for  Mother  Earth  and  reacting  to  the  outcomes  of  the  Climate  Change  Conference  to  be  held  at  the  end  of  this  year  in  Cancún,  Mexico  [i].

The  Bolivian  government  has  submitted  it  to  the  United  Nations  for  consideration.  Preamble  We,  the  peoples  and  nations  of  Earth:  considering  that  we  are  all  part  of  Mother  Earth,  an  indivisible,  living  community  of  interrelated  and  interdependent  beings  with  a  common  destiny;  gratefully  acknowledging  that  Mother  Earth  is  the  source  of  life,  nourishment  and  learning  and  provides  everything  we  need  to  live  well;  recognizing  that  the  capitalist  system  and  all  forms  of  depredation,  exploitation,  abuse  and  contamination  have  caused  great  destruction,  degradation  and  disruption  of  Mother  Earth,  putting  life  as  we  know  it  today  at  risk  through  phenomena  such  as  climate  change;  convinced  that  in  an  interdependent  living  community  it  is  not  possible  to  recognize  the  rights  of  only  human  beings  without  causing  an  imbalance  within  Mother  Earth;  affirming  that  to  guarantee  human  rights  it  is  necessary  to  recognize  and  defend  the  rights  of  Mother  Earth  and  all  beings  in  her  and  that  there  are  existing  cultures,  practices  and  laws  that  do  so;  conscious  of  the  urgency  of  taking  decisive,  collective  action  to  transform  structures  and  systems  that  cause  climate  change  and  other  threats  to  Mother  Earth;  proclaim  this  Universal  Declaration  of  the  Rights  of  Mother  Earth,  and  call  on  the  General  Assembly  of  the  United  Nation  to  adopt  it,  as  a  common  standard  of  achievement  for  all  peoples  and  all  nations  of  the  world,  and  to  the  end  that  every  individual  and  institution  takes  responsibility  for  promoting  through  teaching,  education,  and  consciousness  raising,  respect  for  the  rights  recognized  in  this  Declaration  and  ensure  through  prompt  and  progressive  measures  and  mechanisms,  national  and  international,  their  universal  and  effective  recognition  and  observance  among  all  peoples  and  States  in  the  world.  Article  1.  Mother  Earth  (1)  Mother  Earth  is  a  living  being.  (2)  Mother  Earth  is  a  unique,  indivisible,  self-­‐  regulating  community  of  interrelated  beings  that  sustains,  contains  and  reproduces  all  beings.  (3)  Each  being  is  defined  by  its  relationships  as  an  integral  part  of  Mother  Earth.  (4)  The  inherent  rights  of  Mother  Earth  are  inalienable  in  that  they  arise  from  the  same  source  as  existence.  (5)  Mother  Earth  and  all  beings  are  entitled  to  all  the  inherent  rights  recognized  in  this  Declaration  without  distinction  of  any  kind,  such  as  may  be  made  between  organic  and  inorganic  beings,  species,  origin,  use  to  human  beings,  or  any  other  status.  (6)  Just  as  human  beings  have  human  rights,  all  other  beings  also  have  rights  which  are  specific  to  their  species  or  kind  and  appropriate  for  their  role  and  function  within  the  communities  within  which  they  exist.  (7)  The  rights  of  each  being  are  limited  by  the  rights  of  other  beings  and  any  conflict  85  between  their  rights  must  be  resolved  in  a  way  that  maintains  the  integrity,  balance  and  health  of  Mother  Earth.  Article  2.  Inherent  Rights  of  Mother  Earth  (1)  Mother  Earth  and  all  beings  of  which  she  is  composed  have  the  following  inherent  rights:  (a)  the  right  to  life  and  to  exist;  (b)  the  right  to  be  respected;  (c)  the  right  to  regenerate  its  bio-­‐capacity  and  to  continue  its  vital  cycles  and  processes  free  from  human  disruptions;  (d)  the  right  to  maintain  its  identity  and  integrity  as  a  distinct,  self-­‐regulating  and  interrelated  being;  (e)  the  right  to  water  as  a  source  of  life;  (f)  the  right  to  clean  air;  (g)  the  right  to  integral  health;  (h)  the  right  to  be  free  from  contamination,  pollution  and  toxic  or  radioactive  waste;  (i)  the  right  to  not  have  its  genetic  structure  modified  or  disrupted  in  a  manner  that  threatens  it  integrity  or  vital  and  healthy  functioning;  (j)  the  right  to  full  and  prompt  restoration  the  violation  of  the  rights  recognized  in  this  Declaration  caused  by  human  activities;  (2)  Each  being  has  the  right  to  a  place  and  to  play  its  role  in  Mother  Earth  for  her  harmonious  functioning.  (3)  Every  being  has  the  right  to  wellbeing  and  to  live  free  from  torture  or  cruel  treatment  by  human  beings.  Article  3.  Obligations  of  human  beings  to  Mother  Earth  (1)  Every  human  being  is  responsible  for  respecting  and  living  in  harmony  with  Mother  Earth.  (2)  Human  beings,  all  States,  and  all  public  and  private  institutions  must:  (a)  act  in  accordance  with  the  rights  and  obligations  recognized  in  this  Declaration;  (b)  recognize  and  promote  the  full  implementation  and  enforcement  of  the  rights  and  obligations  recognized  in  this  Declaration;  (c)  promote  and  participate  in  learning,  analysis,  interpretation  and  communication  about  how  to  live  in  harmony  with  Mother  Earth  in  accordance  with  this  Declaration;  (d)  ensure  that  the  pursuit  of  human  wellbeing  contributes  to  the  wellbeing  of  Mother  Earth,  now  and  in  the  future;  (e)  establish  and  apply  effective  norms  and  laws  for  the  defence,  protection  and  conservation  of  the  rights  of  Mother  Earth;  (f)  respect,  protect,  conserve  and  where  necessary,  restore  the  integrity,  of  the  vital  ecological  cycles,  processes  and  balances  of  Mother  Earth;  (g)  guarantee  that  the  damages  caused  by  human  violations  of  the  inherent  rights  recognized  in  this  Declaration  are  rectified  and  that  those  responsible  are  held  accountable  for  restoring  the  integrity  and  health  of  Mother  Earth;  (h)  empower  human  beings  and  institutions  to  defend  the  rights  of  Mother  Earth  and  of  all  beings;  (i)  establish  precautionary  and  restrictive  measures  to  prevent  human  activities  from  causing  species  extinction,  the  destruction  of  ecosystems  or  the  disruption  of  ecological  cycles;  (j)  guarantee  peace  and  eliminate  nuclear,  chemical  and  biological  weapons;  (k)  promote  and  support  practices  of  respect  for  Mother  Earth  and  all  beings,  in  accordance  with  their  own  cultures,  traditions  and  customs;  (l)  promote  economic  systems  that  are  in  harmony  with  Mother  Earth  and  in  accordance  with  the  rights  recognized  in  this  Declaration.  86  Article  4.  Definitions  (1)  The  term  “being”  includes  ecosystems,  natural  communities,  species  and  all  other  natural  entities  which  exist  as  part  of  Mother  Earth.  (2)  Nothing  in  this  Declaration  restricts  the  recognition  of  other  inherent  rights  of  all  beings  or  specified  beings.  87  The  Margarita  Declaration  on  Climate  Change  Preparatory  Meeting,  Venezuela,  July  18,  2014,  Margarita  Island,  Social  PreCOP  Changing  the  system,  not  the  climate    es/archivos/margarita_declaration_on_climat  e_change.pdf  We,  women  and  men  representing  social  movements  and  organizations,  gathered  in  Margarita  Island  from  July  15th  thru  18th,  2014,  committed  to  the  Good  Living,  in  harmony  with  the  ecosystems  of  the  Earth  as  a  way  to  counteract  the  current  environmental  crisis  and  the  climate  change,  one  of  its  most  ferocious  faces;  concerned  by  the  social  dimension  of  this  crisis  that  has  been  ignored  for  long,  but  filled  with  hope  and  faith  in  the  creating  powers  of  the  peoples  as  the  necessary  driving  force  to  achieve  substantial  changes  in  the  system;  salute  and  welcome  the  social  processes  that  are  being  lived  and  constructed  in  various  countries,  communities  and  model  societies.  Whereas,  there  is  a  social  dimension  of  the  climate  change  and  an  unalienable  right  of  the  peoples  to  be  the  protagonists  in  the  construction  of  their  own  destinies;  Whereas,  each  country  lives  in  a  particular  historic  context  within  a  complex  world  made  up  by  diversity  of  experiences  and  visions  from  which  transformational  initiatives  rise;  Whereas,  the  climate  crisis  results  from  unsustainable  development  systems  that  are  incompatible  with  the  happiness  of  the  peoples;  Whereas,  the  environment  is  a  political  issue  and  it  is  the  duty  of  the  governments  and  the  multilateral  system  to  hear  the  voices  of  the  peoples;  Whereas,  the  peoples  endure  the  consequences  of  the  climate  change,  and  are  the  ones  who  live  and  understand  its  social  dimensions,  and  whereas  they  are  the  actors  that  have  the  moral  strength  and  the  creative  capacity  necessary  to  change  course  towards  systems  that  are  fair  and  sustainable  enabling  a  lasting  happiness  in  harmony  with  the  cycles  of  nature;  Whereas,  the  developing  countries  are  faced  with  various  kinds  of  problems  and  endure  more  and  major  consequences  of  climate  change  than  the  developed  countries;  Hereby  declare:  As  to  the  INTERGENERATIONAL  EQUALITY  AND  RIGHTS  OF  THE  FUTURE  GENERATIONS  “Let  us  go  to  the  future,  let  us  bring  it  and  sow  it  here”  Hugo  Chávez  1.  “Men  and  women  have  become  consumerist  monsters  that  consume  all  the  resources  given  by  the  Earth”.  Génesis  Carmona,  aged  11,  elected  representative  of  the  Venezuelan  Children  Environment  Movements.  2.  We  must  share  our  experiences  from  all  over  the  world  to  understand  and  construct  true  solutions.  Expressing  solidarity  to  88  comrades  in  other  parts  of  the  world  means  understanding  their  context,  understanding  their  struggle  for  life,  sovereignty  and  identity.  3.  Change  depends  on  the  capacity  of  our  generation  to  produce  a  counterculture,  transform  the  consumption  model  into  Good  Living  and  global  cooperative  societies.  We  must  generate  a  revolutionary  counterculture.  The  task  of  youth  is  to  open  roads  and  generate  cracks  in  a  system  that  is  unsustainable.  4.  Youth  must  be  politicized  and  empowered.  Most  importantly,  youth  must  have  the  will  and  the  capacity  to  transform  things.  We  must  change  the  system  and  begin  to  mobilize  our  best  efforts.  It  is  not  an  environmental  issue  alone;  it  is  an  issue  that  is  deeply  social,  ethical,  political  and  cultural.  5.  We  must  change  our  perception  of  power  and  promote  diverse  and  inclusive  spaces,  open  to  intercultural  thinking.  We  must  move  from  the  discourse  to  a  transforming  action.  6.  The  world  needs  corrective  actions  before  damages  become  irreversible.  We  denounce  the  lack  of  political  will  of  the  wealthiest  countries.  7.  Education  must  look  like  the  society  we  dream  of.  It  must  be  revolutionary  and  transform  reality.  If  it  cannot  undertake  such  transformations,  it  does  not  work.  Education  and  communication  are  the  cornerstones  for  transformation.  8.  The  environmental  issue  must  be  a  pillar  in  curricula.  It  is  necessary  to  re-­‐think  the  way  how  people  are  educated  on  environment  and  Climate  Change.  We  need  to  open  new  spaces  where  the  ultimate  causes  of  the  environmental  crisis  are  discussed.  Youth  need  to  promote  such  changes.  The  hegemonic  system  is  frightened  of  peoples  that  are  educated  because  they  may  call  into  question  the  structures  power.  9.  Colonialism  continues  to  operate.  Climate  change  occurs  within  a  historic  context  where  a  group  of  countries  based  their  development  on  practices  generating  the  current  environmental  crisis,  including  Climate  Change,  while  others  suffer  the  worst  consequences.  The  developed  countries  causing  the  Climate  Change  intend  to  side-­‐  track  the  discussion  towards  technological  or  market  solutions,  thus  eluding  their  historic  responsibilities.  10.  The  struggles  of  the  South  must  be  supported  in  the  countries  of  the  North.  The  wealthiest  countries  must  commit  themselves  to  finding  a  solution  to  the  Climate  Change.  Youth  in  the  North  must  exert  pressure  on  their  governments  in  that  sense.  There  is  not  much  time  left,  the  global  North  must  take  on  its  historic  responsibility  and  youth  must  exert  pressure  for  this  to  happen.  11.  We  need  to  recover  the  notion  of  solidarity,  understand  the  differences  existing  among  the  countries,  their  different  historic  contexts,  the  right  to  Good  Living  and  also  the  responsibilities  of  development.  Transition  may  not  be  restricted  to  a  reduction  of  emissions.  It  has  to  be  a  fair  transition  guaranteeing  that  the  peoples  of  the  South  will  not  be  adversely  affected.  12.  We  need  to  create  our  own  dreams,  forget  the  perverse  developmentalist  dream,  and  find  inspiration  in  ourselves.  We  need  to  share  a  new  narrative  based  on  our  own  experiences.

It  is  necessary  to  reach  an  alternative  development  model  based  on  the  principles  of  living  in  harmony  with  nature,  guided  by  absolute  and  ecological  sustainability  limits,  and  the  capacity  of  mother  Earth  as  well;  a  fair,  egalitarian  model  that  constructs  sustainable  economies  that  moves  us  away  from  energy  models  based  on  fossil  fuels  and  hazardous  energies,  that  guarantees  and  recognizes  the  respect  to  Mother  Earth,  the  rights  of  women,  children,  adolescents,  gender  diversity,  the  impoverished,  the  vulnerable  minority  groups  and  the  original  indigenous  peoples  –  A  fair  and  egalitarian  model  that  fosters  the  peaceful  coexistence  of  our  peoples.  We  likewise  want  a  society  where  the  right  of  Mother  Earth  prevails  over  neoliberal  policies,  economic  globalization  and  patriarchy,  because  without  Mother  Earth  life  does  not  exist.  14.  The  main  sources  for  climate  crisis  are  the  political  and  economic  systems  commercializing  and  reifying  nature  and  life,  thus  impoverishing  spirituality  and  imposing  consumerism  and  developmentalism  that  generate  unequal  regimes  and  exploitation  of  resources.  This  global  crisis  is  exacerbated  by  unsustainable  practices  of  exploitation  and  consumption  by  the  developed  countries  and  the  elites  of  the  developing  countries.  We  demand  the  leaders  in  the  North  not  to  continue  such  wicked  practices  that  destroy  the  planet  and  demand  the  leaders  in  the  South  not  to  follow  the  development  models  in  place  in  the  North  which  lead  to  this  civilizing  crisis.  We  urge  them  to  construct  an  alternative  path  to  achieve  fair,  egalitarian  and  sustainable  societies  and  fair  economies.  For  such  purposes,  it  is  required  that  the  developed  countries  meet  their  moral  and  legal  obligations,  especially  vis-­‐à-­‐vis  vulnerable  and  marginalized  countries  and  communities  by  lifting  barriers  such  as  intellectual  property  rights  which  prevent  the  attainment  of  the  preservation  of  life  over  the  planet  and  the  salvation  of  human  species.  We  likewise  urge  them  to  comply  with  the  financial  contribution  and  the  transfer  of  safe  and  locally  suitable  technologies  free  from  barriers  such  as  intellectual  property  rights,  strengthen  capacities  and  embrace  the  principles  set  forth  in  the  Climate  Change  Convention  and  in  the  Rio  Earth  Summit,  especially  as  to  the  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  capabilities,  and  the  principles  of  precaution  and  gender  equality.  15.  According  to  scientific  evidence,  in  order  not  to  exceed  1.5  degrees  increase  of  temperature,  it  becomes  necessary  not  to  produce  80%  of  the  fossil  fuel  reserves  known.  For  this  purpose,  the  developed  countries  require  to  immediately  reduce  consumption  and  production  of  fossil  fuels.  Also,  they  need  to  recognize  the  rights  of  the  developing  countries  that  rely  on  the  production  of  fossil  fuels  as  a  source  of  revenues.  The  developing  countries  require  time  for  a  fair  transition  to  reduce  their  dependence  on  such  activity,  as  the  developed  countries  should  provide  unconditional  assistance  to  the  developing  nations  so  that  the  latter  may  carry  out  such  urgent  transition.  16.  We  demand  the  change  of  the  production  and  consumption  patterns  taking  into  account  the  historic  responsibilities  of  the  90  emissions  from  nations  and  corporations  and  their  cumulative  nature,  thus  recognizing  that  the  carbon  atmospheric  space  is  finite  and  needs  to  be  equally  distributed  amongst  the  countries  and  their  peoples.  17.  The  historically  unequal  overconsumption  of  the  global  emissions  budget  managed  by  mainstream  corporations  and  economic  systems  has  contributed  to  cause  inequalities  in  terms  of  the  capacities  of  the  countries.  Some  key  indicators  to  measure  such  disparity  would  be  the  national  per  capita  emission  of  greenhouse  effect  gases  since  1850,  the  distribution  and  size  of  the  wealth  and  national  income,  and  the  technological  resources  owned  by  a  country.  Such  indicators  may  be  used  to  determine  the  fair  portion  of  effort  corresponding  to  each  country  (emissions  budget)  if  the  Earth  limits  are  respected  and  if  the  historic  responsibilities,  the  needs  for  sustainable  development,  the  losses  and  damages  caused  by  climate  change  and  the  need  of  technology  transfer  and  financial  support  are  recognized.  18.  We  demand  the  implementation  of  a  Justice,  Ethics  and  Moral  Court  on  Climate  Change,  where  humanity  at  large  may  file  complaints  against  crimes  related  to  this  topic.  19.  We  reject  any  attempt  to  implement  or  promote  dangerous  and  unethical  solutions  or  responses  to  Climate  Change,  solutions  whereby  wealthy  industrialized  countries  and  corporations  ultimately  seek  to  use  climate  change  as  a  means  for  profit.  Some  of  such  false  responses,  such  as  carbon  production  and  soils,  whereas  the  implementation  of  the  “United  Nations  Program  on  Reducing  Emissions  from  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation  in  Developing  Countries  (UN-­‐  REDD)”  and  the  production  of  agrofuels,  have  already  caused  seizure  and  fragmentation  of  lands.  As  to  the  Social  Impact  of  Climate  Change  20.  The  environment  is  a  political  issue,  which  has  to  do  with  power,  and  therefore  it  is  necessary  that  the  peoples  and  the  social  movements  are  empowered  and  participate  on  the  making  of  the  decisions  that  affect  them.  21.  Risk  management  must  have  deep  social  and  local  roots,  and  include  national,  local  and  community-­‐based  risk  alert,  prevention  and  management  systems  as  an  essential  part  of  the  adaptation  process.  22.  Planning  must  be  participative  and  lean  towards  a  habitat  (either  urban  or  rural)  constructed  and  managed  by  everybody  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  inhabitants  in  their  specific  contexts  of  action.  23.  It  is  necessary  to  generate  structural  changes  in  the  mainstream  production,  distribution  and  consumption  models  that  reject  the  commodification  of  nature  as  a  solution  to  climate  change.  24.  We  demand  the  repair  of  historic  debts,  and  reject  the  financing  proposals  which  do  not  bring  about  effective  transformations  for  a  sustainable  solution.  25.  Buen  Vivir  (Good  Living)  practices  should  be  promoted:  To  feel  good,  live  fully  and  stay  in  balance  and  harmony  with  the  others,  and  respect  the  cycles  of  life  and  the  Mother  Earth.  91  26.  We  must  promote  territory  participative  management  by  fostering  social  dialogue  and  ensuring  the  participation  of  women  in  the  decision-­‐making  and  in  the  implementation  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  mechanisms  vis-­‐  à-­‐vis  climate  change.  27.  It  is  necessary  to  recover  the  ancestral  technologies  and  promote  the  training  and  support  of  popular  technology  experts  with  the  capacity  to  create  new  technologies  which  contribute  to  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  climate  change.  28.  Communities  must  have  access  to  information  on  the  Climate  Change  negotiations  through  strategies  devised  for  such  purposes.  29.  We  must  include  Climate  Change  as  a  topic  in  the  curriculum  at  all  levels  and  in  the  programs  of  all  disciplines,  focusing  on  the  structural  causes  for  climate  change.  30.  It  is  necessary  to  design  strategies  to  guarantee  social  security  of  workers  and  the  dialogue  between  them  and  the  governments  in  the  transition  to  a  new  economic  model  that  respond  to  Climate  Change  problems.  31.  Forms  of  penalization,  penalties  and  repair  mechanisms  are  necessary  for  crimes  against  nature.  Violation  of  Human  Rights  need  to  be  seen  not  only  as  a  weapons  use  problem,  but  also  as  a  result  of  other  forms  of  aggression,  such  as  the  pollution  of  the  Earth  by  the  use  of  agrotoxics  and  the  restriction  of  access  to  water.  32.  Promote  small-­‐scale  family  farming  without  agrotoxics  as  an  alternative  economic  model  that  guarantees  good  and  healthy  nourishment  for  the  peoples.  As  to  Social  Participation  in  the  Decision-­‐making  33.  We  must  organize  ourselves  to  guarantee  life  on  the  planet  through  a  great  world  social  movement.  A  change  of  attitude  for  a  conscience  of  power  keeping  the  peoples  united  becomes  necessary.  As  organized  peoples  we  can  push  for  the  transformation  of  the  system.  34.  We  must  guarantee  compliance  with  the  Convention,  especially  in  the  matter  concerning  the  participation  of  the  Social  Movements  and  Organizations.  35.  The  current  spaces  need  to  be  broadened,  and  new  broad  and  permanent  spaces  for  participation  need  to  be  created  so  that  Social  Movements  and  Organizations  may  contribute  their  proposals  to  guide  the  decisions  in  the  negotiation  process  of  the  Convention.  36.  It  is  necessary  to  establish  nationwide  information  and  full  citizen  participation  mechanisms  to  be  aware  and  include  the  vision  of  the  peoples  with  regard  to  climate  problems  and  promote  transparency  in  the  dissemination  of  information  on  the  status  of  the  negotiation  of  the  Convention.  37.  The  accreditation  and  financing  mechanisms  for  participation  shall  be  revised  and  improved  so  that  they  do  not  constitute  an  obstacle  that  hinders  effective  participation  of  the  Social  Movements  and  Organization  in  the  negotiation  process  of  the  Convention.  38.  Transparency  and  access  to  relevant  and  adequate  information  in  the  processes  associated  with  the  participation  of  Social  92  Movements  and  Organizations  in  the  Convention  are  to  be  guaranteed.  39.  It  is  important  to  take  into  account  diversity  in  the  forms  of  social  organization  as  basis  to  broaden  their  participation  on  the  Convention.  40.  We  must  propose  the  creation  of  a  high-­‐  level  committee  to  restructure  the  participation  mechanisms  in  the  Convention.  It  should  include  social  movements  and  Non-­‐  Governmental  Organizations  and  count  on  the  participation  of  countries  with  significant  experience  on  this  issue.  41.  We  reject  the  interference  of  the  corporations  in  the  decisions  of  the  United  Nations  Organizations  to  the  prejudice  of  the  rights  of  the  Peoples  and  the  sovereignty  of  the  States.  42.  Citizen  consultation  processes  need  to  be  established  to  guide  the  decision-­‐making  of  each  government  within  the  Convention,  such  as  national  consultation  referenda  with  a  direct  impact  on  the  climate  agreement.  43.  We  demand  the  UN  the  public  dissemination  and  access  to  the  sessions,  meetings  and  negotiations  with  translation  in  the  languages  of  the  peoples.  44.  Material  conditions  need  to  be  guaranteed,  such  as  time,  space  and  the  necessary  resources  for  the  mobilization  and  participation  of  social  movements  and  organizations  in  the  processes  associated  with  the  negotiations  on  climate  change  and  binding  topics  within  the  UN.  45.  It  is  necessary  that  the  ancestral  knowledge  of  the  Peoples  be  deemed  as  equally  important  and  valuable  as  scientific  knowledge  for  decision-­‐making  and  for  actions  against  climate  change  by  the  UN  and  by  the  governments.  46.  We  demand  that  the  use  of  specialized  language  and  the  profusion  of  acronyms  in  the  UN  do  not  constitute  exclusion  mechanisms  preventing  the  understanding  of  the  climate  negotiation  process  by  the  peoples  of  the  world.  47.  Synergies  should  be  created  between  the  governments  and  the  Social  Movements  and  Non-­‐Governmental  Organizations  to  promote  the  attendance  of  the  latter  to  the  work  sessions  and  their  coordinated  participation  on  the  decision  making  of  the  negotiation  process.  As  to  Fighting  Climate  Change:  Direct  Action  for  Transformation  46.  The  structural  causes  for  climate  change  are  linked  to  the  current  capitalist  hegemonic  system.  Fighting  the  climate  change  involves  changing  the  system.  47.  The  change  of  the  system  must  provide  for  a  transformation  of  the  economic,  political,  social  and  cultural  systems  at  local,  national,  regional  and  global  levels.  48.  Education  is  a  right  of  the  peoples,  a  continuous  process  of  fair,  free,  and  transversal  comprehensive  training.  Education  is  one  of  the  fundamental  driving  forces  for  transformation  and  construction  in  diversity  of  the  new  women  and  men,  for  the  Good  Living  and  the  respect  of  life  and  Mother  Earth.  49.  Education  should  be  oriented  to  reflect  value,  create,  raise  awareness,  coexist,  93  participate  and  act.  When  we  speak  of  education  to  face  the  climate  change,  we  speak  of  the  main  roots  of  such  change  and  the  historic  and  current  responsibilities.  We  also  speak  of  poverty,  inequality  and  vulnerability  of  the  peoples,  especially  the  indigenous  peoples  and  other  historically  excluded  and  victimized  groups.  50.  Social  participation  is  a  fundamental  driving  force  for  transformation.  It  is  necessary  to  facilitate  the  integration  of  social  movements  and  include  the  peoples  and  their  organizations  in  the  decision-­‐  making  process  at  all  levels.  51.  Any  transformation  mechanism  must  include  the  principles  of  respect  to  life  and  human  rights;  sovereignty  of  the  peoples,  solidarity,  fair  transition  and  the  recognition  of  the  ecological  limits  and  the  rights  of  Mother  Earth.  It  should  also  consider  the  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities;  the  ancestral  character  of  the  indigenous  peoples,  the  various  forms  and  degrees  of  vulnerability  of  the  countries  and  the  peoples,  especially  the  indigenous  peoples  and  other  historically  excluded  and  victimized  human  groups.  52.  We  reject  the  implementation  of  false  solutions  to  climate  change,  such  as:  carbon  markets  and  other  forms  of  privatization  and  commodification  of  life;  geo-­‐engineering,  agrofuels  productions,  and  measures  favoring  agribusiness  and  harming  the  production  of  food  in  an  agro  ecological  manner,  such  as  the  use  of  transgenic  seeds  and  agrotoxics,  synthetic  fertilizers  and  any  other  measure  lessening  the  priority  of  the  right  to  Good  Living,  health  and  the  eradication  of  poverty  enshrined  in  the  Convention.  We  likewise  reject  the  green  economy,  the  intellectual  property  rights;  the  mega  water  dam  projects,  monocultures  and  nuclear  energy.  53.  It  is  necessary  to  know  and  take  into  account  the  extraterritorial  effects  of  climate  solutions.  54.  We  propose  the  following  actions  to  change  the  system:  o  Transformation  of  the  power  relations  and  the  decisionmaking  systems  for  the  construction  of  an  anti-­‐patriarchal  people’s  power.  o  Transformation  of  food  production  systems  into  agro  ecological  systems,  thus  ensuring  food  sovereignty  and  security  and  valuing  knowledge,  innovations,  ancestral  and  traditional  practices.  o  Transformation  of  the  energy  production  systems,  eradicating  dirty  energies  respecting  the  right  of  the  peoples  to  fight  poverty  and  keeping  fair  transition  as  a  guiding  principle.  o  Transformation  of  the  energy  consumption  patterns  through  education,  regulations  to  large  energy  consumers  and  empowerment  of  the  people  over  community-­‐scaled  systems  of  renewable  energies  production  under  control  of  the  communities.  Implement  participative  government  of  territory  and  city  planning  systems,  thus  ensuring  fair  and  sustainable  access  to  land  and  to  urban  services,  as  well  as  other  means  that  are  necessary  to  face  the  Climate  Change  impacts.  o  Shift  from  an  energy  and  materials  profligate  system  to  a  cyclic  system  that  emphasizes  the  eradication  of  the  unsustainable  exploitation  of  nature  and  94  promotes  reduction,  reutilization  and  recycling  of  residues.  o  Ensure  the  financing  by  the  developed  countries  to  developing  countries  for  such  transformations,  and  for  compensation  and  rehabilitation  of  the  impacts  of  Climate  Change.  Financing  must  not  be  conditioned,  and  the  management  of  the  funds  supplied  shall  be  in  the  hands  of  the  Peoples.  o  Create  accessible  mechanisms  for  the  protection  of  the  displaced  people  and  the  defenders  of  the  environmental  rights.  As  to  the  North-­‐South  Responsibilities:  Commitments  of  the  North  to  Promote  Actions  in  the  South  55.  The  financing  of  mitigation  and  adaptation  actions  by  the  developed  countries  in  the  developing  countries  is  a  moral  and  legal  obligation  under  the  Convention  by  virtue  of  the  historic  responsibilities  of  the  former.  Funding  must  be  reliable,  predictable,  sufficient  and  adequate.  56.  All  obligations  of  the  countries  in  the  North  in  relation  to  finance,  technology  transfer  and  support  for  the  compensation  of  losses  and  damages  should  be  legally  binding  under  the  Climate  Change  Convention.  57.  Financing  mechanisms  must  not  respond  to  the  logics  of  market  supply  and  demand,  but  to  compliance  with  responsibilities.  It  must  be  guaranteed  that  funds  promote  development  and  reach  the  most  vulnerable  communities.  58.  Technology  transfer  from  countries  in  the  North  to  the  South  must  promote  the  process  of  appropriation,  innovation  and  endogenous  technology  development.  In  this  connection,  it  is  essential  to  consider  specific  mechanisms  to  lift  the  barriers  created  by  intellectual  property  rights.  South-­‐South  technology  transfer  and  cooperation  need  also  to  be  promoted,  and  the  value  of  the  knowledge  of  the  ancestral  people  and  of  the  senior  citizens  as  well.  59.  Adaptation  transcends  the  construction  of  infrastructure.  Injustice,  marginalization  and  social  exclusion  adversely  impact  on  the  vulnerability  and  the  possibility  to  adapt.  These  aspects  need  to  be  considered  in  the  Climate  Change  adaptation  programs  and  in  the  financial  mechanisms.  60.  Loss  and  damages  caused  by  Climate  Change  must  be  considered  from  the  perspective  of  justice  and  human  rights.  The  governments  of  the  South  must  receive  from  the  North  the  necessary  funds  to  compensate  loss  and  damages.  South-­‐South  solidarity  systems  need  to  be  endorsed.  The  experience  of  Venezuela’s  assistance  to  Caribbean  countries  and  their  massive  housing  programs  constitute  an  example  of  solidarity  vis-­‐à-­‐vis  the  loss  and  damages  generated  by  climate  change.  61.  The  military  sector  is  one  of  the  main  consumers  of  fossil  fuels  and  one  of  the  largest  gas-­‐emission  contributors  in  the  planet.  This  needs  to  be  included  in  the  global  discussions  on  Climate  Change.  The  military  sector  shall  be  responsible  and  accountable.  62.  Our  task  as  civil  society  is  to  work  for  the  transformation  of  our  societies  and  the  production  and  consumption  systems  which  constitute  the  cause  for  climate  change  by  generating  new  development  paradigms  determined  by  the  peoples.  Part  of  this  task  95  needs  to  aim  at  influencing  the  national  governments  and  international  settings  such  as  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change.  96  A  Zero  Emissions  Manifesto  for  the  Climate  Justice  Movement  Tom  Weis,  President,  Climate  Crisis  Solutions  Rev.  Lennox  Yearwood,  President  and  CEO,  Hip  Hop  Caucus  Posted:  /2014  11:54  am  EDT  Updated:  /2014  7:59  pm  EDT    emissions-­‐manifesto-­‐climate-­‐change/  “Zero  emissions  is  an  ambitious  but  achievable  goal.“  –UN  Secretary-­‐General  Ban  Ki-­‐moon  Zero  has  become  the  most  important  number  for  humanity.  Why?  Any  chance  of  stabilizing  the  climate  hinges  on  transitioning  to  zero  greenhouse  gas  emissions  as  quickly  as  humanly  possible.  Simply  slowing  the  rise  of  emissions  will  not  work.  For  the  first  time,  the  world’s  leading  climate  authority,  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  has  embraced  a  goal  of  near  zero  greenhouse  gas  emissions  or  below.  Top  military  experts  and  government  institutions  like  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  and  National  Intelligence  Council  warn  that  climate  destabilization  threatens  our  national  security,  yet  global  emissions  just  keep  going  up.  Leading  biologists  like  E.O.  Wilson  warn  that  the  sixth  great  extinction  is  now  upon  us,  yet  emissions  keep  going  up.  By  heating  the  globe  at  such  a  relentless  rate,  we  are  playing  a  deadly  game  of  planetary  Russian  roulette.  In  the  words  of  Michael  Mann,  professor  of  meteorology  at  Penn  State  University:  “There  is  no  precedent  for  what  we  are  doing  to  the  atmosphere.  It  is  an  uncontrolled  experiment.”  If  you  believe  your  own  eyes  that  climate  chaos  has  already  gone  too  far,  the  only  logical  response  is  to  stop  making  things  worse.  We  are  not  suggesting  ending  the  use  of  fossil  fuels  tomorrow.  Decarbonizing  our  industries,  homes,  transportation,  power  generation  and  food  production  will  take  years  of  concerted  effort  and  require  every  ounce  of  courage,  ingenuity,  patience  and  humility  we  possess.  But  intergenerational  justice  demands  that  we  commit  ourselves  now  as  a  nation  to  leading  this  green  industrial  revolution.  Some  will  no  doubt  call  this  goal  unrealistic,  saying  it  cannot  be  achieved,  but  they  would  underestimate  the  creative  genius  of  the  American  people.  What  is  unrealistic  is  thinking  we  can  continue  with  business  as  usual  and  leave  a  habitable  planet  for  our  children.  Americans  are  a  supremely  resourceful  people  with  a  long  history  of  meeting,  and  exceeding,  monumental  challenges.  While  we  have  never  faced  anything  as  daunting  as  the  global  climate  crisis,  there  are  precedents  for  the  U.S.  overcoming  seemingly  insurmountable  odds.  When  destiny  came  knocking  during  World  War  II,  we  initially  resisted,  then  answered  by  leading  the  allied  forces  to  victory  in  three  and  a  half  short  years.  It  took  a  Civil  War  to  end  the  scourge  of  slavery,  and  a  monumental  civil  rights  struggle  to  outlaw  segregation,  Jim  Crow  laws  and  discrimination,  but  we  not  only  overcame,  we  elected  a  person  of  color  as  President  of  the  United  States.  97  When  President  John  Kennedy  boldly  challenged  America  to  land  a  man  on  the  moon  in  less  than  a  decade,  our  best  and  brightest  responded  by  accomplishing  this  seemingly  impossible  task  ahead  of  schedule.  It  is  now  time  for  our  generation  to  do  something  great.  Zero  Emissions  Bandwagon  It  may  surprise  you  to  learn  that  zero  emissions  has  already  been  embraced  as  a  goal  by  business  leaders  as  well-­‐known  as  Bill  Gates,  and  world  leaders  as  prominent  as  UN  Secretary-­‐General  Ban  Ki-­‐moon;  OECD  Secretary-­‐General  Angel  Gurria;  UN  climate  chief  Christiana  Figueres;  Prince  Charles;  and  former  President  Jimmy  Carter,  former  UN  Secretary-­‐General  Kofi  Annan,  and  Archbishop  Desmond  Tutu  of  The  Elders.  Again,  even  the  conservative,  consensus-­‐  based  IPCC  supports  near  zero  emissions  or  below,  albeit  on  a  year  2100  timeline  that  belies  the  urgency  of  their  August  draft  report,  which  warns  of  “irreversible  impacts”  from  continued  emissions.  Major  corporations,  like  Google,  have  embraced  a  zero  carbon  goal.  Others  like  Microsoft  and  Deutsche  Bank  are  moving  in  this  direction  by  committing  to  net  zero  emissions,  or  carbon  neutrality  (using  carbon  offsets  or  carbon  credits  to  balance  out  remaining  emissions).  684  college  and  university  presidents  (and  growing)  have  taken  a  similar  climate  neutrality  pledge.  And  a  fossil  fuel  divestment  movement  is  picking  up  steam  on  college  campuses  (including  Stanford  University,  Sydney  University  and  historically  black  colleges  and  universities)  and  in  houses  of  worship  around  the  world.  Sweden,  Iceland,  Costa  Rica  and  the  Maldives  are  among  the  nations  vying  for  carbon  neutrality.  Denmark  is  committed  to  becoming  fossil  fuel  free,  with  Copenhagen  seeking  to  become  the  world’s  first  carbon-­‐  neutral  capital  by  2025.  In  the  U.S.,  cities  like  Austin  and  Boulder  are  striving  for  carbon  neutrality,  with  San  Francisco  pledging  to  generate  all  of  its  electricity  from  renewables  by  2020.  Scotland  is  on  track  to  generate  100  percent  of  its  electricity  from  renewables  by  2020.  The  Philippines  aims  to  shift  the  country’s  fuel  system  to  100  percent  renewables  in  ten  years.  The  German  state  of  Schleswig-­‐  Holstein  is  set  to  go  100  percent  renewable  this  year.  Munich’s  goal  is  100  percent  renewables  by  2025.  The  British  Labour  Party  wants  to  decarbonize  the  UK’s  electricity  grid  by  2030.  And  the  island  nation  of  Tokelau  is  already  100  percent  renewable.  In  stark  contrast,  neither  the  U.S.  President,  nor  a  single  member  of  the  U.S.  Congress,  has  yet  publicly  called  for  a  zero  emissions  goal  for  America.  2̊°C  Wrong  Target  Just  because  the  governments  of  the  world  accept  2°  Celsius  of  heating  above  the  preindustrial  average  as  the  agreed-­‐upon  target  does  not  make  it  the  right  target.  To  the  contrary,  last  December,  preeminent  climate  scientist  James  Hansen  and  seventeen  co-­‐authors  released  a  study  in  the  scientific  journal  PLOS  ONE  revealing  the  UN-­‐  approved  2°C  ceiling  is  based  on  politics,  not  science,  and  would  unleash  “disastrous  consequences”  beyond  our  control.  Dr.  Hansen,  economist  Jeffrey  Sachs,  and  others  argue  that  “morality”  demands  a  rapid  98  and  dramatic  cut  in  global  carbon  emissions  to  stay  as  close  as  possible  to  a  1°C  ceiling  (we  are  already  at  0.85°C).  Here’s  what  they  said  about  the  urgency  of  dropping  from  the  current  level  of  400  parts  per  million  (a  level  not  reached  in  at  least  800,000  years)  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  in  the  atmosphere  to  350  parts  per  million  (ppm),  the  level  many  consider  the  uppermost  safe  limit  for  civilization:  “It  is  instructive  to  see  how  fast  atmospheric  CO2  declines  if  fossil  fuel  emissions  are  instantly  terminated.  Halting  emissions  in  2015  causes  CO2  to  decline  to  350  ppm  at  century’s  end.  A  20  year  delay  in  halting  emissions  has  CO2  returning  to  350  ppm  at  about  2300.  With  a  40  year  delay,  CO2  does  not  return  to  350  ppm  until  after  3000.  These  results  show  how  difficult  it  is  to  get  back  to  350  ppm  if  emissions  continue  to  grow  for  even  a  few  decades.”  We’re  obviously  not  going  to  achieve  zero  emissions  by  2015.  The  point  is  we  need  to  do  it  as  soon  as  necessary  to  avoid  catastrophe  impacts  from  global  climate  change.  Every  day  we  delay  buries  us  deeper  in  the  climate  hole.  Failure  of  Moral  Leadership  The  United  Nations,  Congress  and  the  White  House  are  all  failing  in  their  moral  obligation  to  stem  the  tide  of  this  gathering  storm.  The  United  Nations  is  not  leading  on  this  issue,  as  it  must.  Since  1990,  when  the  IPCC  issued  its  first  report,  CO2  emissions  have  increased  by  approximately  sixty  percent.  Last  year  in  Warsaw,  after  19  successive  sessions  of  the  UN  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP)  failed  to  achieve  meaningful  emissions  reductions,  labor  and  environmental  groups  walked  out  after  deciding  governments  were  performing  so  poorly  they  could  no  longer  legitimize  the  climate  cop-­‐out  with  their  presence.  Congress  is  not  leading  on  this  issue,  as  it  must.  Since  refusing  to  ratify  the  1997  Kyoto  protocol,  the  U.S.  Congress  has  failed  to  enact  any  significant  climate  legislation.  The  closest  they  came  was  a  Wall  Street-­‐friendly  “cap  and  trade”  bill  passed  by  the  Democratic-­‐  controlled  House  of  Representatives  in  2009.  Described  as  an  “unacceptable  compromise”  by  Greenpeace  and  “a  step  backwards”  by  Friends  of  the  Earth,  it  called  for  a  modest  17  percent  reduction  of  carbon  emissions  by  2020.  Five  years  later,  too  few  members  of  the  Republican-­‐controlled  House  of  Representatives  are  even  willing  to  admit  humans  are  changing  the  climate.  The  White  House  is  not  leading  on  this  issue,  as  it  must.  The  EPA’s  proposed  rules  to  limit  carbon  pollution  from  existing  coal-­‐fired  power  plants  are  a  step  in  the  right  direction,  but  President  Obama’s  widely  heralded  “climate  action  plan”  will  be  more  PR  than  plan,  with  no  chance  of  stabilizing  the  climate,  unless  the  White  House  takes  bold  action.  In  fact,  the  administration’s  attempt  to  please  all  during  this  climate  crisis  with  its  all-­‐of-­‐the-­‐above  energy  strategy  promises  more  climate  chaos  by  promoting  natural  gas  fracking;  mountaintop  removal  mining;  deepwater  and  Arctic  oil  drilling;  tar  sands  mining;  and  deafening  seismic  oil  and  gas  exploration  off  the  Atlantic  coast.  That  the  President  has  not  yet  denounced  a  scheme  as  “absurdly  reckless”  as  Keystone  XL‘s  northern  leg  speaks  volumes.  Even  the  renewable  energy  industry  is  not  leading  on  this  issue,  as  it  must.  Four  years  after  it  was  first  pointed  out,  America’s  99  largest  wind,  solar  and  geothermal  trade  associations  continue  to  embrace  incrementalism,  when  the  times  call  for  revolutionary  change.  Because  the  climate  crisis  threatens  all  life  on  Earth,  it  is  first  and  foremost  a  moral  issue.  We  have  already  seen  how  the  poor  and  communities  of  color  bear  the  brutal  brunt  of  fossil  fuel  extraction  and  suffer  the  most  from  extreme  weather  disasters.  Three  out  of  four  African  Americans  live  within  30  miles  of  a  coal-­‐fired  power  plant.  African-­‐American  children  have  an  80  percent  higher  rate  of  asthma,  and  are  nearly  three  times  more  likely  to  die  from  asthma,  than  their  white  peers.  The  moral  urgency  of  this  crisis  requires  a  rainbow  coalition  of  people  -­‐  reflecting  the  diversity  of  our  great  nation  -­‐  coming  together  to  solve  it.  Alarmingly,  latest  projections  by  the  U.S.  Energy  Information  Administration  have  fossil  fuels  supplying  almost  80  percent  of  the  world’s  energy  use  through  2040,  with  carbon  dioxide  emissions  rising  46  percent  from  2010  levels.  If  this  perilous  trend  is  not  reversed,  runaway  climate  change  could  cause  most  of  life  on  Earth  to  go  extinct,  testing  the  survival  of  humanity  itself.  As  the  nation  that  historically  contributed  the  most  to  global  climate  pollution,  and  is  in  the  strongest  position  to  respond,  the  U.S.  has  a  moral  imperative  to  lead  this  global  charge.  Making  the  Great  Transition  It  is  time  for  America  to  unleash  its  entrepreneurial  can-­‐do  spirit  through  a  wartime-­‐like  mobilization  to  help  save  America,  and  the  world.  Innovating  to  zero  emissions  will  not  only  help  ensure  our  collective  survival,  it  is  the  key  to  revitalizing  our  ailing  economy  and  putting  America  back  to  work.  But  we  don’t  have  until  2100,  or  even  2050,  to  transition  off  of  fossil  fuels.  Scientists  are  calling  for  deep  cuts  in  emissions  now.  Leaders  showing  us  how  to  get  there  include:  • The  National  Renewable  Energy  Laboratory,  which  in  2012  commissioned  a  Renewable  Electricity  Futures  Study  showing  that  80%  of  all  U.S.  electricity  demand  can  be  met  with  currently  commercially  available  renewable  energy  technologies  at  the  hourly  level  every  day  of  the  year.  • Former  Vice  President  Al  Gore,  who  in  2008  boldly  called  for  100%  renewable  electricity  for  the  U.S.  by  2018.  • Lester  Brown,  who  in  2008  mapped  out  how  to  achieve  80%  carbon  cuts  worldwide  by  2020  in  his  authoritative  book  Plan  B.  • Marc  Jacobson  and  Mark  Delucchi,  who  in  2009  released  a  plan  to  power  the  planet  with  100  percent  renewables  by  2030,  a  vision  that  spawned  The  Solutions  Project  (a  plan  to  transition  all  50  states  to  100  percent  renewables).  • The  prestigious  Tyndall  Centre  for  Climate  Change  Research  in  London,  Zero  Carbon  Britain  and  Australia’s  Beyond  Zero  Emissions,  all  of  which  are  working  to  achieve  zero  emissions.  Zero  Emissions  Mandate  We  have  solutions.  They  even  have  names:  conservation;  energy  efficiency;  solar  power;  wind  power;  geothermal  power;  standing  forests;  organic  farms;  industrial  hemp;  100  electric  vehicles;  bicycles;  mass  transit;  wave  energy;  tidal  power;  zero  waste  ...  Here  and  there  aggressive  initiatives  are  underway.  China  is  developing  a  single  38,000  MW  wind  project  large  enough  to  electrify  a  country  the  size  of  Poland.  Four  states  in  Germany  already  get  more  than  50  percent  of  their  electricity  from  wind  power,  while  in  the  U.S.,  Iowa  and  South  Dakota  are  generating  more  than  25  percent  of  their  electricity  from  wind  farms.  But  progress  is  not  being  made  at  anything  close  to  a  speed  and  scale  commensurate  with  the  scope  of  the  planetary  emergency  we  face.  On,  Sept.  23,  a  UN  Climate  Summit  is  being  held  in  New  York  City.  UN  Secretary-­‐General  Ban  Ki-­‐moon  has  challenged  world  leaders  to  bring  their  pledges  to  set  the  world  on  a  low-­‐  carbon  path.  We  entreat  Mr.  Ban,  who  calls  zero  emissions  an  “achievable  goal,”  to  challenge  attendees  of  the  UN  Climate  Summit  to  bring  their  zero  emissions  plans  to  COP20  in  Peru  this  December  and  to  COP21  in  France  in  2015.  Anything  less  will  show  our  governments  are  not  serious  about  solving  this  existential  threat.  Our  colleague  Bill  McKibben,  who  earlier  this  year  called  out  the  Obama  administration  for  sabotaging  the  2009  Copenhagen  climate  negotiations  through  NSA  spying,  has  issued  a  “call  to  arms“  inviting  all  who  “give  a  damn  about  the  biggest  crisis  our  civilization  has  ever  faced”  to  gather  in  New  York  City  on  Sept.  21  for  a  People’s  Climate  March  to  demand  bold  climate  action  at  the  UN  Summit.  We  ask,  what  could  be  bolder  than  zero  emissions?  Earth  is  the  only  known  habitable  planet  in  the  universe,  making  the  climate  risks  to  humanity  so  great  as  to  warrant  the  utmost  precaution.  Now  is  the  time  for  the  climate  justice  movement  to  rally  around  a  goal  of  zero  emissions,  with  the  U.S.  leading  the  way  by  enacting  zero  emissions  policies  at  the  local,  state  and  federal  levels.  For  the  love  of  humanity,  and  our  children,  we  must  act  now.  Zero  emissions:  because  the  first  step  to  making  things  better  is  to  stop  making  things  worse.  101  The  Lima  Ecosocialist  Declaration  October  6,  2014    -­‐lima-­‐ecosocialist-­‐declaration/  Declaration  of  the  Ecosocialist  International  Network  before  COP20  in  Lima,  Peru  (December  2014)  Translated  by  Quincy  Saul  for  Ecosocialist  Horizons,  affiliate  of  the  Ecosocialist  International  Network.  Our  lives  are  worth  more  than  their  profits!  The  imminent  climate  crisis  that  we  confront  today  is  a  grave  threat  to  the  preservation  of  life  on  the  planet.  Many  academic  and  political  works  have  confirmed  the  fragility  of  life  on  earth  to  temperature  change.  Only  a  few  degrees  can  cause  –  and  are  causing  –  an  ecological  catastrophe  of  incalculable  consequences.  Now  we  are  experiencing  the  deadly  effects  of  this  situation.  The  melting  ice,  the  contamination  of  the  atmosphere,  rising  sea  levels,  desertification,  and  the  increasing  intensity  of  the  weather,  are  all  proof.  It  is  now  fundamental  to  ask  ourselves  who  and  what  is  causing  the  climate  to  change  like  this.  We  urgently  need  to  unmask  all  the  abstract  answers,  which  attempt  to  blame  all  of  humanity.  These  abstract  answers  disconnect  the  current  situation  from  the  historical  dynamics  which  have  emerged  from  fossil  fuel  (coal,  oil  gas)-­‐based  industrialization,  which  causes  global  warming,  and  the  logic  of  capitalism,  which  is  sustained  by  the  private  appropriation  of  wealth,  and  the  conquest  of  profit.  Profit  at  the  cost  of  social  exploitation  and  ecological  devastation:  these  are  two  faces  of  the  same  system,  which  is  the  culprit  of  climate  catastrophe.  (Illustration  by  Seth  Tobocman,  from  “Truth  and  Dare,”  Ecosocialist  Horizons)  In  this  panorama,  the  Conference  of  the  Parties  (COP),  organized  by  diverse  governments  and  funded  by  large  corporations,  confirms  the  responsibility  of  capitalism  for  the  climate  crisis,  by  putting  on  empty  events  without  any  effective  resolutions  capable  of  solving  the  problem.  In  fact,  we  are  moving  backwards,  a  retreat  expressed  in  the  ridiculous  “green  funds”  which  openly  profit  from  pollution.  Sadly,  this  dynamic  is  deepened  through  the  attitudes  sustained  by  multiple  governments  –  facilitating  pollution  and  putting  the  profits  of  corporations  above  the  wellbeing  of  people.  This  can  be  seen  most  strongly  in  the  102  countries  of  the  South,  and  thus  it  is  fundamental  to  comprehend  that  the  dynamics  of  this  system  tend  to  dump  the  global  ecological  crisis  upon  the  shoulders  of  the  oppressed  and  exploited  of  the  earth.  It  is  vital  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  the  diverse  social  and  ecological  struggles  all  over  the  world,  which  propose  to  stop  climate  change  and  the  ecological  crisis  through  the  logic  of  solidarity.  It  is  important  to  note  that  many  of  these  processes  are  launched  and  led  by  women.  Without  a  doubt,  the  Latin  American  scenario  today  exemplifies  the  mix  of  resistance,  self-­‐management  and  processes  of  transformation,  based  on  projects  which  can  unite  new  proposals  with  ancestral  cosmovisions.  One  example  can  be  found  in  the  brave  struggles  of  the  indigenous  peoples  and  campesinos  of  Peru,  in  particular  their  resistance  to  the  Conga  mega-­‐mining  project.  It  is  also  useful  to  focus  our  attention  on  the  experience  of  the  Yasuni  Park,  which  was  the  initiative  of  indigenous  and  ecological  movements  –  to  protect  a  large  region  of  Amazon  rain  forest  from  oil  drilling,  in  exchange  for  payments  from  rich  nations  to  the  people  of  Ecuador.  The  government  of  Rafael  Correa  accepted  the  proposal  for  several  years,  but  recently  decided  to  open  the  park  to  multinational  oil  corporations,  provoking  important  protests.  Another  case  can  be  found  in  the  development  projects  which  the  Brazilian  government  is  attempting  to  carry  out,  which  threaten  a  large  part  of  Amazonia  with  destruction.  From  this  perspective,  there  is  very  little  to  hope  for  at  COP20  this  December  in  Lima,  Peru.  If  there  is  any  escape  from  climate  change  and  the  global  ecological  crisis,  it  will  emerge  from  the  power  of  struggle  and  the  organization  of  the  oppressed  and  exploited  peoples  of  the  world,  with  the  understanding  that  the  struggle  for  a  world  without  ecological  devastation  must  connect  to  the  struggle  for  a  society  without  oppression  or  exploitation.  This  change  must  begin  now,  bringing  together  unique  struggles,  daily  efforts,  processes  of  self-­‐management,  and  reforms  to  slow  the  crisis,  with  a  vision  centered  on  a  change  of  civilization;  a  new  society  in  harmony  with  nature.  This  is  the  central  proposal  of  ecosocialism,  an  alternative  to  our  current  ecological  catastrophe.  Change  the  system,  not  the  climate!

He  is  a  Director  on  the  national  board  of  the  Sierra  Club—one  of  the  largest  and  oldest  US  environmental  organizations.  Dorsey  is  a  recognized  expert  on  global  governance,  finance  and  sustainability.  In  1992,  he  was  a  member  of  the  U.S.  State  Department  Delegation  to  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Environment  and  Development,  “The  Earth  Summit.”  From  1994-­‐96  he  was  a  task  force  member  of  President  William  Jefferson  Clinton’s  Council  on  Sustainable  Development.  In  1997,  in  Glasgow,  Scotland,  Dorsey  was  bestowed  Rotary  International’s  highest  honor,  The  Paul  Harris  Medal  for  Distinguished  Service  to  Humanity.  From  April  2007  until  November  2008  Dr.  Dorsey  was  a  member  of  Senator  Barack  Obama’s  energy  and  environment  Presidential  campaign  team.  In  2010  Lisa  Jackson,  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (US-­‐EPA)  Administrator,  appointed  Dr.  Dorsey  to  the  EPA’s  National  Advisory  Committee  (NAC).  Administrator  Jackson  reappointed  Dr.  Dorsey  to  the  US-­‐EPA  NAC  in  2012.  In  2013  Dr.  Dorsey  was  made  a  “Full  member”  of  the  Club  of  Rome;  that  same  year  the  National  Journal  named  Dr.  Dorsey  one  of  200  national  “energy  and  environment  expert  insiders”.  John  Foran  has  taught  sociology  at  the  University  of  California,  Santa  Barbara  since  1989.

Since  attending  the  COP15  in  Copenhagen  in  2009,  he  has  taken  constant  inspiration  from  the  global  climate  justice  movement,  which  he  teaches,  researches,  and  speaks  about  whenever  he  can  (he  has  been  accused  of  talking  about  nothing  else).  Foran  is  engaged  in  a  long-­‐term  participatory  action  project  with  the  global  climate  justice  movement,  and  with  Dr.  Richard  Widick,  he  also  co-­‐  directs  the  International  Institute  of  Climate  105  Action  &  Theory  (IICAT)  ()  and  is  a  founding  member  of  the  Climate  Justice  Project,  where  his  blog  posts  can  be  found.  He  is  also  active  in  the  Green  Party,  350.org,  and  System  Change  Not  Climate  Change.  He  has  written  and  writes  for  a  number  of  on-­‐  line  publications  about  these  struggles  (see  his  work  here  and  here).  Pascoe  Sabido  has  been  with  Corporate  Europe  Observatory  in  Brussels  since  January  2013,  focusing  on  industry  influence  over  policy  making  within  the  European  institutions  and  internationally.  His  current  focus  is  on  exposing  the  role  of  dirty  industry  lobbying  in  climate  policy  making  –  at  the  national,  regional  (EU),  and  UN  level.  He  previously  worked  as  an  international  renewable  energy  campaigner  at  Friends  of  the  Earth  England,  Wales  and  Northern  Ireland,  focusing  on  community-­‐owned  and  controlled  energy  alternatives  (see  the  book  chapter  “Reclaiming  Power  –  an  energy  model  for  people  and  the  planet,”  with  Niclas  Hällström,  in  What  Next  Volume  III:  Climate,  Development  and  Equity;  and  the  book  Powering  Africa  Through  Feed-­‐in  Tariffs).

OCI-2016-6.txt,"WHY THE PARIS CLIMATE GOALS REQUIRE A  MANAGED DECLINE OF FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION  PUBLISHED IN COLLABORATION WITH  THE SKY’S LIMIT  SEPTEMBER 2016  Australian Youth Climate Coalition  This report was researched and written by Greg Muttitt with  contributions from Hannah McKinnon, Lorne Stockman,  Steve Kretzmann, Adam Scott, and David Turnbull. It was  edited by Collin Rees. All are with Oil Change International.  Oil Change International is a research, communications, and  advocacy organization focused on exposing the true costs  of fossil fuels and facilitating the coming transition towards  clean energy.      In December 2015, world governments agreed to limit global average temperature  rise to well below 2°C, and to strive to limit it to 1.5°C. This report examines, for the  first time, the implications of these climate boundaries for energy production and use.  Our key findings are:  Y The potential carbon emissions from the oil, gas, and coal in the world’s currently  operating fields and mines would take us beyond 2°C of warming.  Y The reserves in currently operating oil and gas fields alone, even with no coal,  would take the world beyond 1.5°C.  Y With the necessary decline in production over the coming decades to meet climate  goals, clean energy can be scaled up at a corresponding pace, expanding the total  number of energy jobs.  One of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest: stop digging for  more fossil fuels. We therefore recommend:  Y No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built, and  governments should grant no new permits for them.  Y Some fields and mines – primarily in rich countries – should be closed before fully  exploiting their resources, and financial support should be provided for non-carbon  development in poorer countries.  Y This does not mean stopping using all fossil fuels overnight. Governments and  companies should conduct a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry and ensure  a just transition for the workers and communities that depend on it.  In August 2015, just months before the Paris climate talks, President Anote Tong of the  Pacific island nation of Kiribati called for an end to construction of new coal mines and  coal mine expansions. This report expands his call to all fossil fuels.    ENOUGH ALREADY  The Paris Agreement aims to help the world avoid the worst effects of climate change  and respond to its already substantial impacts. The basic climate science involved is  simple: cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over time are the key determinant  of how much global warming occurs.a This gives us a finite carbon budget of how much  may be emitted in total without surpassing dangerous temperature limits.  We consider carbon budgets that would give a likely (66%) chance of limiting global  warming below the 2°C limit beyond which severe dangers occur, or a medium (50%)  chance of achieving the 1.5°C goal. Fossil fuel reserves – the known below-ground  stocks of extractable fossil fuels – significantly exceed these budgets. For the 2°C or  1.5°C limits, respectively 68% or 85% of reserves must remain in the ground.  This report focuses on the roughly 30% of reserves in oil fields, gas fields, and coal  mines that are already in operation or under construction. These are the sites where  the necessary wells have been (or are being) drilled, the pits dug, and the pipelines,  processing facilities, railways, and export terminals constructed. These developed  reserves are detailed in Figure ES-1, along with assumed future emissions from the two  major non-energy sources of emissions: land use and cement manufacture.  We see that – in the absence of a major change in the prospects of carbon capture and  storage (CCS):b  Y The oil, gas, and coal in already-producing fields and mines are more than we can  afford to burn while keeping likely warming below 2°C.  Y The oil and gas alone are more than we can afford for a medium chance of keeping  to 1.5°C.    Figure ES-1: Emissions from Developed Fossil Fuel Reserves, Plus Projected Land Use and Cement Manufacture  Sources: Rystad Energy, International Energy Agency (IEA), World Energy Council, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  a The carbon budgets approach does not apply to other greenhouse gases, whose effects are factored into the calculation of carbon budgets in the form of  assumptions about their future emissions.  b CCS has not been successfully deployed at scale despite major efforts, and there are doubts as to whether it will ever be affordable or environmentally safe.  6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  WHEN YOU’RE IN A HOLE, STOP DIGGING  Traditional climate policy has largely focused on regulating at the point of emissions,  while leaving the supply of fossil fuels to the market. If it ever was, that approach is  no longer supportable. Increased extraction leads directly to higher emissions, through  lower prices, infrastructure lock-in, and perverse political incentives. Our analysis  indicates a hard limit to how much fossil fuel can be extracted, which can  be implemented only by governments:  Y No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built,  and governments should grant no new permits for them.c  Continued construction would either commit the world to exceeding 2°C of warming,  and/or require an abrupt end to fossil fuel production and use at a later date (with  increasing severity depending on the delay). Yet right now, projected investment in  new fields, mines, and transportation infrastructure over the next twenty years is  $14 trillion – either a vast waste of money or a lethal capital injection. The logic is  simple: whether through climate change or stranded assets, a failure to begin a  managed decline now would inevitably entail major economic and social costs.  The good news is that there is already progress toward stopping new fossil fuel  development. China and Indonesia have declared moratoria on new coal mine  development, and the United States has done so on federal lands. These three  countries account for roughly two-thirds of the world’s current coal production.  In 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposed Keystone XL tar sands  pipeline by noting that some fossil fuels should be left in the ground, and there  is growing recognition of the importance of a climate test in decisions regarding  new fossil fuel infrastructure.d There is an urgent need to make the coal moratoria  permanent and worldwide, and to stop new oil and gas development as well.  Ending new fossil fuel construction would bring us much closer to staying within our  carbon budgets, but it is still not enough to achieve the Paris goals. To meet them,  some early closure of existing operations will be required. Every country should do  its fair share, determined by its capacity to act, along with its historic responsibility  for causing climate change. With just 18% of the world’s population, industrialized  countries have accounted for over 60% of emissions to date, and possess far greater  financial resources to address the climate problem.  Most early closures should therefore take place in industrialized countries, beginning  with (but not limited to) coal. While politically pragmatic, the approach of stopping  new construction tends to favor countries with mature fossil fuel industries; therefore,  part of their fair share should include supporting other countries on the path of  development without fossil fuels, especially in providing universal access to energy.  Therefore:  Y Some fields and mines – primarily in rich countries – should be closed before fully  exploiting their reserves, and financial support should be provided for non-carbon  development in poorer countries.  Additionally, production should be discontinued wherever it violates the rights of local  people – including indigenous peoples – or where it seriously damages biodiversity.  c This does not mean stopping all capital investment in existing field and mines, only stopping the development of new ones (including new project phases).  d   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 7  A MANAGED DECLINE AND A JUST TRANSITION  Stopping new construction does not mean turning off the taps overnight. Existing  fields and mines contain a finite stock of extractable fossil fuels. Depleting these stocks,  even including some early closures, would entail a gradual transition in which extraction  rates would decline over a few decades. This is consistent with a rate of expansion of  clean energy that is both technically and economically possible.  We consider a simple modelling of world energy sources under two scenarios: 50%  renewable energy by 2035 and 80% by 2045, both with a complete phase-out of  coal usage, except in steel production. It is compared with the projected oil and gas  extraction from existing fields alone.  We conclude that:  Y While existing fields and mines are depleted over the coming decades, clean energy  can be scaled up at a corresponding pace.  While this pace of renewable energy expansion will require policy support, it continues  existing trends. In many countries – large and small, rich and poor – clean energy is  already being deployed at scale today. Denmark now generates more than 40% of  its electricity from renewable sources, Germany more than 30%, and Nicaragua 36%.  China is now the largest absolute generator of renewable electricity, and expanding  renewable generation quickly. In most contexts, the costs of wind and solar power  are now close to those of gas and coal; in some countries renewable costs are already  lower. The expansion of renewable energy will be harder where there are weak grids  in developing countries, hence the importance of climate finance in supporting a  non-carbon transition.  As for transportation, electric vehicles are now entering the mainstream and are on  course to soon be cheaper than gasoline or diesel cars. With sufficient policy support  and investment, the growth in clean energy can match the needed decline in fossil fuel  extraction and use.  While there are clear advantages to clean energy – lower costs, greater employment,  reduced local pollution, and ultimately greater financial returns – the transition will not  be painless. Energy workers’ skills and locations may not be well matched to the new  energy economy. Whole communities still depend on fossil fuel industries. There is a  vital need for a careful, just transition to maximize the benefits of climate action while  minimizing its negative impacts.  Governments should provide training and social protection for affected energy workers  and communities. Where appropriate, they should require energy companies to offer  viable careers to their workers in non-carbon areas of their business. Governments  should also consult with communities to kick-start investments that will enable carbondependent  regions to find a new economic life. Waiting is not an option; planning and  implementation must begin now:  Y Governments and companies should conduct a proactively managed decline of the  fossil fuel industry and ensure a just transition for the workers and communities that  depend on it.

Extreme weather events, rising oceans,  and record setting temperatures are  already wreaking havoc on hundreds of  millions of lives and livelihoods around the  world. In the absence of strong action to  reduce emissions, these impacts will get  significantly worse throughout the course  of the twenty-first Century: 1  Y A large proportion of the earth’s species  faces increased risk of extinction, as  many cannot adapt or migrate as fast  as the climate changes. Lost species will  never return.  Y Crop yields will be severely reduced,  potentially causing hunger on a mass  scale. The Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) reports a one-in-five chance (in terms of proportion of  model projections) that yields of wheat,  corn, rice and soy will decrease by more  than 50% by 2100, and a further one-in-five  chance that they will decrease by  between 25% and 50%: in either case the  consequences would be catastrophic.  Y Water supplies too will become stressed,  especially in dry and tropical regions.  Y Cities will increasingly be hit by storms  and extreme precipitation, inland and  coastal flooding, landslides, air pollution,  drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and  storm surges.  This report sets out the decisions and  actions that can be taken now to avoid  the worst of these impacts on lives and  livelihoods, on economies and ecosystems.  WELL BELOW 2°C, AND  AIMING FOR 1.5°C  During the first decade of the twenty-first  century, 2°C of warming above pre-industrial  levels was often seen as a “guardrail” of a  safe climate. Since then, new findings have  indicated that view to be too optimistic.  Runaway climate change – in which feedback  loops drive ever-worsening climate change,  regardless of human activities – are now  seen as a risk even at 2°C of warming.2  A two-year review within the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC), based on inputs from scientists  and other experts, summarized the evolving  understanding: “The ‘guardrail’ concept, in  which up to 2°C of warming is considered  safe, is inadequate and would therefore be  better seen as an upper limit, a defense line  that needs to be stringently defended, while  less warming would be preferable.”3  There has been limited study of specific  climate impacts at 1.5°C, but some initial  findings suggest significantly lower  risks than at 2°C. Bruce Campbell of  the Consultative Group for International  Agricultural Research (CGIAR) estimates  that 2°C of warming could reduce African  maize yields by 50% compared to 1.5°C  of warming,4 while a recent assessment  by Carl-Friedrich Schleussner and others  identified several differential impacts  between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming:5  Y Heat extremes would become both more  frequent and of longer duration at 2°C  than at 1.5°C.  Y Reductions in water availability for the  Mediterranean region would nearly double  from 9% to 17% between 1.5°C and 2°C,  and the projected lengthening of regional  dry spells would increase from 7% to 11%.  Y Wheat yields would be reduced by 15%  at 2°C compared to 9% at 1.5°C in a best  estimate; the reduction could be as bad  as 42% at 2°C versus 25% at 1.5°C.  Y The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C  is likely to be decisive for the survival of  tropical coral reefs.  For these reasons – and due to the moral call  from small island states and other vulnerable  nations – governments meeting in Paris  set more ambitious goals than at previous  UNFCCC meetings. The Paris Agreement  established the goal of “holding the increase  in global average temperature to well below  2°C above preindustrial levels and pursuing  efforts to limit the temperature increase to  1.5°C above preindustrial levels.”6  Still, the specific commitments that  governments made in Paris were not  sufficient to deliver these long-term goals.  The Climate Action Tracker estimates that  current global commitments (as stated in  countries’ Intended Nationally Determined  Contributions to the UNFCCC) would  result in 2.7°C of warming by the end of the  century.7 In this report we explore what is  necessary to actually meet the Paris goals.  1. CLIMATE SCIENCE  AND CARBON  BUDGETS  e Examples include release of methane due to melting permafrost or accelerated dieback of Amazon rainforest.    Box 1: Carbon Budgets and Other Greenhouse Gases  The carbon budgets concept applies to CO2, because of the  way it accumulates in the atmosphere over many decades. The  budgets concept cannot be used in the same way to account for  other greenhouse gases, which have a more complex warming  effect because they do not last for as long in the atmosphere.  Methane is the most important of these other gases.  In the short term, methane is a much more potent greenhouse  gas than CO2. However, because methane molecules break down  after an average of twelve years, their direct warming effect  occurs only during those years after they are emitted, while they  are still present in the atmosphere. Methane also has indirect  effects lasting beyond twelve years, due to feedback loops in  the climate system.g Because these loops do not follow a linear  relationship with cumulative emissions, they cannot be described  using carbon budgets.  For these reasons, carbon budgets as discussed in this report  relate only to CO2. However, other greenhouse gases are factored  in when the sizes of CO2 budgets are calculated. Assumptions are  made about what other gases’ future emissions will be, and so  if those assumptions change, then the sizes of carbon budgets  change. Recent studies have indicated that methane leakage  rates from natural gas facilities in the United States are much  higher than previously thought, especially as a result of hydraulic  fracturing, or “fracking.”16 Such changed assumptions may  require CO2 budgets to be revised downward, which would allow  for less CO2 to be emitted.  CARBON BUDGETS  Many existing analyses of the energy  transition start from the current energy  system, and attempt to plot what they  consider pragmatic rates of change from the  status quo. In some cases, such an approach  fails to deliver the emissions reductions  needed. In that vein, oil companies have  often used their energy forecasts to claim  that preventing dangerous climate change is  simply impossible:  Y BP: “Emissions [will] remain well above  the path recommended by scientists.” 8  Y Shell: “We also do not see governments  taking the steps now that are consistent  with the 2°C scenario.”9  Y ExxonMobil: “It is difficult to envision  governments choosing this [low carbon]  path.”In this report we take the opposite  approach: we start from climate limits  and translate into what needs to happen  to the energy system in order to achieve  them. We find that what is necessary is also  achievable.  We know from atmospheric physics that  the key factor determining the extent of  global warming is the cumulative amount  of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over  time.11 Because CO2 stays in the atmosphere  for centuries, it has been accumulating for  many decades and continues to do so.12 To  keep warming within any particular limit –  all else being equal – there is a maximum  cumulative amount of CO2 that may be  emitted. (Non-CO2 greenhouse gases are  treated differently – see Box 1)  In the same way that an individual, business,  or government has a budget corresponding  to the resources they have, how long they  need them to last, and the consequences of  debt or deficit, a carbon budget does the  same for greenhouse gas pollution. This is  an important and helpful way to understand  what we can afford to burn when it  comes to fossil fuels (and other sources of  emissions), and to drive conversations about  the most effective and fairest ways to divide  the budget between regions and types of  fossil fuels.  In this report we analyze the carbon  budgets calculated by the IPCC, to examine  their implications for the energy system. We  consider two climate limits: a likely chance  (66%) of limiting global warming to below  2°C, and a medium chance (50%) of limiting  it to below 1.5°C. These budgets are shown  in Table 1, deducting emissions that have  occurred since the IPCC compiled them.  Some scenarios and analyses, such as the  International Energy Agency’s 450 Scenario,  are based on a 50% chance of staying below  2°C of warming.13 Since 2°C is considered an  absolute limit beyond which severe dangers  occur, these 50% odds may be considered  imprudent; hence other analyses such as  United Nations Environment Programme’s  annual Emissions Gap report use the  budget for delivering a 66% chance of  avoiding those dangers, as do we in this  report.f However, we use a 50% chance of  reaching 1.5°C because it has been set as  an aspirational goal in the Paris Agreement,  rather than an absolute maximum.    Table 1: Global Carbon Budgets for Likely Chance of 2°C and Medium Chance of 1.5°C  f There is an argument on that basis that we should require a better than 66% of staying below 2°C – a 33% chance of failure is frightening, given the severity of what failure actually  means. The IPCC provides budgets only for 33%, 50%, and 66%, partly as a relic of earlier decisions on how to quantify English-language terms such as “likely” and “unlikely.”  While some scientists have calculated carbon budgets that would give 80% or 90% probabilities, in this report we use the IPCC budgets, as they are the most-reviewed and most authoritative  options. However, we do so with the following proviso: to be more confident of staying below 2°C, budgets would be smaller and require more dramatic action than  outlined here.  g For example, short-term warming caused by methane’s direct greenhouse effect may cause ice to melt, reducing the extent to which solar radiation is reflected, and hence leading  to greater absorption of heat, even beyond the methane’s atmospheric lifetime.    URGENT EMISSIONS CUTS  To put the carbon budget numbers in  context, we can compare them with current  rates of emissions.  We see from Table 2 that reducing  emissions is urgent: at current rates of  emissions, the carbon budget for a likely  chance of limiting warming to 2°C will be  fully exhausted by 2037, and by 2025 for a  medium chance at 1.5°C.  For the world to stay within either of these  temperature limits, rapid emissions cuts  are required. Figure 1 shows a range of  scenarios for emissions pathways that  would lead to achieving the likely chance of  2°C or medium chance of 1.5°C outcomes.  For 2°C, emissions need to reach net zero  by around 2070, and for 1.5°C they must do  so by 2050 – and in both cases they must  fall steeply, starting immediately.  Note that these scenarios assume that  “negative emissions” technology will occur  in the second half of the century, through  approaches such as bioenergy with carbon  capture and storage or direct air capture. If  we want to avoid depending on unproven  technology becoming available, emissions  would need to be reduced even more  rapidly.    CLIMATE SCIENCE AND CARBON BUDGETS BOX 2: A History of Carbon Budget Analyses  This report continues a tradition of work by scientists and  campaigners showing how global carbon budgets limit the  amount of fossil fuels that can safely be extracted and burned.  It has been known for more than 20 years that cumulative  emissions of CO2 are a key determinant of how much the planet  warms. The IPCC’s Second Assessment Report in 1995 observed  that in climate models all pathways leading to a particular  temperature outcome had similar cumulative emissions.Indeed, the notion of carbon budgets goes back at least to  the early 1990s.20 Further scientific study has developed our  understanding of how this works in relation to the carbon cycle,  forming a major theme in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report in  2013-14.  The pioneering step was taken by Bill Hare, then Climate Policy  Director of Greenpeace, in what he called the 'carbon logic'.  His 1997 paper, “Fossil Fuels and Climate Protection” showed  that if burned, the fossil fuel reserves that were known at that  time would release at least four times as much CO2 as could be  afforded while keeping warming below 1°C, or twice as much  as the budget to keep below 2°C.21 Several campaign groups  (including Greenpeace, Oilwatch, Rainforest Action Network,  Project Underground, and Amazon Watch) used the analysis to  argue that exploration for new reserves should be stopped, but it  was many more years before such calls started to gain traction.  In 2009, an influential paper was published in the journal Nature  by Malte Meinshausen and seven co-authors (including Hare,  who by then worked with Meinshausen at the Potsdam Institute  for Climate Impact Research). They found that only 43% of the  world’s fossil fuels could be burned before 2050 if the world was  to have a 50% chance of keeping warming below 2°C, or 27% of  reserves for a 75% chance.Based on Meinshausen’s research, in 2011 the Carbon Tracker  Initiative published a report coining the term 'unburnable carbon'  and describing its potential consequences for financial markets.Carbon Tracker continues to examine the implications of  stranded assets, which are long-term fossil fuel investments that  will fail to generate returns because they were made assuming  the world will not sufficiently act to address climate change.  Bill McKibben brought this analysis to a wider audience in 2012 in  an article in Rolling Stone entitled “Global Warming’s Terrifying  New Math.” In it, he argued that three simple numbers – the 2°C  limit, the 565 Gt CO2 budget for an 80% chance of staying within  the limit, and the 2,795 Gt CO2 of fossil fuel reserves – added up  to global catastrophe.24 The following year, Mike Berners-Lee and  Duncan Clark published an analysis of reserves versus carbon  budgets in a book, ""The Burning Question"".  In 2015, Christophe McGlade and Paul Ekins assessed which  reserves might be left unburned if emissions were constrained  within carbon budgets through an escalating carbon price.  Their paper in Nature concluded that 88% of global coal reserves  should remain unburned for a 50% chance of staying below  2°C. Even after assuming significant development of CCS, this  proportion dropped to just 82% of global coal reserves. 75%  of Canada’s tar sands would have to remain unburned, or 74%  with CCS.This report is inspired by that history of earlier work, and aims  to build on it by turning the focus to reserves in fields and mines  that are already operating.    FOSSIL FUEL RESERVES  After a company finds and then develops a  deposit of oil, gas, or coal, it will generally  extract the deposit over a period of several  decades (see Figure 4 on page 20). Reserves  are the quantity of known oil, gas, or coal  that can be extracted in the coming years,  with current technology and in current  economic conditions.h  In Figure 2 we compare carbon budgets  with fossil fuel reserves, echoing earlier work  to translate climate limits into energy limits  (see Box 2). For oil and gas, both proven  and probable reserves are shown, while for  coal only proven reserves are shown (see  Appendix 1).i  We see that for a likely chance of keeping  warming below 2°C, 68% of reserves must  remain in the ground. For a medium chance  of limiting warming to 1.5°C, 85% of reserves  must remain underground.  This conclusion is based on an assumption  that carbon capture and storage (CCS)  is not widely deployed. CCS is a process  in which some of the CO2 released from  burning fossil fuels is captured, compressed,  and stored underground in deep geological  reservoirs – thus enabling fossil fuels to be  burned without releasing all of their carbon  into the atmosphere. The problem is that  the technology needed is far from proven:  it has been deployed only in a few pilot  settings, and without significant success (see  Appendix 3); meanwhile, there are reasons to  believe its costs may remain prohibitive, and  questions about its environmental safety.  If CCS is eventually proven and deployed, it  might provide a welcome means of further  lowering emissions. However, we take the  view that it would not be prudent to be  dependent on an uncertain technology to  avoid dangerous climate change; a much  safer approach is to ensure that emissions  are reduced in the first place by reducing  fossil fuel use and moving the economy  to clean energy. Therefore, we apply that  assumption throughout this report.j  Figure 2: Global Fossil Fuel Reserves Compared to Carbon Budgets for Likely Chance of 2°C and Medium Chance of 1.5°Ch Reserves are a subset of resources, which are an estimate of all the oil, gas, or coal that might one day be extracted. There are two criteria that define reserves:  (i) They have been identified – they have a specified location and grade/type (whereas resources also include those that are expected or postulated to exist, based on geological  understanding)  (ii) They can be extracted with currently available technology and under current economic conditions (whereas resources also include those that rely on speculative future technologies  or commodity prices)i An overview of government-reported data for nine countries that together account for 60% of proven coal reserves suggests additional probable reserves of around 350 Gt of coal  in those countries, equivalent to 885 Gt of CO2. However, coal data is plagued by unreliability and inconsistent definitions, so this estimate should be taken with caution.j As noted, we are taking a different approach from the IEA’s 450 Scenario, which assumes large-scale CCS will become available, hence requiring only modest reductions in fossil  fuel usage while having a 50% chance of staying within 2°C.    CLIMATE SCIENCE AND CARBON BUDGETS Excavators pile up coal on a quay at the Port of Lianyungang in  Lianyungang city, east China’s Jiangsu province, 10 November 2013.  © Associated Press, Wang Chun.  We have seen that existing fossil fuel  reserves considerably exceed both the  2°C and 1.5°C carbon budgets. It follows  that exploration for new fossil fuel reserves  is at best a waste of money and at worst  very dangerous. However, ceasing  exploration is not enough, as that still  leaves much more fossil fuel than can  safely be burned.  DEVELOPED RESERVES  We now turn to the question of how much  room exists within the carbon budgets for  development of new oil fields, gas fields,  and coal mines.  Figure 3 explains three categories of fossil  fuels in the ground:  Y Resources that might one day be  extracted, some of which are  geologically “expected” but yet to  be actually found.  Y Reserves that are known and extractable  using today’s technologies and in today’s  economic conditions.  Y Developed Reserves that can currently  be extracted from oil fields, gas  fields and coal mines that are already  operating – for which the wells have  been drilled and the pits dug, and where  the pipelines, processing facilities,  railways, and export terminals have been  constructed.  We focus on the smallest of these three  measures: ‘developed reserves’. If no new  fields or mines are developed, production  of each fossil fuel will decline over time  as existing fields and mines are depleted,  eventually reaching zero. A finite amount  of cumulative production would thus occur  with no new development, which we have  estimated in Table 3.  2. ENOUGH OIL, GAS,  AND COAL ALREADY  IN PRODUCTION    What exists, ultimately recoverable  (incl. with future technology).  What is known, economically recoverable now.  What is known and recoverable in  currently operating fields and mines.  drill wells, dig mines,  build infrastructure  explore, develop technology    18 ENOUGH OIL, GAS AND COAL ALREADY IN PRODUCTION  For oil and gas fields, we use data from  Rystad Energy’s UCube, a database of  upstream oil and gas projects.29 Rystad  creates this data using a combination  of company reports, regulatory information,  and modeling. We have included fields  that are currently being developed – for  which shovels are in the ground – as well  as those already producing, as the under-construction  ones are “committed” in a  similar sense. Because the estimates of  reserves in existing fields are sensitive  to oil and gas prices, we have used  Rystad’s base case, which projects the  prices Rystad considers most likely  over coming years.  Rystad provides data at the level of an  “asset”, which roughly divides the oil and  gas universe into units for which a separate  investment decision is made, based on its  assessed profitability. For this reason, we  do not count the reserves that would be  unlocked in future development phases  of a producing field as “developed.” For  example, we count the 3.6 billion barrels  of oil that can be extracted with existing  infrastructure on BP’s Mad Dog field in the  Gulf of Mexico as developed, but not the  further 10.7 billion barrels that would be  unlocked by its planned Mad Dog Phase  2 development, which would involve  additional infrastructure investments.  For coal mines, we use estimates from the  International Energy Agency (IEA), which  are comprised of data from various sources  combined with the IEA’s own analysis.It should be noted that available data for  coal is generally of poorer quality than for  oil and gas (see Appendix 1). Data is not  available for coal mines under construction.  Table 3: Developed Reserves and CO2 Emissions, from Existing and Under-Construction Global Oil and Gas Fields, and Existing Coal MinesReserves Emissions    Figure 5 compares developed reserves  with the carbon budgets. In addition to  emissions from energy (the burning of the  three fossil fuels), we must also consider  two other sources of emissions:  Y Land use, especially changes in forest  cover and agricultural uses;  Y Cement manufacture, where aside from  any energy usage, CO2 is released in the  calcination reaction that is fundamental  to cement production.k  In both cases, we use relatively optimistic  projections of emissions this century,  assuming climate action, while noting that  these sit within a wide range of projections,  from those assuming business-as-usual  to those involving speculative new  technologies. This range is shown in  Table 4 (more details in Appendix 2). There  is considerable variation in modelled land  use emissions.l If emissions from these two  sources are not reduced to zero by the end  of this century, they could occupy a larger  share of the remaining carbon budgets,  leaving less for fossil fuel emissions.  It can be seen from Figure 5 that (in the  absence of CCS):  Y The emissions from existing fossil fuel  fields and mines exceed the 2°C carbon  budget.  A recent study by Alex Pfeiffer and  colleagues at Oxford University found that  the “2°C capital stock” of power plants  will be reached in 2017, by projecting the  emissions from power plants over their full  40-year lifespans. In other words, if any  more gas or coal plants are built after next  year, others will have to be retired before  the end of their design lives, in order for  the world to have a 50% chance of staying  below the 2°C limit (for a 66% chance of  2°C, that capital stock was reached in 2009,  meaning early retirements are already  required).32 We have reached a similar  conclusion for the capital stock in fossil  fuel extraction.  NO MORE FOSSIL FUELS  In 2015, President of Kiribati Anote Tong  wrote to other national leaders urging an  end to the development of new coal mines,  “as an essential initial step in our collective  global action against climate change”.As a low-lying island in the Pacific, Kiribati is  a nation whose very existence is threatened.  Our analysis in this report supports his call,  and extends it further.  If we are to stay within the agreed climate  limits and avoid the dangers that more  severe warming would cause, the fossil fuels  in fields that have already been developed  exceed our global carbon budget.  Therefore, we conclude that:  Y No new oil fields, gas fields, or coal mines  should be developed anywhere in the  world, beyond those that are already in  use or under construction.m  Y Similarly, no new transportation  infrastructure – such as pipelines, export  terminals, and rail facilities – should be  built to facilitate new field and mine  development (this does not preclude  replacing existing infrastructure such as  an old, leaky pipeline).Governments and companies might argue  that early closure of coal could make space  for new development of oil and gas. This  substitution argument might have worked  if the total developed reserves were  equivalent to well below 2°C or 1.5°C. But  instead, Figure 5 shows that developed  reserves exceed the 2°C carbon budget  and significantly exceed the 1.5°C budget.  Furthermore:  Y Oil and gas emissions alone exceed the  1.5°C budget.  If governments are serious about keeping  warming well below 2°C and aiming for  1.5°C, no new oil or gas development would  be permitted, even if coal, cement, and  deforestation were stopped overnight.  LEAST-COST APPROACHES  Many analyses of emissions pathways and  climate solutions assess the “least-cost”  routes to achieving climate targets.n Such  an analysis – with the same targets we  have used in this report – might not lead to  the conclusion that no new fields or mines  should be developed. Although developed  reserves will often be cheaper to extract  than new reserves because capital has  already been spent, that is not always  the case. A new Saudi oil field may cost  less to develop and operate than simply  maintaining production from an existing  Venezuelan heavy oil field, for example.  In optimizing the global economics, a least-cost  approach might suggest that rather  than precluding new development, we  should instead close the Venezuelan field  early and open the Saudi one. In this report  we take a different approach.  There are two rationales for using least-cost  models to assess the best way of achieving  a given climate target: predictively,  assuming a markets-based mechanism  for delivering change; or normatively, on  grounds that the least total cost implies the  greatest net benefit to humanity.  As it relates to this report, the predictive role  will hold only if we expect that sufficiently  strict market-based policies will be put  in place to achieve climate goals. In the  absence of these policies, the predictive role  is lost. Those policies do not currently exist;  and in fact, in Section 4 we will argue that  market-based, demand-side policies alone  may not be enough to transform the energy  system to the extent climate limits require.  k Calcium carbonate (limestone) is heated to break it into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide, the largest ingredient used to make cement clinker: CaCO3 → CaO + CO2. The heat may  come from coal or gas, but those emissions are counted within the energy total: the additional component here is the CO2 from the calcination reaction.  l Many scenarios include significant negative emissions, from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), biochar, and afforestation. In this report, we have based our conclusions on an assumption  that CCS is not deployed at scale, based on unpromising experience to date (see Appendix 3). Extending this precautionary assumption could potentially increase the assumed land  use emissions, and reduce the share of carbon budgets available for fossil fuels.  m It should be noted that we have not included probable reserves of coal, due to lack of data and for the other reasons listed in Appendix 1. So more precisely, our conclusion is that  coal mines should not continue producing beyond their proven reserves. Similarly, if new technology enabled greater recovery from existing oil and gas fields, further restraint would  be needed.  n They commonly do so using an integrated assessment model, which combines both physical effects of emissions in the climate system, and economic effects of energy in the  economy. Such models are used to generate the emissions scenarios featured in IPCC reports, such as those shown in Figure 1.  20 ENOUGH OIL, GAS AND COAL ALREADY IN PRODUCTION  Table 4: Assumed 2015 to 2100 Emissions from Land Use and Non-Energy Emissions from Cement Manufacture (see Appendix 2 for details)  Gt CO2 Assumed Base Case Range  Land Use 21 -206 to Cement Manufacture 162 150 to 2  Figure 5: Emissions from Developed Reserves, Compared to Carbon Budgets for Likely Chance of 2°C and Medium Chance of 1.5°C  Sources: Rystad Energy, IEA, World Energy Council, IPCC  ENOUGH OIL, GAS AND COAL ALREADY IN PRODUCTION Examining the normative rationale, we run  into the important question of how the  climate goal is to be achieved. It is a sad  reflection on climate politics that leaders  find it easy to make principled or pragmatic  arguments for why others should take  action, but much harder to see arguments  for why they should do so themselves. No  government seems to need much excuse to  carry on extracting or burning fossil fuels:  the logic leaps quickly from “someone can  extract if conditions ABC are met” to “I can  extract as much as I like.” This is one reason  why we focus on overall global limits.  Since political action is required, we  should look for solutions that are not just  economically optimized, but politically  optimized. Politically, it is much more  difficult to demand the loss of physical  capital – on which dollars have been spent,  and steel and concrete installed – than to  relinquish the future hope of benefits from  untapped reserves. Shutting an existing  asset leads to an investor losing money,  and if a government shuts it by decree the  investor will demand compensation. That  lost money is a powerful disincentive for  all parties involved. In contrast, stopping  plans for the construction of unbuilt  facilities mostly involves the loss of potential  future income, since the amount spent on  exploration is relatively small.  Similarly, existing jobs held by specific  people generally carry more political weight  than the promise of future jobs. This can  even be the case when policy decisions may  lead to more jobs than the present ones that  would be lost. We will examine this in more  detail in Section 4 and 5.

THE FRONT LINES OF  EXPANSION  The consequence of our analysis is that no  new extractive or facilitating infrastructure  should be built anywhere in the world. We  identify here the countries where the most  expansion is proposed. If these expansions  go ahead, they could be the worst culprits  in tipping the world over the edge.  (i) Coal  The world’s largest and fifth-largest coal  producers, China and Indonesia, have  declared moratoria on new coal mine  development. The second-largest producer,  the United States, has implemented a  limited moratorium on new coal mines on  public lands. These three countries account  for roughly two-thirds of the world’s coal  production (or 60%, if US production  on non-federal lands is excluded).The first priority must be to make these  moratoria permanent, and to extend the  U.S. moratorium to all coal mining in the  country.  The two countries that are currently  proceeding with major coal mining  development are Australia and India:  Y Australia: Nine coal mines are proposed  in the Galilee Basin in Queensland. They  would have combined peak production  of 330 Mt of coal per year, amounting to  705 Mt CO2 of emissions per year – if this  were a country, it would be the world’s  7th largest emitter.36 Table 5 shows the  six mines that have filed applications  for regulatory approval, with estimated  recovery of 9.6 billion metric tons of  coal over their lifetimes, leading to  24 Gt of CO2 emissions. This would total  6% of the global carbon budget for 1.5°C.  Three further mines – Watarah’s Alpha  North, GVK/Hancock’s Alpha West, and  Vale’s Degulla – have not yet started the  approvals process.  Y India: In 2015, the government of  India set a target of tripling national  coal extraction to 1.5 billion metric tons  per year by 2020, with majority-stateo-wned  Coal India Limited increasing its  extraction to 1 billion metric tons per  year, and other companies increasing  from 120 Mt per year to 500 Mt per  year.38 Most commentators expect  production growth to fall well short  of these goals; the IEA’s projection  of production from existing and new  mines is shown in Figure 6. Data  are not available on the reserves in  new mines.  It should be noted that India has done less  than most countries to cause the climate  problem: despite having 18% of the world’s  population, it has accounted for just 3%  of historical global CO2 emissions.40 And  with per capita GDP of just $1,600, the  country has an urgent need for economic  development. Therefore, many argue with  good justification that it is unreasonable to  expect a country like India to bear an equal  burden of addressing climate change to  those with far greater historic responsibility.  At the same time, it is difficult to see how  the world can avoid dangerous climate  change if this coal expansion goes ahead.  The solution could be a generous support  package, primarily provided by the wealthy  countries that are most responsible for  climate change, including climate finance  and technology transfer, to help India    Mtce Existing mines Brown and Greenfield Projects  Figure 6: Projected Indian Coal Production from Existing and  Proposed Mines, in Million Metric Tons of Coal Equivalent  (taking into account low quality)  Figure 7: CO2 Emissions from Largest Proposed New Oil and Gas Developments  Source: Rystad Energy  (ii) Oil and Gas  The largest proposed oil and gas  developments, as projected by Rystad,  are shown in Figure 7.  They comprise:  Y Qatar: Along with partner ExxonMobil,  state-owned Qatar Petroleum plans  to expand gas and oil production on  the massive North field in several new  phases, although this is not expected  until prices increase. The projected 52 Gt  of lifetime CO2 emissions would on their  own exhaust 13% of the 1.5°C budget.  Y United States: Major ongoing fracking  developments, particularly for oil in  North Dakota’s Bakken, and Texas’  Permian and Eagle Ford shales, and  for gas in the Appalachian Basin’s  Marcellus-Utica shale. These are all  proceeding in spite of low prices,  and would add another 51 Gt of  CO2 emissions.  Y Russia: Gazprom proposes several major  gas and oil developments in the Yamal  Peninsula in Arctic northwest Siberia,  though this is not expected until prices  increase. They would add 38 Gt of CO2  emissions.  Y Iran: The Iranian government is currently  preparing an auction of several fields and  exploration blocks to foreign companies,  with initial offerings expected in late  2016 or early 2017. The emissions would  amount to 24 Gt CO2.  Y Canada: Proposed expansion of tar  sands extraction in Alberta depends  on the construction of new pipelines,  which have been stalled due to public  opposition. Two major new pipelines  are currently proposed, one by Kinder  Morgan to the west coast and another  by TransCanada to the east coast.  Projected emissions are 21 Gt CO2.  It can be seen from the chart that new  gas development is as much of a threat  as new oil development.  Proceeding with any of the above oil, gas,  or coal expansions – the world’s largest  new sources of new carbon proposed for  development – could commit us to far more  than 2°C warming.  ENOUGH OIL, GAS AND COAL ALREADY IN PRODUCTION 3. TRIMMING THE  EXCESS  We saw in the previous section that  stopping new fossil fuel construction can  get the world closer to staying below 2°C of  warming, but still is not enough (see Figure  5). Some closure of existing operations will  be required to limit warming to 2°C. To have  a chance of staying below 1.5°C, significant  closures will be needed.  We have noted that closing existing  facilities is more politically difficult than  not building new ones. Stopping new fossil  fuel construction minimizes the number of  existing operations that need to be closed  early. In this section we will consider where  the necessary early shut-downs could or  should take place.  Environmental justice is a priority principle  for considering where to stop fossil fuel  extraction. Extraction should not continue  where it violates the rights of local people  – including indigenous peoples – nor  should it continue where resulting pollution  would cause intolerable health impacts or  seriously damage biodiversity. Fossil fuels  have a long and violent history of being  associated with such violations, stopping  which is important in its own right.  COAL MINES  An obvious candidate for early closure  is the coal sector. Coal accounts for the  largest share of resources, the largest  CO2 emissions intensity, and the largest  emissions per unit of power generated.  Furthermore, coal’s use in power generation  is readily substitutable by renewable  energy,o at least in countries and regions  with mature electrical grids. Coal mining  is also less capital-intensive than oil or gas  extraction, so it is less costly to retire  a coal asset early (although coal mining  is also more labor-intensive, raising issues  of its closure’s impact on workers – see  Section 5).  This does not mean that all coal should be  phased out before any action to restrict  existing oil and gas extraction. Poorer  countries rely disproportionately on coal  for their energy, compared to oil and gas:  coal accounts for 19% of primary energy in  industrialized countries in the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD), but 37% of primary  energy in non-OECD countries.42 There is  danger that placing too much emphasis on  coal may put an unfair share of the burden  on the very countries who did least to cause  the climate problem and who have the least  financial and technological capacity to  transform their economies. We will examine  these issues in more detail shortly.  As a starting point, there is little justification  for continued mining or burning of thermal  coal in industrialized countries. Figure 8  shows that the OECD countries extracting  the most coal are the United States,  Australia, Germany, and Poland.  China has already adopted a policy of  closing some existing coal mines, which  will cut its annual production capacity by  between one to two billion metric tons  of coal, depending on implementation.  For comparison, China currently extracts  3.7 billion metric tons, (though these  capacity reductions will not translate to  a 25% to 50% cut in output because of  current overcapacity, but they will reduce  China’s developed reserves.)o Around 17% of coal demand is used in steel production. Research and development is under way to seek to make steel without coal; some projects have instead used forestryderived  charcoal, and earlier-stage technologies include polymers or natural gas. Steel is also highly recyclable, boosting recycling levels from the current 30% could help reduce the  level of demand.  Hard coal Lignite  Figure 8: Partying Like it’s 1899:44 OECD Countries (a) Extracting and (b) Burning the Most Coal (2014 data)  a. Extraction b. Consumption  Source: German Federal Institute for Geosciences & Natural Resources (BGR)  The Shengli open-cast coal mine in Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China, 2012.    Some poorer countries see extraction and  use of fossil fuels as a means to achieve  economic empowerment, by providing  either domestic energy or revenue from  exports. At the same time, the greatest  impacts of climate change will fall on poorer  countries which have done the least to cause  the climate problem. A study commissioned  by the Climate Vulnerable Forum estimates  that climate change already causes 400,000  deaths per year, 98% of which occur in  developing countries as a result of increases  in hunger and in communicable diseases.  The current estimated 1.7% reduction in  global gross domestic product (GDP) due  to climate change is disproportionately felt  by the world’s poorest nations, the Least  Developed Countries, whose GDP is being  reduced by 7%.In contrast to the least-cost approaches  discussed in the previous section, the  appropriate question is not only which  solution incurs the least cost to humanity  as a whole: we must also consider a just  distribution of who incurs the cost, such  that each country contributes its fair share  to address the global problem of climate  change.  We have argued that ending the  construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure  is a politically pragmatic approach to  avoiding dangerous climate change. The  problem is that much of current fossil fuel  extraction is located where it may not be  most needed or justified in terms of fairness;  examples include oil, gas, and coal in the  United States and Russia, oil in Canada, oil  in Saudi Arabia, and coal in Australia.  A forthcoming paper by Sivan Kartha and  colleagues at the Stockholm Environment  Institute argues that climate politics contain  an unresolved tension between two  different views of fossil fuel extraction: one  of “extraction as pollution,” and another of  “extraction as [economic] development.”The authors point out that this tension  goes right back to the 1992 UNFCCC  treaty, whose preamble says: “States  have […] the sovereign right to exploit  their own resources pursuant to their own  environmental and developmental policies,  and the responsibility to ensure that  activities within their jurisdiction or control  do not cause damage to the environment of  other States or of areas beyond the limits of  national jurisdiction.”  At the level of emissions, where most  climate policy has historically focused,  this tension has been addressed through  the principles of equity. Most importantly,  the duty to cut emissions rests more with  countries that carry greater responsibility  for causing the problem (those with greater  historic emissions), and with those that  have most capacity to act (the wealthiest  countries).47 Industrialized countries,  which account for just 18% of the world’s  population, are responsible for 60% of all  historical CO2 emissions.Already, important questions arise. How  do these principles of responsibility and  capacity translate to the fossil fuel supply  side? How does the “resource curse” – the  paradox that those countries with the  most natural resources sometimes have  less economic development success –  diminish the developmental value of fossil  fuels, or the historic responsibility for their  extraction? How do demand-side equity  and supply-side equity interrelate?  Oil Change International is working with  the Stockholm Environment Institute on  a paper that more fully explores these  questions and makes concrete proposals  for an equity framework on fossil fuel  Syncrude upgrader plant north of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada  supply. For now, it is clear that whatever  the details, the onus of climate action  remains on wealthier countries both to take  action themselves, and to help finance and  facilitate further action in countries that do  not have the resources to do so themselves.  Countries with low levels of fossil fuel  infrastructure have an opportunity to seek  sustainable development along a low-carbon  pathway, leapfrogging to clean energy  without the risk and cost of investing in assets  that may become stranded when climate  action makes them obsolete. In this regard,  it should be noted that some of the greatest  ambition for energy transition comes from  small, poor, and vulnerable countries, such as  Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Djibouti, and Vanuatu  (see Box 3 in Section 5).  However, in return such countries can and  should rightly demand financial support  from industrialized countries, given the  advantages these nations have drawn from  fossil fuels, and conversely the challenges  for poorer countries of integrating variable  renewables in weaker grids. This may include  investment and transfer of technologies  in renewable energy, as well as in other  industries that can provide alternatives to  revenue from fossil fuel extraction.  Other developing countries that have relied  more on fossil fuel extraction or combustion  will similarly require finance to facilitate a  transition, in a manner that protects the  livelihoods of those working in the energy  industry and diversifies their revenue bases  and broader economies. Some fossil fuel  exporters have grappled with the challenge  of how to lift their people out of poverty  while addressing climate change. Ecuador,  for instance, has proposed charging a  tax on oil exports to wealthy countries, to  increase revenue while also incentivizing  lower oil use.  We conclude:  Y To achieve the Paris goals, no new fossil  fuel extraction infrastructure should be  built in any country, rich or poor, except  in extreme cases where there is clearly  no other viable option for providing  energy access.  Y Since rich countries have a greater  responsibility to act, they should provide  finance to poorer countries to help  expand non-carbon energy and drive  economic development, as part of their  fair share of global action. Particularly  important will be financial support to  meet the urgent priority of providing  universal access to energy. Around  the world, over a billion people have  no electricity in their home. Nearly  three billion rely on wood or other  biomass for cooking or heating. Lack  of access to energy in households and  communities threatens the achievement  of nearly every one of the Sustainable  Development Goals that the international  community has set to fight poverty,  hunger, and disease.  Y To stay within our carbon budgets, we  must go further than stopping new  construction: some fossil fuel extraction  assets must be closed before they are  exploited fully. These early shut-downs  should occur predominantly in rich  countries.  Y Extraction should not continue where  it violates the rights of local people  – including indigenous peoples – nor  should it continue where resulting  pollution would cause intolerable  health impacts or seriously damage  biodiversity.    Over the last three decades, climate policy  has focused almost exclusively on limiting  the combustion rather than the extraction  of fossil fuels. While there is a certain  intuitive sense to that, because it is  combustion that physically releases CO2  into the atmosphere, this is far from  the only way to address the problem.  By contrast, ozone protection was  achieved by regulating the production  of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other  chemicals, rather than trying to influence  their usage and release (for example by  a deodorant tax or quota).  Around 95% of the carbon extracted in oil,  gas, or coal is subsequently burned and  released into the atmosphere as CO2.  As such, the amount of carbon extracted  is roughly equal to the amount that will  be emitted.  There are two routes by which extracted  carbon may not end up in the atmosphere:  Y Small amounts of oil and gas are used  in industrial manufacturing of plastics,  chemicals, fertilizer, and other products.  In 2011, non-combustion uses accounted  for 14% of U.S. oil consumption, 2%  of gas consumption, and 0.1% of coal  consumption – combined, these total  just 6% of the carbon in U.S. fossil fuel  consumption.49 Even in some of these  cases, the carbon still ends up in the  atmosphere as the finished products  decompose.  Y In theory, CO2 emissions could be  captured. However, CCS has barely  been deployed to date, despite  strong advocacy since the 1990s by  the fossil fuel industry. Due to slow  development of the technology, even  if CCS were developed at scale – and  it is questionable whether it could be  at affordable cost – the carbon budget  would only be extended by an estimated  12-14% by 2050 (see Appendix 3).Apart from these exceptions – one of them  minor, and the other currently tiny with  uncertain prospects – any carbon that  is extracted in fossil fuels ends up in the  atmosphere as CO2, as shown in Figure 9.  THREE POSSIBLE FUTURES  We have seen that the reserves in  developed fields and mines exceed the  carbon budget for a likely chance of staying  below 2°C. As a result of this arithmetic,  adding any new resource can logically do  only one of two things (in the absence of  CCS): either add to the excess of emissions  above 2°C, or cause an asset to be stranded  elsewhere.  Source: Oil Change International  Figure 9: The Carbon Supply Chain  4. WHY FOSSIL FUEL  SUPPLY MATTERS  WHY FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY MATTERS To illustrate what this means, we extend this  basic logic to all new sources of fossil fuel.  There are three scenarios:  Y Managed Decline: No further extraction  infrastructure is developed, existing  fields and mines are depleted over time,  and declining fossil fuel supplies are  replaced with clean alternatives to which  energy workers are redeployed, thus  preventing dangerous climate change.  Y Stranded Assets: Companies continue  to develop new fields and mines,  governments are eventually successful  in restricting emissions, and the resulting  reduction in demand causes many  extraction assets to become uneconomic  and shut down, causing destruction of  capital and large job losses.  Y Climate Chaos: Companies continue to  develop new fields and mines, none are  stranded, and the resulting emissions  take us well beyond 2°C of warming,  with resulting economic and human  catastrophe.  In reality, the scenarios are not mutually  exclusive – the future will be some  combination of all three. However, we know  that each new field or mine must contribute  to one of the following outcomes;  if developed it will either cause stranded  assets and/or dangerous climate change.  Figure 10 illustrates the situation: the  aggregate effect of many such decisions  will be to cause considerable warming  above 2°C, and/or considerable stranding  of assets.  The “managed decline” scenario is explored  in more detail in Section 5. This scenario  requires deliberate policy decisions to cease  development of new fields, mines, and  infrastructure.  If that decision is not made, economic  and political factors will determine the  ratio of “climate chaos” (see Section 1)  to “stranded assets,” which we outline  below. We will then consider how fossil  fuel supply relates to emissions, in order  to better identify the economic and  political factors that arbitrate between  the two scenarios.  STRANDED ASSETS  The concept of stranded assets has entered  the climate debate in the last few years,  especially through the work of Carbon  Tracker Initiative.51 It has been taken up by  many in the financial sector, including banks  such as HSBC52 and Citi,53 and Bank of  England Governor Mark Carney.If we assume that a combination of  government policy and technological  change is successful in limiting warming  to below 2°C or to 1.5°C (and that CCS  prospects do not radically improve),  demand for fossil fuels will fall rapidly,  resulting in a significant decrease in fossil  fuel commodity prices. This in turn will make  many extraction projects unprofitable,  leading to significant losses for investors.  To estimate the scale of stranding, Table  6 gives estimates of projected capital  expenditure over the next 20 years that  will potentially be wasted: over $10 trillion  in new oil fields, gas fields, and coal mines,  and up to $4 trillion in transportation  infrastructure such as pipelines, railways,  and port terminals. (For comparison,  projected ongoing and maintenance capital  expenditure on existing fields and mines is  just over $6 trillion).p  On top of this, there would be stranding of  downstream assets such as power plants  and refineries, the estimation of which is  beyond the scope of this report.  The “stranded assets” scenario is not  something we can regard as a problem  only for financial institutions. It would be  bad news for pension-holders, for those  employed by the fossil fuel industry, and for    Figure 10: Logic Tree of Fossil Fuel Supply vs. Emissions Restrictions  Source: Oil Change International  p Comprising $4.4 trillion on oil, $1.5 trillion on gas and $0.35 trillion on coal  32 WHY FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY MATTERS  the wider population dependent on a stable  economy. Inevitably, if fossil fuel extraction  is maintained or increased, then staying  within climate limits would require a much  faster pace of reductions than if a managed  decline begins now. This means much more  disruption, more expenditure on faster  development of alternative infrastructure,  and the loss of more jobs at a quicker rate.  “Stranded assets” is not the only scenario  that causes economic loss. On top  of the severe human costs of greater  disease, starvation, and lost homes, the  economic costs of climate change are vast,  encompassing infrastructure damage and  the decline of sectors such as agriculture  and insurance. Estimates since the Stern  Review of 2006 have commonly put the  impact at several percent of global GDP  by the late twenty-first century, and a  more recent study of historic correlations  between temperature and economic  activity suggested that unmitigated climate  change could cause as much as a 20%  reduction in 2100 output.57 Another study  on the impact on financial investments  estimated that $2.5 trillion of financial  assets could be at risk.58 The economic  disruption of climate change would also  cause major job losses across numerous  sectors, and would do so in a chaotic way  that would make transitional support even  more difficult.  In contrast to the combination of these two  costly scenarios, managed decline of fossil  fuel extraction offers a more reasonable  path forward.  SUPPLY AND DEMAND  In recent years, many governments have  adopted the apparently contradictory goals  of reducing emissions while encouraging  increased fossil fuel extraction. In the  absence of CCS, these two goals cannot  both be achieved at a global level: if  emissions are to be reduced, total fossil fuel  consumption must be reduced, which in  turn means that total fossil fuel extraction  must be reduced as well.  When pressed, governments and  companies tend to square the circle  by assuming that it is someone else’s  production that will get constrained and  some other investor’s bet that will go sour.  However, they never specify which other  country or company’s production they  anticipate will be stopped, or why, or how.  Some commentators insist that climate  change should only be addressed on the  demand side.59 But the trouble with this  view is that the act of increasing supply  makes it harder to cut emissions.  (i) More Supply = Lower Price =  Higher Demand  While climate policy has addressed fossil  fuels almost entirely on the demand side,  there has been an implicit assumption  that markets will then simply allocate the  aggregate demand between suppliers.  However, this is not how energy markets  work.Over the history of the modern energy  industry, there have been times when  demand has led events, and times when  supply has done so. For an illustration  of supply leading the way, consider the  present-day situation. U.S. oil extraction  expanded from 6.8 million barrels per  day (mbd) in 2010 to 11.7 mbd in 2014,stimulating a fall in price, which was  exacerbated when the Organization of the  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  decided in November 2014 not to cut its  production to compensate. The resulting  low oil prices led to global oil demand  growing at the fastest pace in five years,and to the fastest increase in U.S. gasoline  consumption since 1978.Table 6: Potential for Asset Stranding: Projected (Public and Private) Capital Expenditures on New Fields and Mines, 2014-35 (2012 Dollars)  Sources: International Energy Agency, Rystad UCube  WHY FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY MATTERS This should not be surprising, as it is what  basic economic theory tells us: supply does  not simply passively match demand, but  interacts with it in dynamic equilibrium.q  Figure 11 shows how supply and demand  interact: the actual quantity consumed  and produced is determined by the point  where the two lines cross. A policy designed  to increase extraction or lower its costs  – in this example, weak environmental  regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the  United States – will move the supply curve  to the right and/or downward. The resulting  new equilibrium has a lower price and a  higher quantity. In short, the increase of  supply has also increased consumption, and  thereby emissions.  (ii) Lock-In of Production  Once a field or mine has been developed,  it will generally keep producing. In other  words, the act of developing it locks in  future production. This is because once  capital has been expended, an investor  has strong incentives to avoid letting the  asset become stranded. This is illustrated  in Figure 12, where cash flow is negative  in the early phase as capital is invested.  The project only receives income once oil  production begins, after three years. In the  higher-price scenario, it takes a further nine  years to pay back the invested capital, and  the project finally begins making a profit  around Year Twelve. In the lower-price  scenario, the project never breaks even.  If the company knew beforehand – in Year  Zero – that the price would follow the  lower path, it would not move ahead with  the project. But once the project has been  developed, the economic incentives push  for continued production even if it means a  long-term loss on the capital invested, since  closing down would lead to an even greater  loss. As long as the red curve is rising in  Figure 12, continued production reduces the  ultimate loss. It is only if the price received  is less than the marginal operating cost (the  curve bends downward) that it is better to  stop before losses increase.    Figure 11: Impact of Policy to Encourage Supply on Supply / Demand Equilibrium In sum, a company will not proceed with a  new project if commodity prices are less  than the total operating and capital costs,  but will close down an-already developed  project only if prices hit the much lower  threshold of marginal operating costs. In  other words, any given action to reduce  demand becomes less effective as soon as  extraction projects have been developed  and operation is ongoing.  (iii) Perverse Political Effects  As well as the perverse economic impacts  of increasing fossil fuel supply, there are also  perverse political impacts. Governments  tend to act more strongly to protect existing  industries than to stimulate future ones,  because of the political clout of real jobs  held by identifiable people (as opposed  to abstract numbers), and because of the  lobbying power of dominant industries.  When fossil fuel prices are low,  governments often feel political pressure  to reduce taxes on fossil fuel production or  provide other subsidies to keep companies  producing. For example, the United  Kingdom cut the highest tax rate on North  Sea oil production from 80% to 68% in  2015 and again to 40% in 2016.64 Noting  declining profitability since 2011 (when coal  prices began their slide), the Indonesian  Coal Mining Association is calling for the  government to guarantee cost-based prices  in order to enable continued expansion.The effect of subsidies expanding or  maintaining supply translates through the  price mechanism again into increasing  demand and increased emissions.  q This mechanism breaks down if there is a perfect swing producer, which adjusts its own supply to maintain equilibrium at a certain level. Even before 2014, OPEC’s ability to act was  in reality limited by physical, political and economic factors (if it had been a perfect swing producer, the price would not have fluctuated). Now that Saudi Arabia and OPEC have  decided not to fulfil that role even partially, and instead to maximize their production, the market reflects this model.  34 WHY FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY MATTERS   Cash flow is the total income minus total (undepreciated) expenditure in any year. Discounting adjusts this to account for the time value of money, reflecting both the cost of capital  and the opportunity cost of not investing it elsewhere.    Twenty-five years of climate politics has  thoroughly embedded the notion that  climate change should be addressed at the  point of emissions, while the supply of fossil  fuels should be left to the market. That view  is now no longer supportable (if in fact it  ever was). Our analysis indicates a hard limit  on the amount of fossil fuels that can be  extracted, pointing to an intervention that  can only be implemented by governments.  We conclude that:  Y Governments should issue no further  leases or permits for new oil, gas, or coal  extraction projects or transportation  infrastructure.  While this would mark a significant change  in the direction of climate policy, it is also  the least disruptive and least painful option.  As we saw in the previous section, in the  absence of a dramatic turnaround for CCS,  further building of fossil fuel extraction  infrastructure will lead us only to two  possible futures, both of which entail vast  economic and social costs.  What we propose in this report is the  easiest global approach to restraint: when  in a hole, stop digging.  A GRADUAL TRANSITION  Existing fields and mines contain a large  amount of oil, gas, and coal, which will be  extracted over time. Rates of extraction  will decline without development of new  resources and infrastructure, but the decline  is far from precipitous. The fastest decline  will be in fracked shale, where wells produce  for only a few years. Other fields often last  much longer.  Figures 13 and 14 show Rystad’s projection  of oil and gas extraction from existing fields  and those under construction, in its oil price  base cases: extraction (and hence global  supply) would fall by 50% by the early  2030s. Data is not available for coal.  This projection should not be alarming.  Remember that emissions must decline  rapidly, to net zero by 2070, for a likely  chance of staying below 2°C, or by 2050  for a medium chance of staying below  1.5°C (see Figure 1 on page 13). For  emissions to decline, fossil fuel use (and  consequently extraction) must decline at  the same overall rate.  Simply restricting supply alone would lead  to increased prices, potentially making  marginal production in existing fields  and mines viable. The amount ultimately  extracted and emitted would still be lower  (see Figure 11 on page 34), but may not  be as low as carbon budgets allow. A  more powerful policy approach would  be to pursue reductions in supply and  demand simultaneously. As long as the  two remain roughly in sync, prices will  remain more stable, and “leakage” – where  reductions in one country’s extraction are  offset by increased extraction in another  country – will be minimized. The two  policy approaches can also be mutually  reinforcing, as declining supply of fossil  fuels stimulates more private investment in  alternatives, and vice versa.  s A higher price would lead to slower decline, as companies would invest more capital expenditures even in existing fields. Conversely, a lower price would lead to faster decline.  MAKING AN ENERGY TRANSITION HAPPEN BOX 3: The Remarkable Growth in Renewable Energy  Renewable power generation is growing exponentially: wind at  around 20% per year globally, and solar at around 35% per year.Wind generation has more than doubled since 2010, while solar  has doubled nearly three times in that period. Compounded over  many years, these growth rates add up rapidly: if wind and solar  sustained their current global growth rates, they would exceed  current coal and gas power generation in 2029.69 At some point,  growth rates will slow down, but there is no indication that it is  happening yet.  Denmark, a relatively small country, generates 40% of its  electricity from renewables (mainly wind), and is aiming for 100%  renewable generation by 2035.70 In 2015, Germany – the world’s  fourth largest economy – generated nearly one-third of its power  from renewables, primarily wind and solar.Small and large developing countries are moving to renewables  too. Costa Rica produces 99% of its electricity from renewable  sources, including hydro, wind, and geothermal.72 Neighbouring  Nicaragua generates up to 20% of its electricity from wind, and  16% from geothermal.73 Djibouti is aiming for 100% of its energy  to be renewable by 2020, much of it off-grid solar.74 Vanuatu  currently generates 43% of its electricity from renewables, and  aims for 65% by 2020 and 100% by 2030, with much of the  growth coming from grid-connected wind and solar, and off-grid  solar.75 In absolute terms, China is set to overtake the United  States in 2016 as the largest generator of wind and solar power.China is also showing the fastest growth in wind and solar  installations: 2015 was a record year in which its wind capacity  grew by 33.5% and grid connected solar capacity by 73.7%.India has a target of a twenty-fold increase in solar power to 100  GW by 2022, which would take it to more than twice China’s  current level.In many countries, wind and solar are already cost-competitive  with fossil fuel and nuclear power generation. A recent Deutsche  Bank survey of sixty countries found that solar has reached grid  parity in fully half of the countries already.79 And costs are falling  fast. The International Renewable Energy Agency reports that  the levelized cost of electricity from utility-scale solar fell by 58%  between 2010 and 2015, and could fall by a further 59% between  2015 and 2025.New transportation technologies, specifically electric vehicles  (EVs), are also developing fast. Battery costs – a major element  of the price of an EV – are falling quickly, as lithium-ion battery  costs fell 65% from 2010 to 2015.81 Further cost declines and  performance improvements are widely expected, with some  projecting a further 60% cost decline by 2020.82 Financier UBS  predicts that by the early 2020s, the purchase price of an EV will  be only very slightly higher than a petroleum-fueled car, with only  small a fraction of the fuel and maintenance costs.In 2016 and 2017, three different mass-market, long-range electric  car models are being launched in the United States, with dozens  more expected by 2020. China aims to have five million EVs on  the road by 2020, while several European countries (including  Norway, France and Germany) have recently announced that  they to no longer allow sales of petroleum-fueled cars after either  2025 or 2030.An oil storage facility in Linden, New Jersey USA.    Renewable power technologies are not only  possible; they are already in use at scale in  many countries, growing rapidly, and often  cost less than gas or coal generation (see  Box 3). Electric vehicles are at an earlier  stage of development than renewable  power, but may be able to penetrate the  market more rapidly: whereas a power  plant has a typical lifetime of 40 years, cars  generally last for around ten years.  A common objection to renewable energy  relates to the challenges of intermittency.  However, this problem is often overstated.  For example, the chief executive officer  of the northeast Germany electrical grid  says the country can get up to 70% to 80%  wind and solar even without “additional  flexibility options” such as storage.85 A 2012  report by the National Renewable Energy  Laboratory found that with existing storage  capacity, the U.S. grid can handle as much  as 50% wind and solar penetration.86 To go  further, affordable storage solutions are  now emerging, from lithium ion batteries  to compressed air and others. Residential  battery storage systems entered the  mainstream market in the US and Australia  in 2015, and the coming years are also  expected to see increasing deployment of  grid-scale storage.87 The bigger challenges  will be expanding renewable energy in  weaker grids in developing countries,  emphasizing again the importance of  climate finance to facilitate the transition.  We now examine what is needed to  replace depleting fossil fuel extraction,  by comparing the residual oil and gas  demand that will remain while aggressively  moving to clean energy, with natural  depletion of existing oil and gas fields  (as shown in Figures 13 and 14, on page  37). Using a simple model of progressive  electrification of energy-consuming sectors  and progressive conversion of electricity  generation to renewables, we convert the  final energy consumption projected in the  IEA’s 450 Scenario in two scenarios: 50%  renewable energy by 2035 and 80% by  2045. In both we assume a complete phaseout  of  coal usage, except in steel production.  The results are shown in Figure 15 (see  detailed calculation and assumptions in  Appendix 4).We see in the Figure that in 2035, expected  oil and gas production from existing fields  roughly matches the requirement with a  50% renewable energy penetration. Further  depletion to 2045 leaves greater production  than would be required while moving to  80% renewable energy.  Figure 15: Final Energy Consumption by Source With 50% Renewable Penetration in 2035 and 80% in 2045,  Compared to Depletion of Existing Oil and Gas Fields (See Appendix 4)  Sources: IEA, Mark Jacobson et al, Rystad Energy, Oil Change International analysis  Gas Oil Coal Nuclear, Bio & Other Renewable    40 MAKING AN ENERGY TRANSITION HAPPEN  Figure 16: Projected Power Demand and Fuel Source, in Jacobson et al’s Roadmap for 139 Countries  Source: Mark Jacobson et al  Mark Jacobson of Stanford University  and colleagues have developed detailed  roadmaps for how 139 countries could  achieve 80% renewable energy by 2030,  and 100% by 2050, as shown in Figure 16.89  These are much faster rates of conversion  than we have outlined above. For each  country’s projected energy demand  – including electricity, transportation,  heating/cooling, and industry – Jacobson’s  team considers what level of each  renewable energy source would be  required, using only technologies that are  available today. They take into account the  wind, solar and water resource, land area  and infrastructure for each country, and  allow for intermittency. A small proportion  of transportation and industrial energy uses  hydrogen as a fuel carrier.  What Jacobson and his colleagues  have shown is the technical feasibility of  obtaining 100% of energy from wind, water  and solar by 2050, and 80% of it by 2030.  The technology can deliver, and there is  sufficient available resource, while taking  up just 0.25% of the 139-country land area,  mostly in deserts and barren land (plus  a further 0.7% for spacing between wind  turbines, which can be used at the same  time for farmland, ranchland, grazing land,  or open space). They have also shown that  the transformation will create a major net  addition to the number of energy jobs,  compared to continuing with fossil fuels.  Jacobson’s calculations are not just a  theoretical possibility. In a global survey of  1,600 energy professionals by consultancy  DNV GL, nearly half of respondents said  they believed the electricity system they  work in could achieve 70% renewable  generation by 2030, if there were sufficient  political will.How much does all this cost? Over recent  years, estimates of clean energy costs have  been consistently revised downward, while  estimates of the cost of climate change have  been revised upwards. In many parts of the  world, wind and solar are cost-competitive  with gas and coal power generation, and  with fast-falling costs they soon will be  elsewhere as well (see Box 3).  Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF)  estimates that by 2027, it will be as cheap  to build a new wind or solar plant as to  run an existing coal or gas plant. BNEF  projects that to have a 50% chance of  keeping warming to 2°C, $14 trillion of  clean energy investments would be needed  over the next 25 years; however, $9 trillion  would occur even in the absence of policy  intervention.91 While in this report we focus  on achieving a greater probability of staying  below 2°C, and aiming for 1.5°C, which  MAKING AN ENERGY TRANSITION HAPPEN would require a greater proportion of clean  energy, the BNEF estimate gives a useful  ballpark figure. It should be compared with  the projected $14 trillion in new fossil fuel  extraction and transportation (Section 4),  not to mention investment in power plants  and refineries.  As a result of increasing cost-competitiveness,  much new energy  investment is now indeed going into clean  energy. However, the rates of renewable  penetration in Figure 15 – sufficient to  replace fossil fuel decline – are greater  than would occur due to market forces  alone. The point is that policy intervention  is needed to drive investment decisions  solely into clean energy, to build sufficient  institutional capacity to carry out the  investments, and to stop expansion of fossil  fuels. The cost competitiveness shows that  the net cost of those interventions will be  modest, or even negative. We would further  note that one of the biggest barriers to the  transition is the estimated $452 billion G20  countries currently provide in subsidies  every year to fossil fuel extraction.Is such a large-scale transformation  possible, at such a speed? Benjamin  Sovacool of Aarhus University has pointed  to several energy transformations at the  national-level – in both end-use and supply  technologies – that took place on these kind  of timescales, shown in Table 7.93 In several  cases, a concerted and coordinated effort  by government was vital to facilitating the  transition, through subsidies, establishing  pilot programs, retraining workers, and  regulation. A worldwide transition away  from fossil fuels is of course a larger and  more complex undertaking than these  examples, but as Sovacool notes, “previous  transitions may have been accidental or  circumstantial, whereas future transitions  could become more planned and  coordinated, or backed by aggressive social  movements or progressive government  targets.”  We conclude that:  Y Gradual decline of fossil fuel extraction  by depleting existing oil and gas fields  and phasing out coal is replaceable with  existing clean energy technologies, without  major extra cost.      JUST TRANSITION  The implications of limiting global warming  to below either 2°C or 1.5°C are significant.  It will require a fundamental transformation  of the energy industry, beginning  immediately and taking place over the next  three to four decades. There are many  advantages to this transition, even aside  from its necessity to prevent dangerous  climate change:  Y Renewable energy sources generate  power more cheaply than coal or gas in  many parts of the world, and soon will do  so nearly everywhere (see Box 3).  Y Electric vehicles commonly offer higher  performance than internal combustion  engines, and are also expected to be  cheaper within the next five years.  Y Clean energy industries employ many  more people per dollar invested and  per GWh generated than fossil fuel  industries. A study by the United Nations  Industrial Development Organization  found that $1 million creates twice as  many jobs if invested in renewable  energy and energy efficiency as it would  if invested in fossil fuels.94 Meanwhile, the  United Kingdom Energy Research Centre  finds that a GWh of electricity from wind  and solar creates five times as many  jobs on average as a GWh of electricity  generated from gas and coal.Y Reduced fossil fuel pollution will have  massive benefits for health: coal burning  alone is estimated to cause 366,000  deaths per year in China and 100,000  per year in India.Y Some analysts argue that given  diminishing returns from developing  oil and gas at the frontiers, investors  in oil companies would obtain higher  returns from a phased wind-down of  the companies than by their high-cost  continuation.However, the process of transition will not  necessarily be painless for individuals,  companies, regions, and countries. It will  affect fossil fuel energy workers, many of  whom may not have the right skills or be  in the right location to smoothly transition  into clean energy jobs. It will also affect  people working to service fossil-based  utilities and worksites, whose positions are  often more precarious than jobs directly  in energy companies. Many energy jobs  lie in construction rather than operations,  and so in the short term, an end to fossil  fuel construction may lead to a more rapid  decline in job numbers than in volumes of  fossil fuels. Communities may be hit by a  loss of revenue or local economic activity,  and cultural impacts in places where a  community has been long associated with a  particular employer or industry.  Action by governments is therefore  needed to conduct the energy transition  in a way that maximizes the benefits of  climate action while minimizing hardships  for workers and their communities. Trade  unions and others have developed a  framework for a just transition in relation to  climate change, the importance of which  is recognized in the preamble of the Paris  Agreement.98 In 2015 the International  Labour Organization adopted guidelines  on just transition.99 Key elements of a just  transition include:1Y Sound investments in low-emission and  job-rich sectors and technologies.  Y Social dialogue and democratic  consultation of social partners (trade  unions and employers) and other  stakeholders (such as communities).  Y Research and early assessment of the  social and employment impacts of  climate policies.  Y Training and skills development  to support the deployment of new  technologies and foster industrial  change.  Y Social protection alongside active labor  markets policies.  Y Local economic diversification plans  that support decent work and provide  community stability in the transition.  As Jeremy Brecher of Labor Network  for Sustainability points out, all of this  is achievable and has several relevant  precedents in the United States.101 At  the end of World War II, the G.I. Bill of  Rights provided education and training,  loan guarantees for homes, farms, and  businesses, and unemployment pay for  returning veterans. It was vital to their  reintegration into American society and to  the transition to peace. Another military  example was the 2005 Base Realignment  and Closing Commission (BRAC), which  provided communities around closing bases  with planning and economic assistance,  environmental cleanup, community  development grants, and funding for  community services, as well as counselling  and preferential hiring for affected workers.  In the energy sector, the current Obama  Administration Power+ Plan, which offers  support for communities previously  dependent on coal, has many of the  features of a just transition, including  funding for job training, job creation, and  economic diversification.  The job and skill profiles of workers who  could potentially be affected vary widely,  and therefore require different strategies.  For workers currently employed in fossil fuel  extraction or use, incumbent companies  must support workers and either offer  career progress in non-fossil fuel parts  of the company or provide them with  transferable skills to navigate the labor  market with better chances for success.  For communities and workers that depend  indirectly on fossil fuel economic activity,  public authorities must anticipate the need  for new sources of revenue and support  investments to transform their economies.  The most critical questions lie in how  industry and policymakers will conduct  an orderly and managed decline of fossil  fuel extraction, with robust planning for  economic and energy diversification. As  Anabella Rosemberg of the International  Trade Union Confederation writes, “Job  losses are not an automatic consequence  of climate policies, but the consequence  of a lack of investment, social policies, and  anticipation.”1National governments should seek to  stimulate new economic growth in regions  previously dependent on fossil fuel  industries, and in new industries to take  their place. Most importantly, leaving things  until carbon budgets are mostly exhausted  would result in disruptive change that  would be sudden, costly, and painful. By  starting now, the transition can be managed  efficiently and fairly, to the maximum  benefit of everyone involved.  6. CONCLUSION  In the Paris Agreement, 195 governments agreed to limit global warming to “well below  2°C” above pre-industrial levels, and to aim for a temperature increase of not more than  1.5°C. In this report, we have used the concept of carbon budgets, drawn from the Fifth  Assessment Report of the IPCC, to explore what this would mean in practice.  We find that the oil, gas, and coal in already-developed fields and mines (that is, where the  infrastructure has been built) exceeds the amount that can be burned while likely staying  below 2°C, and significantly exceeds the amount that can be burned while staying below  1.5°C. Any new fossil fuel infrastructure that is built would require a corresponding early  retirement of existing infrastructure. Given the political and economic difficulties of closing  down existing facilities, we recommend that:  Y No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built worldwide.  Instead, we should allow for the gradual decline of existing operations, over the coming  decades, and invest strongly in clean energy to make up the difference. We have seen that  there is no economic or technical barrier to making this transition over this time frame: the  only requirement is political will.  To minimize the costs of the transition, governments should conduct robust planning for  economic and energy diversification. The principles of just transition should be applied, to  ensure workers and communities benefit from the shift to a clean energy economy, rather  than be harmed by it.  The conclusions in this report will take some by surprise, and cause alarm with others.  They imply serious alterations to the global economy, will be resisted by some of the  most profitable companies ever known, and will necessitate bold and decisive action by  governments on a scale not seen thus far.  But the conclusions are also remarkably straightforward at their core. To keep from burning  more fossil fuels than our atmosphere can withstand, we must stop digging them out of the  ground. With this report, we put forward recommendations on how to go about doing just  that in a sufficient, equitable, economically efficient, and just fashion.  Vehicles work at an open-pit coal mine near Ordos in  northern China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 2015.  Since fossil fuel reserves are located  beneath the earth’s surface, estimating  their quantity is based on inherently limited  information drawing on interpretation  and judgment of geological data, as well  as assumptions about economics and  operations. Quantities of reserves are  therefore distinguished by the degree of  confidence in them: proven, probable,  and possible.  The most commonly cited estimates  for reserves in fact refer only to proven  reserves, a quantity defined (where  probabilistic methods are used) as having  a 90% likelihood that the amount actually  recovered will exceed the estimated  amount. 103 This is because the principal  use of the concept of reserves is to help  investors assess the value of a company by  providing an indicator of its future potential  production. For this purpose, the most  relevant estimate is the more certain one,  as it carries less risk.  Since it requires such a high degree of  confidence, the proven reserves figure  understates what can be expected to in  fact be extracted, even based on current  knowledge. For anticipating the future  impact on the climate (or indeed on energy  markets), it is more relevant to consider a  realistic estimate of what will be extracted.  In this report, we therefore also state  probable reserves of oil and gas, taking  proven plus probable to refer to the best  estimate of the quantity that will ultimately  be extracted in the absence of climate  constraints. We interpret this as the mean  (expected) value.t  Contrary to what might then have been  expected, the proven-plus-probable  reserves figures we use in this report  are actually lower than those in the BP  Statistical Review of World Energy, which  claims to give proven reserves. The reason  is that BP takes at face value the amounts  claimed by countries such as Venezuela,  Saudi Arabia, and Canada, whose  measurements lack transparency, are widely  suspected to be inflated, and/or rely on  broader-than-usual definitions of proven  reserves. Rystad Energy – our source of  reserves data – instead makes judgments of  what reserves are realistically extractable.1Estimates of probable reserves are harder  to obtain than of proven. In particular, there  are no reliable data available for probable  reserves of coal, and definitions vary  significantly between countries. Even data  on proven coal reserves is of much poorer  quality than data on oil and gas, for which  there have been efforts to align definitions  and compile global reserves data from  company and government reports.v The IEA  notes that due to the sheer scale of coal  reserves and substitution by gas, there has  been little interest in coal surveys since the  start of the twenty-first century.1The implication is that the quantity of  reserves is a less important determinant of  future production for coal than for oil and  gas (another important underlying factor  is air pollution regulations).108 For these  reasons, in this report we use only proven  reserves for coal.

In this area of Peru, glaciers are retreating, affecting communities who depend on melt water. Photo: Gilvan Barreto/Oxfam GB (2008) BREAKING THE STANDOFF Post-2020 climate finance in the Paris agreement  Climate finance is fundamental to a fair and effective global climate agreement. Too few countries have delivered on their obligations. As a result the world’s poorest people have not benefitted from the necessary investment, and climate finance has been a major obstacle to achieving a global climate change agreement.  A new approach that recognizes the failings of the current regime and is better informed by needs and opportunities at the national level can break the current standoff and trigger a collaborative effort that delivers effective investment at scale in both mitigation and adaptation. This, along with ambitious emissions reduction pledges by developed countries, is key to success in the 2015 Paris climate negotiations.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  BREAKING THE STAND-OFF  Negotiations are currently under way to develop a new international climate change agreement that will cover all countries and curb global warming to below the internationally agreed limit of 2 degrees. The new agreement will be adopted at the United Nations Climate Change Conference – Conference of the Parties 21, or COP21 – to be held in Paris in November/December 2015, and will be implemented from 2020.  International climate finance – the international support to help developing countries adapt to climate change and enable low-carbon development – must be at the heart of the Paris agreement. It offers the key to unlocking mitigation potential in developing countries and enabling communities to adapt to current and future impacts. It is also a basic building block of a fair agreement: one that accords with countries‟ relative responsibilities for the problem, and their capabilities to address it.  Yet for too long finance has been branded as a stumbling block, hindering progress at the negotiating table. To be able to commit to low-carbon development pathways, developing countries need the confidence that they will receive adequate and on-going support from developed countries, who need to accept that it is in their own national interests to deliver. But with a new and revitalized approach to the climate finance discussions, negotiators in Lima and Paris can break through this standoff and unlock a brighter future for developing and developed countries alike.  Oxfam proposes a new approach that is guided by the lessons learnt from the failings of the current climate finance regime, as well as by a better understanding of climate finance need and potential at national level. This finance blueprint for Paris for the first time gets down to business in terms of who pays and who receives, and how much.  Lessons learnt from the $100bn regime  The current commitment among developed countries made in Cancun and Copenhagen1 – to jointly mobilize $100bn by 2020 from a variety of sources to address the needs of developing countries – has exacerbated the climate finance standoff.  The $100bn commitment has become an iconic reference point in global negotiations, haggled over by negotiators and the source of much of the discontent and many of the problems that have dogged climate finance negotiations over the past five years.  Progress in meeting this goal has been too slow. Current climate finance levels have flat-lined since the Fast Start Finance period, and despite recent progress with filling the Green Climate Fund to the bare minimum mark needed to get the new fund up and running, developed countries remain off-track for bringing up climate finance levels to meet their overall promise. One of the reasons for this is  the vague nature of the target itself. Too few details have been agreed by negotiators about how financial flows will be mobilized, which countries will mobilize them and which countries will receive them. This has undermined developing countries‟ ability to create effective plans for their adaptation and mitigation needs.  There are four key shortcomings of the $100bn approach, where the post-Paris agreement must do better.  1. $100bn is not enough to address the problem. It is too low a target if it is to come from both public and private sources, and too little if it is to be spread between both adaptation and mitigation.  2. Everyone and no-one is accountable. It is a target for all developed countries, meaning that no specific country has committed to a quantified pathway for scaling up towards it. Meanwhile all developing countries are entitled in theory to receive it, but none knows how much it might receive from one year to the next, making planning impossible.  3. There is too little clarity on rules for what counts, especially in terms of private finance: whether money is new and additional; whether loans can be used etc. – making it even harder to hold countries to account for real and comparable increases in finance.  4. Ultimately, it has become an abstract number that Parties fight over in the world of the UNFCCC, which is too far removed from the real business of cutting emissions and supporting vulnerable communities. It is time this changed.  From abstract global numbers to a focus on concrete national needs and potential  Success in Paris will mean negotiating a finance package that recognizes the true scale of the overall challenge – both in mitigation and adaptation – yet is responsive to the needs and specificities in given countries.  This paper puts forward some numbers which indicate the scale of the financing challenge, drawing both on a synthesis of available global estimates, and a close look at existing national-level plans.  For mitigation, Parties should collectively recognize and commit to bridge a mitigation investment gap in the order of several $100bn per year, perhaps in excess of $500bn per year (in both public and private finance). This is the difference between current investment levels and what the latest models estimate is needed to shift the world onto a 2 degrees pathway.  For adaptation, Parties should collectively recognize and commit to bridge the scale of the public adaptation finance gap. Adaptation needs will increase the more temperatures are allowed to rise, so the target must be determined based on the mitigation ambition of agreement – for example in a 2ºC agreement, global estimates indicate an additional $60bn per year will be needed by 2050s for sub-Saharan Africa. Developed countries should commit to channel a significant proportion of these funds through the Green Climate Fund.  While a collective commitment to closing this gap is crucial to the Paris agreement, achieving real progress lies in ensuring support at the country level.  Countries should decide in Paris to launch a process to agree country-specific national financing schedules. For developing countries, this means national plans outlining actions and the support required for their implementation. For developed countries, it means detailing what support they will be providing to realize these plans. This paper looks at how these national schedules for both developed and developing countries relate to the collective commitment, how they can fit into the Paris agreement, and how they will be revised over time.  Matching pledges to tangible action in this way can transform climate finance into a tool to trigger a collaborative effort towards unlocking concrete opportunities. A closer reading of country plans shows that if progress is made on climate finance, the clean development that poor countries can achieve could be spectacular. For instance, the Ethiopian government has already spelled out how proper support could lift millions of people out of poverty while avoiding annual emissions equivalent to 65 coal-fired power plants. Indonesia could fulfill its plan to cut emissions by 41 percent in 15 years. And Peru could increase its GDP by nearly 1 percent more than business-as-usual, while halving its emissions at the same time.  This paper shows how the combination of a collective commitment to closing the global financing gap with country-specific national financing schedules for both developed and developing countries may hold the key to breaking the stand-off.  Finance and equity  Much negotiating between now and the Paris COP will focus on the issue of effort sharing. For most industrialized countries, a fair share of the global mitigation effort amounts to far greater emissions reductions than can be achieved solely within their own borders. Furthermore, poorer countries cannot be expected to meet the additional cost of implementing low-carbon development strategies and are entitled to receive support for their mitigation efforts.  Put simply, climate finance is an intrinsic part of the effort-sharing equation. For wealthier countries, contributions under the Paris agreement must include both the Party‟s commitment to reducing domestic emissions and the support it will provide to low-carbon development in other countries. Similarly, poorer countries must be enabled to indicate progressively the amount of finance they will need to implement their plans.  Oxfam offers one possible framework for calculating fair shares – to benchmark who contributes what and to bring new contributors into the picture. On this basis, a number of countries that have not been expected to contribute resources until now should prepare to step up.  Oxfam‟s calculation of country „fair shares‟ estimates that the US would be responsible for mobilizing 56 percent of the international climate finance needed to shift the world onto a low-carbon path during the first commitment period of the new agreement, followed by 22 percent from the EU and 10 percent from Japan. This would be in addition to the emissions reductions they are responsible for delivering within their own borders. New contributors include Brazil, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.  When it comes to contributing to international climate finance for adaptation, new countries which should become climate finance contributors including Russia,  Brazil, the Republic of Korea and Mexico. This list of contributors and their shares differ slightly when it comes to contributing towards international adaptation finance, as different considerations are at play. Unlike with mitigation, international responsibilities are not affected by the size of borders and the potential contained within them to reduce emissions.  KEY RECOMMENDATIONS  Oxfam proposes that a successful Paris climate agreement should include a financial package with the following elements:  1. Recognition of the scale of the investment gap and a shared commitment to closing it  No strategy for change is credible unless it is costed. Furthermore, asking developing countries to commit to strong action without a quantitative commitment of support is unrealistic.  2. A system of individual contributions and entitlements captured alongside the agreement  Contributors may face constitutional barriers to making multi-year commitments, and few developing countries have yet identified their individual financing needs. However, a system of dynamic country-by-country financing schedules annexed to the agreement can circumvent these constraints, provide the necessary predictability, identify opportunities and continually build cooperation and collaboration between contributors and recipients.  3. A separate collective target for public finance for adaptation  Experience to date has clearly demonstrated that only a separate public finance target for adaptation is likely to close the adaptation finance gap.  4. Both top-down and bottom-up methods  The collective commitment must be firmly grounded in the science. And if ambition on mitigation is too low, this must trigger greater support for adaptation. Bottom-up national-level plans, put forward between 2015 and 2020, are needed to identify opportunities, inform negotiations on financing schedules and drive an upward spiral of greater ambition.  5. A fair shares system  Without guidance on how much countries should contribute or what they are entitled to receive, there is little prospect of real progress. Separate frameworks should be established for mitigation and adaptation, both based on the principles of the UNFCCC.  6. Robust accounting  At a minimum, this means limiting the proportion of finance provided as loans, counting only the grant equivalent of loans and finding a definition of „new and additional‟ that will stick.  7. New commitments to establishing innovative sources of public finance  There can be no more shift in current ODA flows to climate finance, and greater reliability and predictability are needed. Put simply, new sources of public finance are needed and Parties must make an action plan aimed at getting the most  promising national and international schemes off the ground.  8. New commitments to shifting private finance  Far more can and must be done to help channel private investment. Parties should capture in the Paris agreement the principles, commitments and safeguards necessary to unleash investment in equitable low-carbon solutions.  1 THE CHOICES  Success in Paris in 2015 means unlocking the maximum potential for mitigation in all countries and ensuring adequate support for adaptation. To achieve these goals, the Parties will need to agree a robust and fair set of finance commitments as part of the Paris agreement.  The following sections lay out systematically the key choices that now face government negotiators, relating to both quantitative and qualitative commitments on finance for the post-2020 regime. For arrangements to be fair, to accord with the science and to build sufficient trust and confidence between Parties, negotiators will need to take on board a number of key lessons from the $100bn Copenhagen/Cancun commitments.  QUANTITATIVE COMMITMENTS  A. Collective or individual contributions and entitlements?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  The $100bn Copenhagen agreement was a collective target applied to all developed countries, with all developing countries being eligible to receive resources. However, this arrangement has meant, firstly, that no developed country can be held to account for delivering any particular share of the total. As a result it has proved a major challenge to establish a clear pathway to reaching the collective target, and available data indicates that developed countries have failed to collectively scale up their public finance contributions towards the $100bn goal beyond the levels reached under the Fast Start Finance (FSF) period of 2010–12.Secondly, the arrangement has meant that no developing country can be certain of what level of resources it might expect to receive. This has hindered the predictability of finance – a key principle in ensuring effective use of climate finance resources.3 There has also been a disproportionate flow of funds to certain countries at the expense of others.Learning from these lessons, Parties should consider alternative options, drawing on examples from financing commitments in other international settings, as set out in Table 1A.  Contributions  A single collective contribution  Individual, country-specific contributions  Hybrid*  Entitlements  Overall developing country entitlement E.g. the Copenhagen/ Cancun $100bn commitment E.g. L‟Aquila Food Security Initiative, in which qualitative contributions from specific countries were made to an unspecified list of developing countriesIndividual country-specific entitlements E.g. National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs), in which a collective commitment was made by developed countries to fully fund individual country-specific adaptation needs, as identified by those countries E.g. G8 Gleneagles aid commitments, which included a commitment to $50bn specifically for Africa, with each G8 country to contribute a specified amountHybrid** See Oxfam’s choice, outlined below  * A collective contribution target in the legal agreement, individual contributions in a separate document.  ** Collective entitlement in the legal agreement, individual entitlements in a separate document.  Oxfam’s choice  The agreement must recognize the scale of the overall investment challenge (across all countries) and the amount that must be met through international support.  Oxfam proposes that the Paris agreement should include both a collective contribution/entitlement enshrined in the legal agreement itself, and a system of individual contributions and entitlements captured in a complementary form outside of the core agreement.  Some form of collective contribution/entitlement is vital, as there must be clarity on the overall scale of finance required to meet the agreed 2°C goal and adaptation needs, and a clear commitment to it being provided, which should be captured in the core and legally binding international agreement. Some developed country Parties are seeking to backtrack from any reference at all to quantitative or numerical finance commitments. But offering an agreement in Paris without any finance numbers to support developing countries to transition to and remain on a low-carbon path is unrealistic. Unless financial commitments are made upfront, there is very little reason to believe that they will be forthcoming later. The bare minimum that developing countries should expect is recognition of the scale of the financing challenge and a specific collective commitment to address it.  However, the Copenhagen experience shows that a collective commitment alone is not enough. Many developed countries face legal or constitutional barriers to making individual, multi-annual budgetary commitments under a legally binding international agreement. Concurrently few developing countries are yet in a position to clearly and strategically identify their core financing needs – for either ambitious low-carbon pathways or adequate climate-resilient ones.  As a result, Oxfam proposes that country-specific contributions and entitlements should not be included in the core international agreement due to be struck in Paris. The Paris agreement would, however, include a collective commitment for shifting financial flows globally and would set specific targets for contributing countries related to the provision of support. It would also include a process for country-by-country financing schedules to be annexed to the agreement between 2015 and 2020. Contributing countries would provide details of the types, levels and instruments of finance they aim to provide and mobilize. Developing countries would set out how they would scale up their ambitions, subject to the international support available. A first iteration of these schedules would be adopted in 2020 with a subsequent, iterative process to enhance both schedules. These would not be legally binding and could contain necessary caveats for contributing countries – such as „subject to parliamentary approval‟ – but would nonetheless offer greater predictability of financing for recipient countries.  Such an approach will also allow the agreement to respond constructively to the challenge of determining the scale of quantitative finance commitments, and how much individual countries should be entitled to receive – assessed under choices C and D below.  B. A single target?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  The Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn agreement was a catch-all target intended to cover both mitigation and adaptation (as well as REDD-plus, technology development and transfer, and capacity building), derived from „a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance‟.This typically vague formulation may have allowed decisions to be reached in Copenhagen and Cancun, but it sowed the seeds of years of argument and contestation. Rather than constructive ambiguity, it is an approach that has led to a destructive antipathy and one that should be avoided going forward.  More specifically, the lack of clarity over the division of resources to come from public and private sources has meant that contributing countries have been able to evade any accountability for their flat-lining – and in some cases declining – public finance contributions, as they have progressively sought to shift the focus onto private flows.8 While private finance is clearly central to meeting the climate challenge, the need for substantial public resources is undeniable for both mitigation9 and adaptation,10 and a failure to specify the amount of public finance needed has simply meant that not enough is flowing. Furthermore, the suggestion that a combined $100bn of private and public finance is sufficient substantially understates the overall investment challenge.  Meanwhile, the lack of clarity over the balance to be struck between resources for adaptation and mitigation has served to perpetuate the longstanding gap in adaptation financing, in which the lion‟s share of resources continues to flow to mitigation rather than adaptation (and primarily to middle-income rather than the poorest countries as a result).11 This is in spite of the FSF commitment calling for a „balanced allocation between mitigation and adaptation‟12 and recent COP decisions which have called on developed country Parties to „channel a substantial share of public climate funds to adaptation activities‟.Learning from these lessons, Parties might consider alternative options for setting more disaggregated qualitative targets, as set out in Table 1B.  Table 1B: Adaptation/mitigation and public/private – a single target or disaggregated targets?  Public/private  Mixed, no guidance on balance  Mixed, guidance on balance  Separate targets  Adaptation/mitigation  Mixed, no guidance on balance E.g. Copenhagen Accord/Cancun Agreements, in which $100bn/year was committed from both public and private sources, for both adaptation and mitigation  E.g. the establishment of the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in 2012 included the target of securing Letters of Intent from private sector companies to „invest over $3 billion across the agricultural value chain in Grow Africa countries‟, alongside a „goal of securing commitments of $1.2 billion over three years‟ primarily from public donors for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP)Mixed, guidance on balance E.g. Fast Start Finance (FSF) commitment in which $30bn over three years was committed, with a requirement that it should be „balanced between adaptation and mitigation‟. While no formal de jure guidance was given with regard to the balance between public and private finance, the commitment was widely interpreted de facto to entail 100 per cent public finance E.g. the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Executive Board has set a target of a  balance between adaptation and mitigation over timeE.g. FSF commitment in which $30bn over three years was committed, with a requirement that it should be „balanced between adaptation and mitigation‟.  While no formal guidance was given with regard to the balance between public and private finance, the commitment has been widely interpreted de facto to entail 100 per cent public finance  Separate targets See Oxfam’s choice on mitigation  E.g. National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) in which developing countries made an adaptation-specific commitment to public finance  See Oxfam’s choice on adaptation  Oxfam’s choice  Oxfam proposes that the Paris agreement should include a separate collective target for public finance for adaptation and a separate collective target for closing the global investment gap in mitigation (which requires finance from a mix of public and private sources), which could include a sub-target for the provision of public finance from contributing countries.  Unlike with mitigation, the vast majority of adaptation efforts need public financing, because – among other reasons – the measures required, such as flood defences or national disaster planning, do not generate returns and the communities in need are often rural, poor and of no interest to the private sector.16 That said, there are various ways in which the private sector can support adaptation:17 for instance, the capital market can be used to frontload pledges from donor governments via bonds. However, a public-only adaptation finance target is needed to incentivize adaptation finance.  A separate public finance target for adaptation is the only guaranteed means of closing the adaptation finance gap. This gap is recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and US Climate Envoy Todd Stern has recognized the need to increase public finance for adaptation.18 The impacts of climate change are already being felt by communities in developing countries and will increase.  Efforts to date to achieve an increase in international support to adaptation by giving guidance – such as in the FSF decision – on the need for an unquantified „balance‟ with mitigation have failed. As the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Board has recognized, only a quantified commitment to a  balance19 or, better still, a separate target for adaptation will do the job.  The agreement also requires a separate collective goal for mitigation finance. To be credible, any agreement that aspires to catalyse a rapid and large-scale shift to a low-carbon economy must recognize the scale of the challenge. No signals will be sent to the private sector without numbers that identify the scale of the transformation sought. At a minimum, this means recognition of the total investment needs for a pathway consistent with meeting the agreed 2°C goal – let alone the 1.5°C goal rightly demanded by many developing countries – globally and in developing countries, and a commitment to close this gap.  However, while it is challenging to determine exact needs, public finance will have to remain a key component of the climate finance architecture in the new agreement. The setting of a sub-target for public finance for mitigation could be considered, even though such a target would have to be somewhat political and would require regular review on its adequacy and to reflect changing circumstances over time. Also, the exact composition of finance provided and mobilized will depend on national circumstances in recipient countries, and so should be largely determined through the process of agreeing country-by-country financing schedules for both developed and developing countries between 2015 and 2020, to be annexed to the agreement. In this way, the most appropriate and strategic mix of financing tools can be deployed and targeted at unlocking specific low-carbon opportunities in particular countries. This approach is further elaborated in relation to choice C below.  C. Top-down or bottom-up numbers?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  The scale of the Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn agreement was determined essentially on a political basis, although it was influenced to some extent by available top-down scientific or academic estimates of the costs of adaptation and mitigation in developing countries.  Two problems have arisen as a result of this approach. Firstly, the political agreement moved too far away from available top-down studies, so that the resulting scale is significantly lower than what is needed. Only if the $100bn was to come solely from public finance and be solely for adaptation would it approach the order of magnitude indicated by most available top-down studies. The order of magnitude for shifting private finance for mitigation is many times higher than $100bn per year, as assessed in section 2 below.  Secondly, even if political agreement had been reached with closer reference to the evidence available at the time, any approach to establishing the scale of finance needs based on top-down studies is necessarily crude. By their nature, top-down methodologies rely on significant assumptions, which can alter the resulting estimates quite substantially and they change over time as we learn more about the challenges to be faced and overcome.  But perhaps more significantly, framing the finance debate in a global top-down manner has tended to result in negotiations on a somewhat abstract global figure that bears little relation to actual needs and opportunities on the ground. It has produced a negotiating climate in which climate finance is treated more as a negotiating chip in a tit-for-tat deadlock between rich and poor countries than as a practical tool for unlocking concrete action in countries and catalysing an upward spiral of ambition.  Learning from these lessons, Parties might consider alternative options for determining the scale of finance needs to be captured in an agreement, as set out in Table 1C.  Table 1C: Top-down or bottom-up numbers?  Top-down, politically determined  Top-down, science-based  Bottom-up  Hybrid*  Adaptation  E.g. Copenhagen Accord/ Cancun Agreements: a mixed adaptation/ mitigation commitment E.g. Africa Group proposal for a science-based, long-term goal for adaptation finance, linked to temperature targetsE.g. Paris agreement could determine adaptation finance commitments based on National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) See Oxfam’s choice  Mitigation  E.g. Copenhagen Accord/ Cancun Agreements: a mixed adaptation/ mitigation commitment E.g. The Climate Equity Reference Project: proposal for international mitigation finance obligationsE.g. Paris agreement could determine mitigation finance commitments based on Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)22 See Oxfam’s choice  * Collective targets set according to science-based top-down estimates, country action and financing schedules based on bottom-up plans  Oxfam’s choice  Oxfam proposes that the Paris agreement should base the numbers for the collective goal of closing the global finance gap for mitigation, and the collective goal for adaptation finance from public finance, on science-based top-down estimates, of the kind referenced in section 2 of this paper. Alongside this, bottom-up national-level plans to be put forward by developing countries between 2015 and 2020 should form the basis of ongoing negotiations on the country-specific financing schedules suggested above.  This kind of hybrid approach is a means of providing a more accurate sense of the scale of global financial shifts required over the medium term, while also helping to move the finance debate at the UN more firmly towards a constructive dialogue between countries that will unlock specific action on the ground.  Importantly, part of setting a more accurately science-based global public finance goal for adaptation should involve a mechanism whereby lower ambition in the agreement on mitigation should result in higher ambition on adaptation finance. This idea has been proposed by the Africa Group, which calls for an adaptation finance goal based on a scientific assessment of the adaptation costs associated with different rises in temperature.Building bottom-up plans into the identification of financing costs is also an important means of determining the scale of individual entitlements, by ensuring that they reflect to some extent the ambition of plans put forward by developing countries, encouraging a spiral of greater ambition. This approach is further elaborated in relation to choice D below.  Box 1: Defining ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’  For the purpose of this paper, „top-down numbers‟ means a macro (global) analysis based on „big picture‟ trends. Examples include the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve developed by McKinsey & Company.„Bottom-up numbers‟ refers to analysis conducted at the national level to determine costs for a particular country, usually with regard to the specific conditions in that country. These bottom-up numbers may be expressed individually or combined and extrapolated to produce an alternative global figure.  D. Who pays and who receives?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  Under the Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn agreement, „developed countries‟ were due to contribute financial resources and „developing countries‟ were entitled to receive them. No more specific definition was given for these groupings nor, more significantly, was any system of effort sharing established that would determine the relative contributions of individual developed countries or the relative entitlements of individual developing countries.  As a result, and as assessed under choice A above, developed countries have largely been able to evade accountability for any specific share of the $100bn collective target, and no developing country has been able to make plans on the basis of predictable, reliable finance flows.  What is more, establishing who pays and who receives on the basis of categories of developed and developing countries, corresponding de facto to the Annex I/Non-Annex I distinction of the UNFCCC (for the sake of the $100bn commitment) or the Annex II/non-Annex II distinction (for the sake of a legal obligation to provide financial support), has meant that some countries with levels of responsibility and capability comparable to those of developed countries, including Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, have avoided any financial contribution. Instead of increasing the pressure on developed countries to contribute, this lack of an objective basis for determining fair shares has instead allowed these countries to avoid the scale of contributions that should be expected of them. A system in which each developed country determines how much it is prepared to contribute has meant insufficient resources being mobilized overall.  Learning from these lessons, Parties might consider alternative options for determining who pays and who receives climate finance in the post-2020 regime. Some new approaches have started to emerge in the climate regime since Copenhagen. For example, some larger developing countries opted to voluntarily forego receiving any Fast Start Finance, and some developing countries recently opted voluntarily to contribute to the GCF.25 Further new approaches have been proposed, meaning that a variety of options could be considered by Parties, ranging from a complete shift to new, objectively determined equity regimes to more gradual means of encouraging new contributors of finance and prioritized recipients of finance, as set out in Table 1D.1.  Table 1D.1: Who pays and who receives?  Who contributes?  Developed countries only  Developed countries and developing countries voluntarily (‘in a position to do so’)  Developed countries and developing countries through a South–South fund  Developed countries and developing countries according to an equity framework  Who receives?  All developing countries  E.g. Copenhagen Accord/ Cancun Agreements De jure: formerly any developing country was entitled to receive financing  All developing countries, but guidance on which should be prioritized  E.g. Fast Start Finance  Gives guidance that Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Africa should be prioritized See Oxfam’s choice for adaptation  E.g. proposal for a South–South solidarity fundAll developing countries, but some opt out voluntarily  E.g. Fast Start Finance  De facto: some large developing countries opted to forego receiving any financing See Oxfam’s choice for adaptation  See Oxfam’s choice for adaptation See Oxfam’s choice for mitigation  Developing countries that are eligible according to an equity framework  E.g. the model pro-posed in Oxfam‟s 2009 report „Hang Together or Separately‟27 See Oxfam’s choice for mitigation  E.g. the „Mexican proposal‟:28 all countries contribute according to Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDRRC), all countries receive according to CBDRRC, meaning that some countries are net contributors, some are net receivers  Oxfam’s choice  Oxfam proposes that an assessment of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) should be carried out during 2015, to assess their fairness, adequacy and consistency with keeping global temperature increases below 2°C  while maintaining a reasonable chance of keeping warming below 1.5°C. The assessment should be informed by an objectively determined equity reference framework based on indicators showing cumulative responsibility for emissions, capability to act, development need and adaptation need. Since the provision of climate finance is part of the fair share of the global effort for highly capable and highly responsible countries, the equity reference framework can also be used to determine adequate levels of climate finance to be provided, as well as entitlement to receive mitigation and adaptation finance. Against such benchmarks, countries can determine the scale of their contributions and developing countries can determine whether to opt to make contributions and at what scale; whether to opt out from receiving finance; and what level of financing they might reasonably expect to be entitled to receive.Separate equity reference frameworks for determining adequate levels of finance by individual countries should be established with respect to mitigation and adaptation finance, though both should relate to the core principles of the UNFCCC.While the equity reference framework could become part of the Paris agreement and thus give a legal standing for the principles and indicators by which countries would define ambition and fairness, the resulting fair shares of international climate finance to be provided could sit outside of the formal agreement. The equity reference framework should be used to guide the submission of INDCs, as well as their ex ante assessment, which could be led by the UNFCCC secretariat at a planned intercessional workshop in Bonn in June 2015 and recorded in a report from the workshop, for example. Alternatively, assessment could be carried out by civil society and presented to governments at an alternate workshop.  Fair shares of mitigation finance  With regard to mitigation, Parties should determine the fair shares of all countries of the global effort needed to ensure a strong chance of limiting average temperature increases to below the 2°C goal agreed at Copenhagen/Cancun, and to keep open the possibility of limiting it to 1.5°C.These fair shares should be based on indicators of responsibility for emissions and capacity to pay. While different assumptions can certainly be justified, Oxfam maintains that reasonable indicators include a country‟s cumulative emissions since 1990 and the income accruing to its population living above a development threshold, such as $9,000 per annum per capita and weighted progressively thereafter.The resulting fair share of the necessary global emissions reductions for some countries, not least those outlined in Annex I of the UNFCCC, may be too large to deliver through domestic action alone. Those countries will need to deliver a portion of their fair share through international mitigation financing of emissions reductions in developing countries. Conversely, those countries whose fair share of the global mitigation effort is less than the available domestic mitigation potential would be entitled to receive international mitigation finance to deliver additional emissions reductions over and above their fair share.    NOTES  1. Countries whose indicative share of internationally supported emissions reductions is less than 0.1% are not included in this list.  2. We have based the Responsibility and Capability Index on each country‟s cumulative emissions since 1990 and the income accruing to its population living above a development threshold of $9,000 per annum, and weighted progressively thereafter.  3. Brazil is included in the list, though we recognize that it is a marginal case. Further, that owing to a large potential for domestic mitigation, the inclusion of Brazil as a contributor to international mitigation finance may be debated. As stressed, this list is indicative only.  4. The country‟s level of income, and therefore the variety of low-cost mitigation options available to it, has been taken into account in determining an appropriate rate of domestic emissions reductions.  These numbers were prepared with assistance from the Climate Equity Reference Project. Further details, including precise parameters used in the calculation are provided in the endnotes. Fair shares of adaptation finance  With regard to international adaptation finance, Parties should determine which countries should contribute, their respective fair shares and which should be entitled to receive funding, based on indicators of capacity to pay, responsibility for emissions and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Oxfam suggests a four-step process.  Firstly, all countries should be classified according to at least three core indicators related to their capacity to pay for international adaptation needs. Capacity indicators are vital as a first threshold for identifying contributing countries, because no country should be contributing to international adaptation needs when doing so would compromise its potential to reduce poverty at home. Oxfam‟s proposed indicators would create a triple-lock to ensure that this would not happen, as follows: Countries should have per capita income (for those citizens above a $9,000 development threshold) equal to or higher than the lowest ranking country currently expected to contribute to international adaptation finance. We have taken this country to be Bulgaria, which has the lowest per capita income (above the threshold) among EU countries. (While not an Annex II country, Bulgaria‟s membership of the EU and of the developed world, and hence inclusion in the $100bn commitment, means it can reasonably be counted as a contributor, accepting that its contribution will be very small.) Countries should have a Human Development Index (HDI) score in the „high‟ or „very high‟ category. Countries should have the capacity for redistribution sufficient at least to eliminate extreme poverty, for example by imposing a marginal tax rate on citizens who are not poor by rich country standards to close the poverty gap in that country.Secondly, fair shares for the resulting list of countries should be determined according to the same indicators for responsibility and capacity as those suggested for determining fair shares of the global mitigation effort above.  Thirdly, the resulting fair shares should be adjusted to take account of the vulnerability of countries to climate change impacts. This is an important step because countries with comparable levels of responsibility for emissions and capability to pay may nonetheless have quite different levels of vulnerability to climate change themselves.  Finally, the resulting list of potential contributors to international adaptation finance should be separated into current and new contributors. Separate targets should be established for each grouping, and their global fair shares adjusted to reflect their share of their group target. At a minimum, the target for the group of current contributors should be included as the collective public adaptation finance goal in the legal agreement.  The target for new contributors may be determined voluntarily among them, and may be recorded in the new agreement or outside of it, with resources flowing either through the current financial mechanism or through a new South–South fund. However, it is important that the target for new contributors should reflect additional finance over and above what the current contributors are required to pay.  This separation into groups of current and new contributors – albeit with individual fair shares based on global indicators that are applicable to all – is needed to reflect the fact that developed countries have consistently failed to keep their promises to provide scaled-up, adequate, predictable, new and additional financial support to developing countries under the UNFCCC. As a result, any new contributors should not be required to make up the shortfall for declining contributions from developed countries, but rather should mobilize further additional adaptation support for Southern countries.  On this basis, Table 1D.3 outlines indicative, not prescriptive, fair shares of international adaptation finance.    NOTES  1. Countries whose Responsibility and Capacity Index score adjusted for vulnerability is below 0.1% are not included in this list.  2. We have based the Responsibility and Capability Index on each country‟s cumulative emissions since 1990, and the income accruing to its population living above a development threshold of $9,000 per annum and weighted progressively thereafter.  3. The adjustment for vulnerability is performed using data from David Wheeler‟s 2011 study „Quantifying Vulnerability to Climate Change: Implications for Adaptation Assistance‟A detailed description of the calculations behind these indicative numbers is provided in the endnotes.To ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable countries do not lose out as a result of their lower capacity to develop and submit such plans, two further steps are needed. Firstly, the formulation adopted in the Cancun Agreements should be continued, in which LDCs, SIDs and African countries should be prioritized for adaptation financing. Secondly, and as a further incentive to bring forward their plans, the international agreement could include a collective commitment from developed countries to at least match the public resources that these developing countries have themselves allocated to adaptation domestically.36 However, it would need to be clear that this commitment to match-funds represents an absolute minimum from developed countries and would need to be formally increased over time.  E. What counts?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  Under the Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn agreement, little progress was made on establishing clear accounting rules to guide what could and could not be counted as a contribution. The lack of agreed accounting rules has been particularly problematic in three areas: how to define contributions as „new and additional‟; how to account for loans; and how to account for private finance.  The result has been, firstly, that too many countries have sought to redirect or re-label existing official development assistance (ODA) flows, or just to recycle commitments already made in the past. Secondly, some countries have relied extensively on loans, including concessional loans, to make their contributions;  and with no clarity on how they should be accounted for, some have counted the full face value of concessional loans (i.e. including the money that will be paid back to them, rather than just the contribution from the government budget to make the loan concessional). Thirdly, with no agreed means of accounting for private finance flows, countries have been able to use whatever means they choose to claim that private sector financial flows have been „mobilized‟ and can therefore be counted as a contribution. This is dangerous accounting, and renders the $100bn pledge meaningless – as the total could very quickly and easily be reached, crowding out indispensable public funds as a result.  Learning from these lessons, the Parties might consider alternative options for the Paris agreement. These might, for example, provide guidance on the proportion of total contributions that could be made in the form of loans, on how to account for concessional loans and/or on whether and how contributions should be defined as „new and additional‟, as set out in table 1E below.  Table 1E: What counts as a finance contribution?  Grants or loans?  Grants only  Grant equivalents only  Guidance on % as loans  No guidance/limit on loans  New and additional?  No reference to ‘new and additional’  E.g. Copenhagen Accord/Cancun Agreements  Countries provide own definition  E.g. GCF Board decision  E.g. FSF commitment  Not previously announced  Additional to 0.7% target for ODA  E.g. consistent with Denmark and Sweden‟s contribution to FSF  Additional to a base year  Part of ODA budget which is rising at least at same rate  E.g. consistent with Australian contribution to FSF  Oxfam’s choice  Oxfam proposes that, at a minimum, the Paris agreement should provide guidance on the maximum proportion of financial contributions in the form of loans from any one Party towards both adaptation and mitigation; clarifies that  only the grant equivalent of loans should be counted as a contribution (including no loans for adaptation); and clarifies once and for all a definition of „new and additional‟ that will stick.  The GCF Executive Board has already shown the way with regard to limiting the proportion of contributions in the form of loans, and this precedent should now be extended to the finance commitments under the post-2020 regime. As is the practice in accounting for ODA under OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) rules, only the government contribution to make the loan concessional should be counted.  Oxfam, along with many others, has long argued the importance of establishing a clear definition of „new and additional‟, and pointed out the dangers that arise in the absence of such a definition.37 The principle that commitments under the UNFCCC should be accounted for separately from existing commitments to reach 0.7% gross national income (GNI)/ODA (such that climate finance comes on top of ODA commitments and does not displace them) remains the gold standard for considering climate finance to be genuinely new and additional.  However, if this definition cannot be agreed among the Parties to the UNFCCC, as has proved to be the case over the past 20 years, then an alternative should be sought. The bottom line should be that any increase in climate finance must not come at the expense of total ODA spending. If climate finance is accounted for as ODA, it should only be considered new and additional if it is part of a rising overall aid budget and is rising at least at the same rate.  As regards accounting for private finance, while proper guidelines on measuring and reporting are being developed, Oxfam proposes a strict ring-fencing of what can be counted by governments as a public contribution. If public money is used to mobilize private finance, only the public part should be eligible to be counted as a government contribution – not the full face value of the total mobilized investment. Likewise, investments that are mobilized more indirectly through a broader concept of government intervention (such as through setting the right policy frameworks) should not be counted as public finance.  QUALITATIVE COMMITMENTS  F. What commitments to policy action should be captured in Paris?  Learning from the $100bn commitment  The Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn commitment had little if anything to say about additional policy actions committed to by governments to help mobilize and redirect additional financial flows for low-carbon and climate-resilient development. No real qualitative commitments to policy action were made.  This lack of any detail on policy tools available to governments has essentially meant that an opportunity has been missed to secure the deeper changes to the global economy needed, and has served to almost nullify the $100bn goal.  As Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, has noted, the $100bn goal must not be seen as the end point of the fight against climate change, which requires a far more substantial economic and financial transformation, in the order of trillions of dollars: „$100 billion is basically the tail that needs to wag the dog. That $100 billion, the only thing that that is going to do is take the dog and point it in the direction that we must move because we know that the financing we need is not $100 billion per year – it is $1 trillion per year, and that is what needs to be mobilized.‟As a result, Parties might consider alternative qualitative commitments that could be made in the Paris agreement. Options should be considered relating to mobilizing both public and private finance, and at both international and national levels, as set out in Table 1F.1 below.  Table 1F.1: What commitments to policy action should be captured in Paris?  Private finance  Public finance International actions  E.g. Paris agreement could include agreement on new international principles for responsible energy and climate finance; see PRECI proposal in Box 2 below  E.g. Paris agreement could include commitments to establish mechanisms to generate international public finance, such as from bunker fuels, etc. Domestic actions  E.g. Paris agreement could include commitments to remove export credits for coal  E.g. Paris agreement could include commitments to generate additional public finance for climate action (at home for developing countries; partially abroad for developed countries), such as from carbon taxes, financial transaction taxes (FTTs), ending fossil fuel subsidies  Oxfam’s choice  Oxfam proposes that the Paris agreement should include new commitments to policy action – at both national and international levels – that will establish innovative new sources of public climate finance and new principles or standards to govern private finance flows for energy- and climate-related investments.  Oxfam has long campaigned for new and innovative sources of public finance to be established at national and international levels. These mechanisms can both help prevent the alarming shift in ODA to climate finance and give greater reliability and predictability of finance flows to recipient countries.  Since last year, there have been important developments which have revitalized the debate about alternative finance sources. Many countries have put in place new, innovative financing mechanisms at national level. Table 1E.2 below lists some of the leading proposals and where they have been implemented, or how far they have progressed.  The Paris agreement should include an action plan towards establishing the most promising financing mechanisms at national and international levels. Parties should submit their ideas in this regard as part of their submissions of INDCs at the start of 2015. Further progress may be made in the context of the June 2015 Addis Ababa conference on Financing for Development.  Potential $ Innovative sources of public finance that governments can pursue unilaterally, and collect nationally.  Domestic carbon taxes (will be a new source of revenue for national budgets, unless otherwise decided by governments)  Many countries and regions39 have or plan carbon taxes/ETS to raise revenues for national budgets. South Korea plans to recycle ETS revenues for domestic climate action through a dedicated Green FundEU ETS Auction Revenues – including EU aviation scheme (can create a dedicated new revenue stream distinct from national budgets)  Germany, Finland, LithuaniaEU countries reported spending 87% of ETS revenues (€3bn) on climate action at home and abroad last year.Several countries reported spending a percentage on international climate finance for developing countries (e.g. Finland and Denmark 50%; the UK 39% and Germany 30% 43).  But only Germany, Finland and Lithuania have so far enshrined this recycling of revenues in their budgets  EU ETS revenues currently amount to €3.6bn a year, a figure that is expected to increase over the coming years  Redirecting fossil fuel subsidies44 (will be a new source of revenue for national budgets)  UN High Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Finance  There is a G20 commitment to phase out subsidies, and members of the G20 have recognized that this could be a way of mobilizing climate financeOECD members spent $80bn on fossil fuel subsidies in 2011, and the trend is increasingDebt relief, in the form of debt-for-climate swaps  (lender countries unilaterally agree to forego repayment of bilateral loans. May also be established for multilateral debt.)  UNDP  The US wrote off some debt as a small part of its FSF pledge  About $30bn a year. During the FSF period, payments by developing countries to service long-term debt amounted to triple the FSF promised  Innovative sources of public finance dependent on international agreement and collected nationally  Internationally coordinated Financial Transaction Taxes (FTTs)  (may also be established unilaterally)  France  The French FTT raises around €700m a year, of which 10% is allocated to international climate finance and global health49,  Approximately €35m a year from France alone  Carbon pricing for international aviation  (applied either by a carbon charge or auctioning in an ETS)  EULDC GroupThe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Assembly committed in October 2013 to develop a global market-based mechanism addressing international aviation emissions by 2016 and to apply it by 2020  Carbon pricing for international shipping  (applied either via a fuel levy or auctioning in an ETS)  EU  LDC Group  Progress on market-based mechanisms has stalled over the past year – a non-revenue-raising efficiency standard has been taken forward insteadDaly-Correa tax(a tax on every barrel of oil exported to rich countries, collected by OPEC governments from importing country governments, and channelled to the Green Climate Fund)  Proposed by Ecuador at Doha  Still a proposal. Idea was discussed at last year‟s OPEC meeting  A 3–5% tax could raise up to $80bn a year. The original idea was to replace other carbon pricing systems  ‘Carbon majors’ levy on fossil fuel extraction  (applied via a levy collected by governments from oil/gas/coal companies and channelled to a global loss and damage mechanism)  A new proposal  No, though a similar levy exists to raise money for an international oil spill insurance mechanism  Charging the 90 biggest fossil fuel companies a levy of $2 per tonne CO2e that they are responsible for would raise over $50bn a yearNew commitments should also be made with regard to shifting private finance. At the national level, developed countries can help steer international private investment flows, for example through reform of rules for export credit agencies to exclude public financing for coal projects, and requiring financial actors to be transparent about the scale, nature and impacts of their investments in „dirty‟ energy.  Public regulation in all countries can help channel foreign direct investment (FDI) to support, not hinder, their domestic mitigation and adaptation priorities. This involves creating an attractive environment for investment and could include legislating to set targets to phase out coal or introduce feed-in tariffs or quotas for renewable energy; and phasing out fossil fuels subsidies, sensitively and strategically, and ensuring that protections are in place for the poorest people.International actions should also be agreed, such as an agreement on principles for responsible energy and climate finance (see Box 2). This would act as a code of conduct for all private investment, and would be strictly applied to private  investment mobilized as part of national financing schedules, i.e. investment that is backed by public support. Adherence to social and environmental standards should be a precondition for any public support to the private sector.  Box 2: Oxfam's proposal for the Paris Principles for Responsible Energy and Climate Investment (PRECI)  These principles should be developed at international level through an inclusive, gendered, multi-stakeholder process, with governments, civil society and the private sector all at the table. This would allow developing country governments and civil society to have a say in how private investment is directed in their countries. There are precedents for this: the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land agreed under the Committee on World Food Security CFS in Rome and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights both followed similar processes to agree principles. The process could be launched in Lima and concluded in Paris, or launched in Paris and concluded a year or two later.  Suggested principles  1. Ensure consistency with the goals of poverty eradication and sustainable development.  2. Implement social and environmental safeguards in line with national regulations and international best practice (if different, whichever is the higher), in order to avoid negative impacts such as, inter alia, land grabbing, human rights violations, biodiversity degradation, tax avoidance, etc. These include international benchmarks such as Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), the OECD Guidelines and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  3. Ensure that financing is transparent and accountable (e.g. not channelled through tax havens and with clear beneficial ownership and revenue transparency).  4. Implement an exclusion list of projects that cannot be supported. This includes both direct and indirect financing of harmful fossil fuel projects in developing countries which do not meet social and environmental safeguards, lack robust impact assessments, are incompatible with a country‟s trajectory for its fair share of emissions reductions or where pro-poor alternatives exist.  5. Assess and report on the potential lifetime cost and the scale and distribution of risk of all investments, to ensure fairness and to ensure that the receiving country and its population do not end up incurring additional unforeseen costs.  Pulling it all together: Finance in the Paris agreement: visualizing Oxfam’s key recommendations  2 THE NUMBERS  As discussed in section 1 under choice C, there have been significant shortcomings in basing the scale of the Copenhagen/Cancun $100bn commitment on largely politically determined, top-down estimates of need. Oxfam proposes that the quantitative commitments under the post-2020 regime should instead be based on a mix of top-down science-based estimates and bottom-up country-specific plans – the former guiding the collective goals included in the international agreement, and the latter guiding the scale of finance provided in the context of developed countries‟ national financing schedules.  This section assesses the potential orders of magnitude – the numbers – that should be reflected in the international agreement, and that might be needed in the context of national action and financing schedules.  A. MITIGATION  Order of magnitude of a collective mitigation finance goal  Estimating international mitigation finance needs presents a range of questions and methodological challenges. As discussed in Box 3 below, a first challenge is to identify an appropriate metric for assessing mitigation finance needs. In preparing this paper, Oxfam commissioned the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) to compile and assess existing estimates of the investment required to move to a 2°C trajectory.56 This review focuses on the following four studies: McCollum et al. (2013), which presents results from five separate modelling teams, all included in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report; The Global Energy Assessment, which presents the MESSAGE model results of Riahi et al. (2012) (GEA, 2012, Chapter 17), included in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report; The International Energy Agency (IEA)‟s 2012 „Energy Technology Perspectives‟ report (IEA, 2012), not included in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report; and The IEA‟s 2014 „World Energy Investment Outlook‟ (IEA, 2014), not included in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which elaborates on the investment requirements associated with the scenarios presented in the IEA‟s 2013 World Energy Outlook.  Box 3: What should we be measuring?  An initial challenge in estimating total financing needs is the profusion of different metrics and concepts used across relevant studies. Parties should consider three sets of choices in determining which is most appropriate for reference in a post-2020 agreement.  Incremental versus total investment  Incremental investments reflect the total capital investment minus investment under a business-as-usual scenario. As such, they are indicative of the additional effort required and relate to the provisions of the UNFCCC requiring „agreed incremental costs‟ of low-carbon action in developing countries to be supported. However, in practice it has been extremely difficult to prove what level of investment would have occurred in the absence of climate policy interventions. Total climate mitigation-specific investments, by contrast, are much easier to measure and assess.  Climate-specific versus net climate-relevant investments  Another consideration is whether to focus on gross climate-specific (or mitigation-specific or adaptation-specific) investments, notably in renewable energy and energy efficiency, or net climate-relevant investments, which attempt to account for the avoided investment in fossil fuels. While the latter may more accurately reflect the ultimate costs to the economy, it is questionable whether the savings from avoided investments will always be redirected towards low-carbon options. For example, it is quite unlikely that reduced investments in upstream fossil fuel supply will lead to increased investment in renewable energy supply, as the investors and products may differ substantially.  Total costs over time versus upfront investments  Incremental costs account for differences in operational and fuel expenditures, in addition to incremental upfront investments. Again, while incremental costs may better reflect the benefits that accrue in a low-carbon future (with incremental costs generally considerably lower than investments, reflecting significant fuel savings in switching from fossils to renewables), it is questionable to what extent these savings will flow to climate mitigation-specific investments. What is more, these savings do not alter the amount of investment capital required in meeting the global mitigation challenge, the mobilization of which poses an additional effort to be made in its own right, consisting of efforts to overcome financial, technological, political and societal barriers. It is towards this additional effort that developing countries are entitled to receive support from developed countries in a system of equitably sharing the global effort to fight climate change.  Here we look in more detail at existing estimates of total investment needs specific to climate mitigation consistent with avoiding 2°C of warming – and the gap between these projected needs and current total climate mitigation-specific investment – on the basis that this is the metric that could most easily be used as a yardstick for assessing progress at the UNFCCC.  Table 2.1 shows the results of the eight models included in the four studies above, suggesting that total climate mitigation-specific investment needs range from $363bn to $2.4 trillion over the next 20–30 years. Not shown in the table is total required investments in the forestry sector, which the World Economic Forum (2013) estimates at $104bn per year.    1. Emissions reductions are for fossil fuel and industry CO2 only.  2. Low-carbon power includes nuclear, renewable, and fossil fuel power plants with CCS (although it is not possible to separate CCS from fossil fuel power in second MESSAGE study above). All other fossil fuel power plant investment is excluded.  3. This column represents demand-side efficiency investments. For WEIO, this column also includes electric vehicles. Efficiency investments estimates are often available only on an incremental basis rather than total.  4 Studies differ widely in how they consider, categorize, and report other investment types. Other, climate-specific investment may include some combination of biofuels, uranium extraction, and R&D investments.  By comparing these levels with estimated current total climate mitigation-specific investments, the substantial financing gap becomes obvious. The most comprehensive study of current investment flows, produced by the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), estimates the annual investment for climate mitigation at $337bn for 2012. 57 Out of the total 2012 climate finance flow for both mitigation and adaptation, the vast majority (94 per cent) targeted mitigation activities, originated in the country where investment occurred (76 per cent), flowed from the private sector (62 per cent) and funded non-fossil fuel power generation (74 per cent).  CPI estimates total North–South flows for mitigation, including private finance, at $40bn.To estimate current total climate mitigation-specific investments, we take the total mitigation figure from CPI (US$337bn). However, CPI reports only public, not private, investment in energy efficiency – US$32bn. So we swap in the IEA (2014b) estimate for energy efficiency investments in 2013, including both public and private, at US$130bn, to provide a more comprehensive picture of current financing. Thus we estimate total current annual climate-specific investment in mitigation at about US$435bn.  Table 2.2 below compares the most recent estimated current investment flows from both the CPI and IEA, with projections of investment needs for a 2ºC-consistent pathway.    1. As discussed above, we use two sources to estimate current investment. We draw low-carbon power and forestry and other investment flows from Buchner et al. (2013), representing data from 2011 and 2012. We draw incremental efficiency investment from IEA (2014b), based on 2013 data.  2. All efficiency investment projections are reported as incremental investment needs, due to the limitations of total investments discussed in the SEI discussion brief.  3. Current investment reflects a combination of biofuels and other mitigation measures categories of Buchner et al. (2013). Projected investments combines the World Economic Forum (2013) estimate for forestry investment needs ($104bn per year) with estimates for total other, climate-specific investment from Table 2.1.  4. Combined, climate-specific represent the sum of the three columns shown. The ranges show the highest and lowest sums across the 8 scenarios analysed here. The values in the ranges shown do  not necessarily match the sum of the values in the ranges for the three columns to the left. For example, the high end of the range for projected average annual investment needs ($1195bn) represents the WITCH model findings (plus forestry), while the high end of the range for incremental efficiency ($520bn per year) is drawn from the ETP study.  On this basis, Parties might conclude that the post-2020 climate regime should aim to mobilize additional climate mitigation-specific investments in the order of several hundred billion dollars, and possibly half a trillion dollars, per year over the next 15–20 years.  Unpacking the regional breakdown of these investments, it is clear that the majority are needed in developing countries. Table 2.4 shows the potential scale of the financing gap in non-OECD countries according to the CPI estimates on current flows and IEA estimates of needed flows, representing over 60 per cent of the global total.    1. Current non-OECD investment is taken from Buchner et al. (2013), who, as noted above, do not account for private energy efficiency investments. The IEA (2014b) does not separately report non-OECD current investment.  2. Projected forestry investment needs are taken from WEF (2013), assigning total investment needs to non-OECD countries (US$104 billion/year). The remainder ($16 billion/year) are biofuels-related investment needs taken from IEA (2014b).  Meeting these investment needs in developing countries is key to unlocking ambition in the post-2020 climate regime. To achieve such an outcome, climate-specific investments must increase substantially, particularly in the form of North-South transfers. While for the complete picture total climate-specific investment needs need to be looked at and are also more straightforward to measure and track (except for energy efficiency), it is the incremental investment flows in climate-specific investment is what new and additional policies, actions, and funding must spur.  Encouraging greater investment – and critically, the appropriate balance of public and private instruments to do so – depends on a much more detailed understanding of financing needs in individual developing country contexts. For this reason, it is vital that the post-2020 regime bases commitments to provide and mobilise finance relating to supporting mitigation in developing countries as  far as possible on bottom-up country-specific assessments.  Order of magnitude in national financing needs  From the global studies, developing country investment projections are available only at the country level in IEA studies, and only for China, India and Brazil (IEA, 2014). Outside of these country-level estimates, any developing country estimates are rolled into wider regional estimates, as Table 2.4 shows.  Table 2.4: Country and regional annual average investment needs (USD2010), for climate-specific (total low-carbon power and biofuels, incremental efficiency) investments.  All estimates are from IEA 2014b. Does not include forestry investments as the WEF figure is not broken down by country.    Few if any directly comparable bottom-up estimates of national mitigation financing needs are currently available from which to draw conclusions about the scale of potential financing needs from a bottom-up perspective that could form the basis for national financing schedules underpinning developing country contributions in the new agreement.  Olbrisch et al. (2011) compiled a list of such studies, shown in Table 2.5, for a handful of countries.59 Note that the projections for China and India are broadly consistent with the IEA (2014) projections.    Oxfam commissioned a review of current and potential or planned future investments and needs for low-carbon development in a range of developing countries.60 The findings have their limitations due to different methodologies, scope and completeness of estimates reviewed, but they offer a snapshot of needs and of the concrete low-carbon action that meeting them could unlock.  Box 4: Examples of financing needs in different countries  South Africa: The National Climate Change Response Paper (NCCRP) is the basis for climate action in South Africa, covering areas such as renewable energies, energy efficiency and transport. The financing gap identified in the NCCRP amounts to $30bn in the transport sector and at least $45bn in the energy sector. There are plans to add 17.8GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, with 3.7GW in added capacity already under way, with investments totalling $12bn.  Ethiopia: The Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) for the 2015–20 period aims at both climate-resilient and low-carbon development, inter alia expanding electricity generation from renewable energies for both domestic and regional use, leap-frogging to energy-efficient technologies and protecting and re-establishing forests and their economic and ecosystem services, including as carbon stocks. Current annual spending by the Ethiopian government on environment and climate initiatives is $7.5bn. An estimated $50bn in total investments and operational costs will be needed over the next five years to implement the Green Economy Strategy alone (the cost of translating the Climate Resilient Strategy into practice has not been yet quantified) , with half of that amount required from financial actors outside the country.  Peru: Mitigation action is based on the Planning for Climate Change Action (PlanCC) that identifies 77 actions under several mitigation scenarios through to 2050. Under the Sustainable Scenario, where Peru would halve their emissions by 2050 compared to a BAU baseline, a total initial capital investment of 54bn Soles (approx $18bn) would be needed for actions in the energy sector, focusing on renewable energies, and in the transport sector. Actions are underway, with 550MW of renewable energy projects reaching financial closure in 2012, worth $1.1bn.  Indonesia: The basis for mitigation action through to 2029 is the Indonesian Climate Change Sectoral Roadmap (ICCSR). It covers sectors such as energy, industry, transport, forestry and waste and a range of sectors relevant to adaptation. It also aims to provide policy guidance to reach the country‟s pledge in Cancun to cut emissions by 26 per cent below the 2020 business-as-usual baseline and by up to 41 per cent subject to the availability of international support. The ICCSR puts the financing gap at $68.6bn for actions listed, with most of it (around $63bn) in the energy sector.  One conclusion to draw from this review is that few if any countries have yet identified their specific financing needs. Also, there is little clarity on the amounts of public finance needed to trigger additional private flows alongside the effect that national policy and climate legislation could have. Eventually, the exact nature of levels, types, instruments and channels of finance can only be accurately determined through bottom-up assessments at the national level.  Indeed, while low-carbon policy planning has advanced considerably in recent years in many countries, not least those reviewed for Oxfam, identification of strategic financing needs for those policies continues to lag some way behind. A further process, such as that proposed in this paper, to develop national financing schedules in the context of the new agreement will help to address this.  Oxfam's choice of mitigation finance numbers  Oxfam proposes that the legally binding international agreement should include: A collective recognition that the order of magnitude of the gap between current total climate mitigation-specific investments and estimated needs for a 2°C pathway is in the order of several hundred billion US dollars per year over the next 15–20 years, and may be greater than half a trillion US dollars per year; A collective recognition that the majority of the investments to close this gap are needed in non-OECD developing countries and that, while national climate action in non-OECD developing countries will play its role in shifting financial flows, international climate finance will remain crucial; Provisions for countries which are eligible to receive international mitigation finance to bring forward national financing plans between 2015 and 2020, detailing the proportion that they are able to fund domestically and the scale of their remaining needs for international mitigation finance support from a mix of public and private finance; A commitment from countries which are required to contribute to international mitigation finance as part of their fair share of the global mitigation effort. The details of this commitment would be worked out initially between 2015 and 2020 and then continued in an iterative manner from 2020 onwards, in countries‟ national climate financing schedules on an ongoing basis.  B. ADAPTATION  Order of magnitude of a collective public adaptation finance goal  A range of top-down estimates of adaptation finance needs have been developed over the past 5–10 years, employing a variety of methodologies. On this basis, the widely recognized order of magnitude of global needs for public adaptation finance is in the order of at least $100bn per annum through to the middle of the century.One important lesson from the most recent top-down and long-term estimates is the sensitivity of the scale of adaptation costs to the level of global mitigation ambition. One of the most recent and comprehensive studies, published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), projects annual adaptation costs for developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa alone at $67bn per year by the 2050s under a scenario consistent with limiting temperature increases to below 2ºC, and $110bn under a scenario consistent with temperature increases of over 3.5ºC. Under a scenario consistent with a temperature increase of over 4ºC, costs may reach $180bn per year by the 2050s, and will continue to increase into hundreds of billions of dollars under all scenarios in the second half of the century.62 For this reason, any collective adaptation finance goal included in the international agreement must be linked to the level of mitigation ambition contained in the agreement, as currently proposed by the Africa Group.There is undoubtedly a significant funding gap between costs of this order of magnitude and current financial flows for adaptation. Oxfam estimates that  current annual adaptation spending in sub-Saharan Africa – including both domestic resources committed by governments themselves and international climate finance flows – amounts to approximately $6.49bn.64 This would mean that the post-2020 international agreement should aim to scale up annual adaptation financing to sub-Saharan African countries by an additional $62bn under an agreement with a good chance of limiting emissions to 2ºC, and by $105bn under an agreement entailing a risk of exceeding 3.5ºC.  This is just for developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, however. Other vulnerable countries, especially SIDs and LDCs outside of Africa will rightly expect adaptation funding.  However, it is important to recognize that all such top-down methodologies face challenges, relying on a range of assumptions that can generate significant uncertainties in results. As the World Bank notes, „calculating the global cost of adaptation remains a complex problem, requiring projections of economic growth, structural change, climate change, human behaviour, and government investments 40 years in the future... [with] important assumptions and simplifications, to some degree biasing the estimates‟.As a result, even the most sophisticated estimates seem increasingly out of step with costs being identified in countries from a bottom-up perspective, as discussed in Box 5.  Box 5: Current top-down adaptation cost estimates do not match realities in countries  One of the most recent and detailed top-down estimates of the cost of adaptation in Africa, based on the AD-RICE Integrated Assessment Model, projects that annual needs in developing countries across sub-Saharan African up to the 2020s amount to approximately 0.44% of GDP,66 or currently approximately $88.14m in Uganda and $188.34m in Ethiopia.  An alternative top-down approach from the World Bank suggests that average costs across sub-Saharan Africa for 2010–19 will be approximately 0.6–0.7% of GDP,67 or currently approximately $130.20m in Uganda and $278.34m in Ethiopia.  Yet these top-down estimates are out of step with nationally specific assessments from the bottom up in these two countries, both of which have taken proactive steps to plan for climate change. In Uganda the climate change policy includes a costed implementation plan. This puts the additional cost of adaptation at over $3.8bn over 15 years, or $258m a year – at least twice as high as the top-down estimates.The Ethiopian case is even more striking. The cost of implementing Ethiopia‟s Climate-Resilient Green Economy strategy tops $7.5bn annually.69 The strategy does not disaggregate between adaptation and mitigation; however, a separate study estimates the cost to be between $0.8bn and $2.8bn annually.70 The World Bank‟s own bottom-up estimate of adaptation costs in Ethiopia suggests that between $1.22bn and $5.84bn is needed.What is more, these bottom-up estimates seem to be borne out by the levels of domestic spending committed to adaptation by developing country governments themselves. Oxfam estimates that in  the Ethiopian government invested $306m of its own domestic resources in adaptation – significantly higher than the top-down estimates of need.Ethiopia is not alone in investing a significant share of its domestic resources to address climate change adaptation needs. Oxfam estimates that the Philippines and Nepal invested $539m and $91.4m respectively in 2012, well above the scale of needs suggested by the top-down estimates for those countries. Bangladesh estimates that it spends over 1% of GDP on climate change measures, 90% of which is for adaptation.Since it is highly unlikely that developing country governments with stretched budgets would over-spend on adapting to climate change, these figures demonstrate the shortcomings of even the most sophisticated top-down models.  Table 2.6: Adaptation cost estimates for Uganda and Ethiopia Country Top-down estimate (UNEP) Top-down estimate (World Bank) Bottom-up national estimate ($) Estimated current government spending ($) Uganda $88.14m $130.2m $258m $18.09m Ethiopia $188.34m $278.34m $1,220m–$5,840m $306.25m  For this reason, it is vital that the post-2020 regime bases quantitative commitments to adaptation support as far as possible on bottom-up, country-specific assessments.  Order of magnitude in national action and financing schedules  As the examples from Uganda and Ethiopia demonstrate, where robust national-level adaptation cost estimates have been produced, the orders of magnitude can be significantly higher than top-down models project. What is equally clear is that developing country governments are not simply waiting for international funds to arrive, but are urgently investing already from their own stretched budgets.  Under the Cancun Agreements, Parties have embarked on developing National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), which offer a potential vehicle for developing estimates of total financing needs, including the scale of funds that might be invested from domestic budgets and the remaining scale of funds needed from international sources.  Because NAPs (and costs) are at various stages of development, it is very difficult to estimate total needs for international adaptation finance flows. However, drawing on a proposal by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI),74 a reasonable approach may be to suggest that in the absence of detailed bottom-up financial needs assessments, in Paris developed countries should commit initially and as a bare minimum to at least match domestic adaptation spending levels by developing country governments. There would need to be agreement to revise this over time as top down numbers became available.  On the basis of estimates of current adaptation spending from domestic budgets in four sub-Saharan African countries, Oxfam estimates that this could entail a minimum commitment of approximately $45.2bn for countries in this region alone.75 Additional resources would rightly be expected from other countries considered highly vulnerable to climate impacts.  Oxfam’s choice of adaptation finance numbers  Oxfam proposes that the legally binding international agreement should include: A collective recognition of the order of magnitude of the adaptation finance gap, consistent with the level of ambition in the agreement. For example, a 2ºC-consistent agreement should note that by 2050 at least an additional $60bn is needed per annum for sub-Saharan Africa alone (with further resources for other countries); and a 3.5ºC-consistent agreement should note that by 2050 at least an additional $100bn is needed per annum for sub-Saharan Africa alone (with further resources for other countries); A commitment from countries that are eligible to receive international adaptation finance to put forward national adaptation financing plans between 2015 and 2020, detailing the proportion that they are able to fund domestically and their remaining needs for international adaptation finance support; A commitment from countries that are required to contribute to international adaptation finance to scale up resources for adaptation through the GCF to a near-term figure consistent with the recognized global adaptation finance gap. For example, in a 2ºC-consistent agreement, this could amount to at least $15–20bn by 2025; in a 3.5ºC-consistent agreement, it could amount to at least $20–25bn by 2025;76 A commitment from countries that are required to contribute to international adaptation finance to regularly assess national adaptation financing plans, with the aim of bridging the identified remaining needs for international adaptation finance, and a minimum commitment to match domestic spending levels by recipient countries. This minimum commitment would likely amount currently to approximately $4–5bn per year in bilateral support to countries in sub-Saharan Africa alone (with further resources needed for other countries).  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Together Parties can break the current stand-off over climate finance and forge an agreement that sets in motion the wave of investment and cooperation needed to meet the global mitigation challenge and guarantee support for adaptation.  But success hinges on making the right choices. While there may be no one ideal solution and some compromises may be necessary, the finance element of the Paris agreement must have certain features.  1. Recognition of the scale of the investment gap and a shared commitment to closing it  No strategy for change is credible unless it is costed. Furthermore, asking developing countries to commit to strong action without a quantitative commitment of support is unrealistic.  2. A system of individual contributions and entitlements captured alongside the agreement  Contributors may face constitutional barriers to making multi-year commitments, and few developing countries have yet identified their individual financing needs. However, a system of dynamic country-by-country financing schedules annexed to the agreement can circumvent these constraints, provide the necessary predictability, identify opportunities and continually build cooperation and collaboration between contributors and recipients.  3. A separate collective target for public finance for adaptation  Experience to date has clearly demonstrated that only a separate public finance target for adaptation is likely to close the adaptation finance gap.  4. Both top-down and bottom-up methods  The collective commitment must be firmly grounded in the science. And if ambition on mitigation is too low, this must trigger greater support for adaptation. Bottom-up national-level plans, put forward between 2015 and 2020, are needed to identify opportunities, inform negotiations on financing schedules and drive an upward spiral of greater ambition.  5. A fair shares system  Without guidance on how much countries should contribute or what they are entitled to receive, there is little prospect of real progress. Separate frameworks should be established for mitigation and adaptation, both based on the principles of the UNFCCC.  6. Robust accounting  At a minimum, this means limiting the proportion of finance provided as loans, counting only the grant equivalent of loans and finding a definition of „new and additional‟ that will stick.  7. New commitments to establishing innovative sources of public finance  There can be no more shift in current ODA flows to climate finance, and greater reliability and predictability are needed. Put simply, new sources of public finance are needed and Parties must make an action plan aimed at getting the most promising national and international schemes off the ground.  8. New commitments to shifting private finance  Far more can and must be done to help channel private investment. Parties should capture in the Paris agreement the principles, commitments and safeguards necessary to unleash investment in equitable low-carbon solutions.  "

To this end the  organization is engaged in programs working to address climate change, both by  building resilience and by limiting the concentration of greenhouse gasses in the  atmosphere with a target of limiting global temperature rise to no more than  1.5oC. At the same time Oxfam also has programming focused on ensuring  countries with natural resources (including fossil fuel reserves) use those  resources to address poverty and drive development.  These three program efforts together present conflicts as well as synergies. On  the one hand it is clear that advocating for the exploitation of fossil fuel reserves  as a means to fund development will, at some point, come into conflict with  efforts to limit the emission of greenhouse gases. At the same time, the revenues  available from the exploitation of fossil fuels could be used to fund both  adaptation to climate change, as well as the shift towards renewables and a zero  carbon economy.  Oxfam’s unique set of priorities have caused it to reflect on how to resolve these  contradictions and capitalize on the synergies. An outcome of this process was  the realization that while international agreements on climate change placed a  significant focus on ideas of equity and fairness (mainly through the notion of  common but differentiated responsibilities), such a framing was almost  completely lacking when considering the issue of which countries should bear the  greatest burden of having their assets stranded.  In response, Oxfam America’s Extractive Industries team decided to consult with  a political philosopher to explore whether the equity concerns that dominate  international climate change discussions might have relevance to the question of  stranded assets. The result is this paper, which notes that equity concerns on  stranded assets are relevant, yet they are not prominently discussed and there is  little to no research on the topic.  When reading this paper, it should be noted that the intention in publishing it is  not to advocate for a policy position, or motivate for a particular campaign  strategy. Instead the hope is that this work could serve to initiate some  conversation on how to address the challenging question of balancing meeting  development imperatives, managing extractive industries, minimizing climate  change, and adapting to its impacts.  7 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The findings of the paper are as follows:  First, there are inescapable equity issues surrounding the stranding of fossil fuel  assets. Such issues raise unavoidable questions, including:   Whose fossil fuels are to be left in the ground?   What criteria should we employ to decide who has the best case for using  the fossil fuels that may be used?   Is compensation owed to those who leave their fossil fuels in the ground?  If so, who pays?  In addition, the equity issues that arise can be approached from within the  framework that affirms the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility  and Respective Capabilities. In short, this paper confirms the “hypothesis that  there are equity concerns regarding stranded assets which are currently not  accounted for in climate negotiations, but which could reasonably fall within the  logic of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”Second, while there is an extensive literature on the equitable distribution of the  burdens of combating climate change and the equitable transition to a low carbon  world, these have focused overwhelmingly on consumption of fossil fuels and the  emission of greenhouse gases (and not on the production and sale of those fossil  fuels). Similarly, while there is a large literature on stranded fossil fuel assets this  focuses more on the implications for investors and on the economic implications  of stranded assets, and does not discuss the issues of equity and fairness that  arise. Furthermore, while there is valuable work on extractive industries and  natural resources, this is not primarily focused on the specific case of limiting the  use of coal, oil, and gas because of their effects on the climate system and the  ethical issues arising from that. Finally, while there are detailed analyses of  decarbonization and development these also do not examine the equity issues.  In short, then, there has been little “work to date which has explored the  proposed means to account for these equity issues around the stranding of  assets.”That said, the literature on the equitable response to climate change does—in  conjunction with the other literatures mentioned—provide a useful framework by  which to analyses the equity issues surrounding the stranding of assets. So,  even though ethical analyze have not thus far been applied to the stranding of  1 The ‘Research Scope of Work,’ p.2.  2 The ‘Research Scope of Work,’ p.2.  8 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  fossil fuel assets it is possible to do so, and that is what this paper has sought to  do.  Third, there has been little “commentary on the merits of different  decarbonization tools in terms of their capacity to account for the potential equity  implications of stranded assets.”  There has been considerable discussion of the Yasuní-ITT Initiative and the  problems it encountered. Lessons can be learned from this on how to implement  similar initiatives in the future (for example, ensuring that there is a reliable  stream of revenue). However, the focus of that research has not been directly on  the equity implications of the Initiative.  Fourth, the paper has examined the following question: What would likely be  entailed in undertaking an assessment which sought to prioritize the order in  which countries should have their assets stranded (HDI, historical emissions,  carbon intensity of the economy, available resources, climate vulnerability,  governance structures (for delivery of services), etc.)?  In reply: it has found that an assessment which sought to prioritize the order in  which countries should have their assets stranded should be informed by:  a) Its level of development as reflected in its HDI,  b) Its historical responsibility defined in terms of past extraction and past  benefits from extraction, and  c) The availability of resources and forms of energy and sources of  development.  Other considerations cited—carbon intensity, climate vulnerability, and  governance structures—while important, do not in themselves determine an  equitable distribution of claims to extract fossil fuels.Fifth, the paper has examined the following question: What would be the  implications of an equity approach to stranding assets on the idea of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities? Of particular interest is  whether such an approach to stranding assets further explodes the binary  classification of developed vs. developing nations in common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities.In doing so, it found that an equity approach to stranding assets would  undermine the binary classification of countries as either developed or not  developed and would call for a more nuanced framework in which countries  would be placed on a continuum.    9 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  Sixth and finally, the paper has addressed the question: Would raising questions  around equity and stranded assets generate major political risks to the UNFCCC  process?It found that raising questions about equity and stranded assets might encounter  resistance from developed countries which have fossil fuel reserves; and that  moving away from a binary classification and differentiating between different  developing countries might encounter resistance from some developing  countries. However, it also noted ways in which these obstacles can be  addressed and that a process for stranding fossil fuel assets could be designed  in ways that share some features with existing programs like REDD and the  CDM. So the political feasibility problems are not insuperable.  5 The ‘Research Scope of Work,’ p.3.  10 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  INTRODUCTION  Preventing dangerous climate change will require that many fossil fuels—oil, coal  and gas—should not be used, and should instead be left in the ground.6 The  creation of such “stranded assets” raises questions of equity: Who may use the  remaining fossil fuels? What would be the fairest allocation of the opportunity to  extract these fossil fuels? What criteria should be employed to answer this  question? And, what, if anything, is owed to those who are required to leave their  fossil fuels unused?  The objective of this research is to identify and evaluate the ethical issues  surrounding stranded fossil fuel assets. It works on the “hypothesis that there are  equity concerns regarding stranded assets which are currently not accounted for  in climate negotiations, but which could reasonably fall within the logic of  common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”7 With this  in mind, it provides an overview of the literatures on equity and climate change  and their application to these issues.  The paper has the following structure. It is divided into two parts. Part 1 provides  a necessary framework and sets out the questions to be examined and methods  to be employed. This includes a necessary overview of the empirical background  and the context; the setting out of the questions to be examined; and the  outlining of the normative and conceptual framework that underpin the analysis.  Finally, Part 1 closes by setting out the kinds of methods and literature to be  employed.  Having defined the questions, concepts, and methods to be employed, Part 2  engages in the substantive analysis. It examines why, and to what extent,  stranded carbon assets give rise to questions of equity. It further explores the  criteria that might be used to determine who has the best claim to existing fossil  fuel reserves, evaluating six criteria. The work then analyzes the implications of  an equitable treatment of existing fossil fuel reserves, and closes by considering  the political risks of focusing on the equitable distribution of fossil fuels.  6 Note this rests on the assumption that there will not be large-scale deployment of Carbon Capture and  Storage (CCS), at least not in the immediate future. Were there to be extensive CCS then the case for  leaving fossil fuels in the ground would be weakened. For a recent overview of the state of play with regards  to CCS see the discussion in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report by  Thomas Bruckner and Igor Alexeyevich Bashmakov (2014, pp.517 & 532-533). See also McGlade and Ekins’  finding that “the reserves of coal that can be burned are only six percentage points higher when CCS is  allowed, with the utilization of gas and oil increasing by an even smaller fraction (around two percentage  points). Because of the expense of CCS, its relatively late date of introduction (2025), and the assumed  maximum rate at which it can be built, CCS has a relatively modest effect on the overall levels of fossil fuel  that can be produced before 2050 in a 2°C scenario” (McGlade and Ekins 2015, p.190).  7 This is quoted from p.2 of the ‘Research Scope of Work’  11 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  THE CONTEXT  To explore the equity implications of the use of remaining fossil fuels, it is  essential to provide some context. This section thus sets out that context. The  starting point of the analysis is that there is an imperative to prevent “dangerous  anthropogenic interference with the climate system” (United Nations’ Framework  Convention on Climate Change, Article 2).8 This commitment to preventing  dangerous climate change has often been defined in terms of ensuring that  global mean temperatures do not rise by more than 2°C (3.6 Fahrenheit) over  pre-industrial times (although see below for recent developments). Although this  2°C target has been widely endorsed by policymakers, and so estimates for  allocating greenhouse gas emissions have often been based on this figure, it  should be noted that Oxfam has endorsed a commitment to keeping any global  average temperature rise below 1.5°C.  Meeting the 2°C target (and certainly meeting the 1.5°C target) requires a  considerable reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases and the move to a  less intensive carbon society. The magnitude of the challenge is evident from the  Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC). Chapter 12 of the Fifth Assessment Report reports that  “To limit the warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions alone to  be likely less than 2°C relative to the period 1861-1880, total CO2  emissions from all anthropogenic sources would need to be limited to a  cumulative budget of about 1000 PgC since that period. About half [4to 585 PgC] of this budget was already emitted by 2011” (Collins and  Knutti 2013, p.1033).On current trajectories this means that humanity will emit the total “cumulative  budget” by 2040, thereby committing us, within the next 25 years, to a more than  50% chance of a 2°C increase in global mean temperatures over pre-industrial  times.It is salutary to observe that this projection focuses solely on carbon dioxide. If  other greenhouse gases are included then the situation is even more serious.  The passage from the Fifth Assessment Report quoted above continues:  “Accounting for projected warming effect of non-CO2 forcing, a possible release  of GHGs from permafrost or methane hydrates, or requiring a higher likelihood of      12 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  temperatures remaining below 2°C, all imply a lower budget” (Collins and Knutti  2013, p.1033).11 In other words, if we include all greenhouse gases then the  “cumulative budget” left available to humanity is even less than the roughly half a  trillion tons, and the deadline even closer. Preventing dangerous climate change,  thus, requires an aggressive commitment to mitigation.  As noted above, most estimates have been defined in terms of meeting a 2°C  target. It is thus very important to note that in the recent Paris Agreement that  was agreed in December 2015, a lower target was also included.12 Article 2.1(a)  of the Paris Agreement specifies the goal as  “Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C  above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature  increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would  significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change”.Of course, this kind of target entails an even smaller greenhouse gas budget.One implication of a serious commitment to mitigation is that many fossil fuels  (oil, coal) must remain unused or become stranded. As Christopher McGlade and  Paul Ekins write in their recent article in Nature, “Although there have previously  been fears over the scarcity of fossil fuels, in a climate-constrained world this is  no longer a relevant concern: large portions of the reserve base and an even  greater proportion of the resource base should not be produced if the  temperature rise is to remain below 2°C” (McGlade and Ekins 2015, p.190).This raises an important question of equity. Who may exploit the fossil fuel  reserves in their ownership and who may not? And, on what basis? Furthermore,  if people are disallowed from exploiting their fossil fuels does this justify  compensating them for the non-use? What would be an equitable response to  the necessity of leaving some fossil fuels in the ground?  This has important implications for developing countries, some of which contain  large reserves of fossil fuels. For example, Angola comes 149th out of 187 in a  ranking of countries by their Human Development Index, and Nigeria comes  152nd (equal with Cameroon). Furthermore, both are in the United Nations  Development Program’s “low human development” category (UNDP 2014,  p.162). And both have extensive oil reserves. The International Energy Agency  11 For projections of what the budget would be if other greenhouse gases were included see Collins and  Knutti (2013, p.1113: and pp.1107-113 more generally). They give three different projections depending on  what level of likelihood decision-makers want to have of meeting the 2°C target.  12 Some, such as the representatives of AOSIS, have campaigned for a 1.5°C target (Tschakert 2015).  13 For the Paris Agreement see .  14 For pessimistic commentary on the capacity to meet the targets in the Paris Agreement and the techniques  that might be employed to try to meet it see Anderson (2015).  15 For data on the coal, oil, and gas reserves that remain see IEA (2014, chapter 3 (oil), chapter 4 (natural  gas) and chapter 5 (coal)). It reports, for example, that there remain 1,699 billion barrels of oil in “proven  reserves” (that is reserves that it is 90% likely that they can be extracted at a profit), and 6,010 billion  barrels of conventional and unconventional oil reserves (IEA 2014, p.111).  13 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  reports in its most recent annual report, World Energy Outlook 2014, that “[s]ub-  Saharan Africa as a whole has around 65 billion barrels of proven oil reserves,  equivalent to around 5% of the world total. Three-quarters of these oil reserves  are held in two countries (Nigeria and Angola)” (IEA 2014, p.464). In addition to  this, “Africa is estimated to have 52 tcm of remaining recoverable conventional  natural gas resources, of which 31 tcm are in sub-Saharan Africa” (IEA 2014,  p.465).  As Gavin Bridge and Philippe Le Billon write, “Developing through oil is an  aspiration for many oil-producing countries but the reality of everyday life for  many in Angola, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Congo, and Saudi Arabia  falls far short of this goal” (Bridge and Le Billon 2013, p.125). Other countries,  such as Ecuador, rely heavily on their oil reserves. Ecuador comes much  higher—at 98th—(UNDP 2014, p.161). It is, though, highly dependent on its oil.  Writing 7 years ago, Larrea and Warnars write that “[p]etroleum, the single most  important product of the economy, accounted for 54% of total exports in the last  decade, and petroleum revenues made up on average 26% of government  revenues between 2000 and 2007” (Larrea and Warnars 2009, p.219).  It is important not just that humanity avoid triggering dangerous climate change,  but also that the burdens involved in combating climate change are shared justly.  The dominant framework as to what constitutes equitable burden sharing adopts  the doctrine of “Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective  Capabilities.” This is explicitly affirmed in Article 3.1 of the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change, which states that  “The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and  future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance  with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities. Accordingly, the developed country Parties should take the lead  in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof.”This doctrine of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities was also affirmed in Article 10 of the Kyoto Protocol.17 Furthermore,  it continues to inform all climate negotiations and is reiterated in the Paris  16 See:    df.  Note the doctrine predates the UNFCCC. For an early statement see the ‘Report of the United Nations  Conference on Environment and Development’ (the Rio Declaration) (1992). Principle 7 of this Report states  “States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and  integrity of the Earth's ecosystem. In view of the different contributions to global environmental  degradation, States have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developed countries acknowledge  the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development in view of the  pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources  they command.”   14 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  Agreement—in the Preamble and Article 2.2 and Article 4.19.18 On this approach,  all states have a shared responsibility to prevent harmful climatic changes (so the  responsibility is “common” to all), but some have greater responsibilities than  others, depending on how much they emitted and also what ability they have to  bear the burden (and so the responsibility is “differentiated”).The doctrine of “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities” has, to a large extent, been applied to the emission of greenhouse  gases. The focus has, thus, been largely on the “production process” and its  emission of greenhouse gases,20 and there has been much less focus on the  extraction of fossil fuels. This paper explores the issues surrounding the latter.  There is a strong case for doing so. As Paul Collier and Anthony Venables point  out, it is important to tackle the problem of climate change at root. Focusing  exclusively on those who use fossil fuels in the productive process (or, to go one  step further, to put one’s focus on consumers) multiplies problems because there  are so many producers and users, and there is a high likelihood of “leakage”  (Collier and Venables 2014, pp.493-494). For example, since many can burn  fossil fuels throughout the world, focusing on the productive process requires  widespread compliance by a very large proportion of these different actors. Given  this, it makes sense to consider measures that focus on the point of extraction:  for if one can do this successfully, one can reduce such leakage problems  (Collier and Venables 2014, pp.493-494).21At this point it should be noted that  some have sought to implement equitable policies concerning stranded fossil fuel  assets. The most notable of these is the Yasuní-ITT Initiative.22 The Initiative  18 See .  19 For an illuminating account of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capacities see  Rajamani (2006).  20 One exception to this is work on “consumption-based” accounting of greenhouse gas emissions rather  than “production-based” accounting. Consumption-based approaches focus on the emissions associated by  those consuming goods and services. Given the extent of emissions embodied in trade, consumption-based  and production-based accounting can diverge quite dramatically. See Davis and Caldeira (2010).  21 Collier and Venables discuss two kinds of leakage. The first (referred to in the text above) is what they  term “international leakage”: this refers to a situation in which if one group of agents implements some  demand-side policies (such as carbon taxes), consumers shift to another group of agents which does not  employ such policies (Collier and Venables 2014, pp.493-494 & 497-499). The second kind is what they term  “inter-temporal leakage”: this refers to a situation in which if one group of agents proposes to implement  some demand-side policies in the future, then consumers seek to increase their consumption now before  the policies are applied (Collier and Venables 2014, pp.494, 497 & 499-500). Their claim is that given this a  focus on the extractive process (a supply-side approach) is desirable.  The first kind of leakage might be argued to have more force than the second. The reason for this is  that the claim that the advance notification of a policy in the future might generate an increase in current  consumption seems to apply with force whether the policy is a demand-side one that applies instruments  such as carbon taxes or a supply-side one that seeks to reduce extraction at source. For a plan to implement  such a supply-side policy in the future would also generate incentives to increase extraction now. The first  argument, however, about the extent of leakage in the global economy where there is no effective regime  ensuring compliance with demand-side policies is hard to dispute.  22 What follows draws on the illuminating discussions of Ecuador’s Yasuní ITT Initiative by Matt Finer, Remi  Moncel, and Clinton N. Jenkins (2010, pp.63-66); Carlos Larrea and Lavinia Warnars (2009, pp.219-223);  Joan Martinez-Alier, Nnimmo Bassey, and Patrick Bond (2013); Laura Rival (2010, pp.358-365); María  Cristina Vallejo, Rafael Burbano, Fander Falconí, and Carlos Larrea (2015, pp.175-185).  15 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  concerns the large oil reserves in the Ishpingo–Tambococha–Tiputini oil fields,  located in the Yasuní National Park in Ecuador. The Yasuní-ITT Initiative was  first developed in 2007. Put at its simplest, the Initiative involved Ecuador not  using the oil reserves (and thereby not contributing to climate change), in  exchange for which it would be paid, thereby enabling Ecuador to develop. The  sum of oil at stake was considerable. A recent study reported that it involved “8million barrels of heavy crude oil” (indeed possibly up to 921 billion barrels in  reserve) and if it all remained in the ground it would result in a saving of 4million metric tons of CO2 (Vallejo, Burbano, Falconí, and Larrea (2015, p.175).  A Trust Fund was set up in 2010 to fund it (Martinez-Alier 2013). Thus, in  principle, this is an interesting case of stranding fossil fuel assets (thereby  contributing to mitigating climate change, among other things) while at the same  time compensating Ecuador, thereby contributing to its standard of living.  Unfortunately, the Initiative faltered. In August 2013 President Rafael Correa  declared that insufficient funds had been raised, and so drilling for oil  recommenced (Martinez-Alier 2013). This does not mean that it is not possible to  implement a scheme in which “not extracting fossil fuels” is compensated for  (and indeed there are many policies in which “non-use” of a natural resource—or  protection of environmental service—is paid for), but it does suggest that it needs  to learn from the problems that the Yasuní-ITT Initiative has faced.  16 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  THE QUESTIONS  Having provided the general background, this section turns to the core questions  to be examined in the remainder of the paper. The central overarching question  to be examined in this paper concerns the equitable treatment of those with fossil  fuel reserves. In the course of examining different answers to this question, the  analysis will be guided by six more specific questions to be examined. These are  specified as follows23.  1. The overall focus of this research is reliant on a normative assumption  regarding the equity implications of stranded assets. As such an initial  question of this research pertains to the merits of the ethical arguments,  both for and against the position that the issue of stranded assets should  incorporate equity considerations. Of particular interest is whether these  arguments are consonant or not with the notion of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  2. Has there been any work to date which has explored the proposed means  to account for these equity issues around the stranding of assets?  3. Is there any commentary on the merits of different decarbonization tools  in terms of their capacity to account for the potential equity implications of  stranded assets?  4. What would likely be entailed in undertaking an assessment which sought  to prioritize the order in which countries should have their assets stranded  (HDI, historical emissions, carbon intensity of the economy, available  resources, climate vulnerability, governance structures (for delivery of  services), etc.)?  5. What would be the implications of an equity approach to stranding assets  on the idea of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities? Of particular interest is whether such an approach to  stranding assets further explodes the binary classification of developed  vs. developing nations in common but differentiated responsibilities and  respective capabilities.  6. Would raising questions around equity and stranded assets generate  major political risks to the UNFCCC process?23 These questions were generated by a Scope of Work that was conceived of by Oxfam and  which formed the basis of engagement with the consultant.  24 This is quoted from pp.2-3 of the ‘Research Scope of Work.’  17 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  This section outlines the conceptual framework that will be employed.  Two concepts play a central role in the analysis. The first of these is equity. The  paper employs the notion of “Equity” specified in the Scope of Work.25 Equity  refers to what is fair and just. It is a distinctive value and should not be equated  with other traditional values like “charity” or “benevolence.” It refers to what is  owed to individuals—what they can claim as a matter of right, and not just what is  efficient. There are many different accounts of equity—ranging from egalitarian  ones to libertarian ones—but what they have in common is a commitment to  giving each person their due, and what they are entitled to.  A further point about equity: sometimes equity is used to refer to procedurally fair  decision-making processes. The focus on this paper is on equity as a  “substantive ideal”: that is, one that concerns the distribution of social, economic,  and environmental burdens and benefits. The paper will be in line with the values  expressed in Oxfam’s “Hang Together or Hang Separately” (2009).  Second, the paper seeks to develop principles and policies that are compatible  with other goals and objectives, and as such, policy consonance is a central  concept. For example, policies designed to prevent dangerous climate change  will impact considerably on other kinds of policy—most notably attempts to  develop and eradicate poverty. The aim then is to identify equitable principles  concerning stranding fossil fuel assets that contribute to the mitigation of  dangerous climate change but do so in ways that recognize rights to develop.  Finally, in terms of scope it should be noted that the research focuses  exclusively on the fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and natural gas. It does not  discuss other extractive industries such as minerals.  25 See p.3 of the ‘Research Scope of Work.’  18 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  RESEARCH DESIGN  This research draws on the literatures on extractive industries, climate change,  and development. More specifically, it draws on:   Literature in ethics on the responsibilities to combat climate change and  the doctrine of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities. This includes work by moral and political philosophers  (Caney 2005, 2010a,b, 2012, 2014; Gardiner et al.; Shue 2014;  Vanderheiden 2008), as well as work by Oxfam (2009) and EcoEquity’s  work on “Greenhouse Development Rights”)26. As part of this, it also  draws on the literature on the equity implications of a transition to a low  carbon society where relevant (for example, Nuffield Council on Bioethics  (2011, chapter 4); Newell et al. (2015)).   Literature on stranded assets, and stranded fossil fuel assets in particular.  This includes work such as Carbon Tracker (2013), Johnson et al. (2015,  pp.89–102), Lecuyer and Vogt-Schilb (2014), and Rozenberg, Vogt-  Schilb and Hallegatte (2014).   Literature on Low Carbon Development. This includes research such as  Marianne Fay et al. (2015) Decarbonizing Development, David Victor  (2011), analyses of different energy sources (IEA 2014), and the  assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.   Literature on natural resource management and development. This  includes work by Michael Ross (2012, 2015), Leif Wenar (2016), Paul  Collier (2007, pp.38-52), David Victor, David Hults, and Mark Thurber  (2012). It also includes Natural Resource Governance Institute (2014),  the policies of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (ETTI),and Oxfam’s work on “natural resources and rights.”One important point should be stressed here. The above literatures are all  relevant to the issues being explored in this paper. However, there is very little  work that both discusses the stranding of fossil fuel assets and does so with a  concern to determine what an equitable response would be. The second  question posed on page 16 asks:  “Has there been any work to date which has explored the proposed means to  account for these equity issues around the stranding of assets?”    The short answer to this is: no. There has been little work on the ways in which  one might account for the equity issues surrounding the stranding of assets.  There has been much work on the equitable response to climate change (see the  philosophical literature listed above). There has also been a considerable amount  of research on stranded assets, including stranded fossil fuel assets. There has  also been considerable discussion of the Yasuní-ITT Initiative.29 However, what  has been absent is analysis of different ways to account for the equity issues  surrounding the stranding of assets. The research on stranded fossil fuel assets  has focused on the implications for investors and business.30 The focus of work  and policies on extractive industries has often not focused directly on the  ecological limits of extraction.This paper thus draws on both the ethical and empirical literatures above to  answer these questions.  20 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  THE EQUITY DIMENSIONS OF STRANDED ASSETS  Having set out the questions, conceptual framework, and research design, the  paper turns to substantive analysis and to consider the remaining questions  identified. The first question is whether (1) “the issue of stranded assets should  incorporate equity considerations” and, if so, (2) “whether these arguments are  consonant or not with the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities and  respective capabilities” (p.15 above).32 We can deal with the two parts of this  question in turn.  1. Should the Issue of Stranded Assets Incorporate Equity Considerations?  First, the question of which fossil fuel assets should be stranded, on what basis,  and whether there should be any compensation for those who have stranded  assets inescapably raises questions of equity. Equity concerns the fair  distribution of burdens and benefits. As John Rawls puts it in A Theory of Justice,  “principles of social justice…define the appropriate distribution of the benefits and  burdens of social cooperation” (Rawls 1999, p.4). Any decision about stranding  (fossil fuel) assets unavoidably impacts on different people’s benefits (the  opportunities available to some to use fossil fuels) and burdens (the opportunities  denied to some to use fossil fuel reserves). For example, any policy that grants  some developing countries privileged access to using fossil fuels like coal, gas,  and oil thereby confers an advantage on them, and a corresponding  disadvantage on members of other countries that are denied such access. As  such it cannot but raise questions of equity.  More specifically, it raises the following questions:  a) Who are the rights bearers? Do countries have moral rights to the coal,  oil, and gas within their jurisdiction? Does this mean that governments are  the legitimate moral owners of such natural resources? Or are the rights  bearers in these cases individual men and women?  b) What is the right principle of distributive justice? How should the benefits  of hydrocarbons be distributed? Should their benefits be shared equally?  Or primarily to some? Should the interests of the poor be prioritized? Or  those who have used least fossil fuels historically? What is an equitable  distribution?  c) If a country’s use of certain hydrocarbons is limited, is it (or its members)  entitled to compensation?  d) If so, who should bear the burden of compensating those entitled to  compensation?  32 This is quoted from p.2 of the ‘Research Scope of Work.’  21 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  In short: imposing limits on the use of fossil fuels inevitably poses questions of  distributive justice about who is entitled to the benefits of hydrocarbons; which  ones may be used and which ones not, and on what basis; who, if anyone should  be compensated; and by whom?  Three further points should be noted.  A. An Analogy with REDD  First, a comparison with Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest  Degradation (REDD) may be instructive. REDD starts from the recognition that  forests play a vital role in absorbing CO2 and thus the mitigation of climate  change. In light of this, activities conducted under the heading of REDD seek to  protect forests and to reduce deforestation by paying those who would otherwise  engage in these activities not to do so.Although “preventing deforestation and protecting forests,” on the one hand, and  “not using fossil fuel reserves,” on the other, are not identical they are structurally  similar in morally relevant ways. In both cases there is an activity (using fossil  fuels/engaging in deforestation) that can have harmful effects on the climate  system (both increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere). Furthermore, in both cases desisting from this activity (leaving  fossil fuels in the ground/not engaging in deforestation) imposes a cost on some;  and, thus, in both cases, there is a question of who should pay this cost.  Now, REDD is widely recognized to involve questions of justice.34 Given this, and  given the similarities between REDD and stranded fossil fuel assets, there is a  strong case for applying standards of equity to decisions concerning stranded  fossil fuel assets.  Indeed, there is perhaps an even stronger case for a proposal analogous to  paying people not to extract fossil fuels, namely that it is easier to quantify the  volume of fossil fuels not extracted than the absorption of carbon of the kind  required by REDD.B. States’ Rights  A second point: it might be said that the fossil fuels in question are located in  specific countries—such as Libya or Nigeria or Iran—and, on this basis, some  might say the ethical issues are rather straightforward. Individual countries own  the natural resources in their territory and, therefore, there are no complex  questions of equity. States—on this view—have the rights either to utilize the  resources for domestic consumption or to benefit by selling the resources that  they own as they see fit.In reply: this is not plausible on either moral or legal grounds. First, on moral  grounds, it is not self-evident that countries own all the natural resources within  their territory. Furthermore, even if we take states or countries to own the fossil  fuels contained in their jurisdiction, the question of ownership is not  straightforward and raises issues of equity. For example, who exactly owns the  resources in this situation? If fossil fuels are not stranded within a country who  may extract them and who has a claim to their benefits? If they are stranded and  a system of compensation is also put in place who are the rightful recipients?  One answer is that the government is the owner. However, is this plausible if the  government is run by, and in the interest of, an unaccountable political élite? In  light of this, some suggest that the citizens of a state own the resources located  within its jurisdiction. By this they mean that the people own the resources  contained in a state’s territory and thus are entitled to some of the proceeds  (Wenar 2016). Drawing on this idea some propose a system of basic income  derived from the country’s natural resources, and they draw inspiration from  systems like the Alaska Permanent Fund.37 We then face the questions of equity  concerning the fairest distribution of resources among citizens.  Some, however, might dispute whether the “government” or “the people”  necessarily owns the resources, arguing that the natural resources belong to  whoever owns the property in which the resources are located, which might  belong to a private individual or a group of individuals or a firm.  These views are not exhaustive of the options. Some adopt a “cosmopolitan”  perspective and would argue that natural resources are owned by all humanity,  and not the government or citizens of the state in which they are located or  individuals or firms. In defense of this proposition it is argued that whether a  country has a rich stock of resources in its territory or not is simply a matter of  luck: their location there is not something for which the people can claim credit.  They cannot be said to deserve these resources (Beitz 1999, pp.136-143). On  For discussion of the Alaska Permanent Fund and for analyses of the argument that the revenues from such  natural resources can, and should, be used to fund a basic income see Widerquist and Howard (2012).  23 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  this basis, some argue that some portion of the proceeds from the world’s natural  resources should be shared globally (Pogge 2008, chapter 8).The central point here is that questions of justice and ethics are inescapable and  that questions of ownership rest on normative principles that stand in need of  justification.  In addition to this, it is widely recognized that there are moral limits on what  states may do with the natural resources in their jurisdiction. For example, they  have responsibilities to future generations, including future members of their own  society as well as members of other societies, and may not engage in actions  that fail to respect the legitimate interests of future generations (Brown Weiss  1989). In the context of climate change, this entails duties not to exceed a fair  share of emissions. Climate change undermines the rights of future generations  to life, health, food, and water (Caney 2010b). It also entails duties to act as a  good steward or trustee of the resources (Caney 2012b).  Finally, these moral points about the limits on a current government’s rights to  use natural resources like coal, oil, and gas are reflected in domestic and  international law. As Richard Barnes notes in Property Rights and Natural  Resources there are limits on the use of natural resources (Barnes 2009, p.232ff)  including limits under international environmental law (2009, pp.234-249). As he  further notes, there are also duties of stewardship—duties to conserve and  preserve land and natural resources for the benefit of future generations (Barnes  2009, pp.155-162). Many legal systems employ the concept of “public trust,” and  this has been interpreted as entailing fiduciary duties to protect renewable and  nonrenewable resources, and has led to “public trust litigation” to protect the  environment.For these reasons, the fact that coal, oil, and gas are located within the  jurisdiction of states does not entail that these are not subject to legal and ethical  principles.  C. Other Values  At this point a third important point should, however, be noted. This is that while  the phenomenon of stranded assets does raise questions of equity this does not  mean that this is the only relevant consideration. It is compatible with recognizing  that there are also other relevant considerations, ones that go beyond the  equitable distribution of fossil fuel use, and that these might, in some  circumstances, take priority.  For example, efficiency matters as well. This can have at least two distinct  implications. First: as was noted at the start, there is a very tight limit on the  volume of greenhouse gases that can be emitted if humanity is to enjoy a 50%  chance of meeting the 2°C target (Collins and Knutti 2013, p.1033) and this  becomes tighter still if we make the aim “to limit the temperature increase to  1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” (Paris Agreement Article 2.1(a)). Meeting this  target will be hard, given increasing per capita consumption, and given an  increasing global population which “is projected to increase by more than one  billion people within the next 15 years, reaching 8.5 billion in 2030, and to  increase further to 9.7 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100” (United Nations  Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division 2015, p.2).  With this in mind, there is reason to prioritize extracting fossil fuels with the least  warming potential (such as gas) over those which make a larger contribution to  climate change (such as coal). Given the imperative to prevent dangerous  climate change, and given these differences in their impact on the remaining  greenhouse budget, there is a very strong case for favoring extraction of the  energy sources with the least harmful greenhouse gases and for stranding fossil  fuel reserves that are more harmful.  Second, it is vitally important that fossil fuels are extracted in an efficient manner.  Governments and the international community have efficiency-based reasons for  prioritizing projects for extracting fossil fuels that have the most efficient and least  wasteful extraction process.  A concern for efficiency thus requires (other things being equal) both (i)  extracting fossil fuels with the least global warming potential and (ii) for maximally  cost-effective extraction processes.  It is important to recognize that recognizing the importance of efficiency does not  in itself entail that justice does not matter. On most accounts of justice what is  required, among other things, is the efficient protection of vital resources so as to  ensure the highest standard of living possible, and so efficiency (and getting the  most benefit per unit of cost from the remaining stock of fossil fuels that can be  extracted) matters for the realization of justice. It is also crucial to note that  stranding a fossil fuel asset (such as coal) because of its harmful effects and thus  inefficient use of the remaining greenhouse gas budget, might be accompanied  with compensation to such countries for the benefit forgone. So an efficiencybased  reason for keeping a fossil fuel in the ground can be combined with  compensation packages (if, pending the arguments to be considered below, such  compensation is required by justice).  In addition to efficiency, it is vitally important not simply that access to limited  fossil fuels is shared equitably but also that there is an effective policy in place  that can prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference. The final section of this  paper considers the point that focusing on distributive questions has various risks  25 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder  attached to it such as, for example, making an effective international climate  treaty less attainable (Caney 2014).  The upshot here, then, is that the decision to strand some fossil fuel assets and  not others and the decision whether to compensate those with stranded assets or  not does inescapably raise questions of justice and equity. However, there are  other important considerations—most notably the need to prevent dangerous  climate change as well as the need for an efficient use of remaining permissible  fossil fuels. Furthermore, given political realities and the difficulty of persuading  leading countries to engage in the necessary mitigation projects, it cannot be  assumed that we can realize both (i) an effective regime that prevents dangerous  climate change and (ii) does so in a way that shares burdens equitably and treats  those with fossil fuel assets equitably. It may, for example, be the case that  political leaders will commit to sufficiently ambitious climate targets but only in  ways that impose unjust burdens on others, such as adopting mitigation policies  with harmful side effects (Caney 2016).  2. Are these arguments consonant or not with the notion of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities?  Having established that there are important equity questions surrounding  stranding fossil fuel assets, the next question is whether these can be addressed  from within a framework that calls for a system of common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities.  A complete answer will emerge in the following section. However, it is possible to  say, in advance of that, that there is no reason to think that the burdens involved  in not extracting fossil fuels (or paying compensation to those required to abstain  from using their fossil fuels) cannot be allocated in accordance with the doctrine  of common but differentiated responsibilities. The doctrine of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities requires, roughly, that  everyone bears some responsibility but that some should bear a greater burden.  More specifically, the greatest burdens should be borne by the developed  countries; those who have emitted least and who have least ability to pay should  shoulder a lesser burden. Given this, one can realize the doctrine of common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, by granting the poorest  members of the world and those who have emitted the least (often an  overlapping group) with either the greatest access to fossil fuel reserves (or  alternatively compensation for not extracting them).  This addresses Question 1 as specified on page 15. This asked  for “the arguments, both for and against the position that the issue of stranded  assets should incorporate equity considerations” and “whether these arguments  26 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  are consonant or not with the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities.”The finding above is that the issue of stranded assets should include equity  considerations, but not only these, and that these arguments are consonant with  the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities.  CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHICH ASSETS SHOULD BE STRANDED  Having assessed whether the stranding of fossil fuel assets raises questions of  equity, this section turns to the issue of what criteria should be employed to  determine which assets should be stranded and on what basis. What are the  relevant criteria for deciding what is an equitable response to the stranding of  fossil fuel assets? It thus addresses the fourth question posed on page 15,  namely:  “What would likely be entailed in undertaking an assessment which sought to  prioritize the order in which countries should have their assets stranded?”To do so, it considers arguments for and against the following criteria: (a) level of  development, (b) historical responsibility, (c) the extent to which other resources  are available, arguing that each of these is relevant. It then considers the ways in  which (d) the carbon intensity of the economy, (e) climate vulnerability, and (f)  governance structures (for delivery of services) are relevant. More generally,  these criteria are employed here because they are commonly invoked in  academic analyses of climate change policies, and constitute a reasonably  exhaustive set of considerations that might be invoked.Each question will be considered in turn, but we can note, up front, that the  central finding is that an equitable response to the stranding of fossil fuel assets  (one that is informed by the principle of Common but Differentiated  Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities) would be informed primarily by the  state’s (a) level of development as measured by the Human Development Index,  (b) its historical record, and (c) the availability of other resources. The other  criteria mentioned clearly matter, but they should not necessarily guide which  assets should be stranded.  A: HDI and Development  First, one natural criterion to employ when determining who has rights to extract  fossil fuels, and, by how much, is the level of development. The relevance of this  consideration is recognized in the recent Sustainable Development Goals: the  first goal of which calls for the eradication of poverty.43 It is also firmly recognized  in the climate regime. For example, the preamble to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) affirms “the legitimate priority  needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth  and the eradication of poverty.”44 Crucially, if a policy on stranded fossil fuel  assets is to be in line with the doctrine of Common but Differentiated  Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities, it is essential that excessive  burdens are not placed on the world’s poorest, and that their right to develop in a  sustainable way is recognized. Stranding assets needed for development without  compensation would be in violation of the values and principles affirmed by the  principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities.  In light of this pressing goal, it can be argued that the least advantaged have a  strong claim to extract such remaining fossil fuels that can be used without  triggering a 2°C increase in global mean temperatures. Granting them rights to  extract such fossil fuel reserves can both (i) provide a source of energy for  domestic consumption, but also, crucially, (ii) can generate revenues through  exports.  To this one might add that there are rich fossil fuel reserves in many of the poor  regions of the world. For example, the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2014 reports  of sub-Saharan Africa that “[t]he region is rich in energy resources, but they are  largely undeveloped. Almost 30% of global oil and gas discoveries made over the  last five years were in the region” (IEA 2014, p.28). There have been “large gas  discoveries in Mozambique (mainly in the offshore Rovuma Basin) and in  Tanzania” which have been “complemented by pre-salt oil and gas discoveries in  the Kwanza Basin in Angola” (IEA 2014, p.462). The IEA adds that in 2013 there  have been “oil finds in the Keta-Togo-Benin Basin in Nigeria and further natural  gas finds in Mozambique” (IEA 2014, p.462).  In short, one might state the argument as follows:   Many live in severe poverty; and any equitable response to existing fossil  fuel resources needs to acknowledge the importance of enabling the poor  to develop [the developmental imperative].   Granting developing countries extraction rights would facilitate  development for two reasons. First, development requires energy (for  agriculture, transportation, health, education, and industry). Coal, oil, and  gas are sources of energy.45 Second, however, and perhaps more  crucially, they can provide a valuable stream of revenue if they are  exported [the role of fossil fuels].  45 These can, of course, be used in ways that have harmful effects on human health. It is worth noting here  that other forms of energy that are very heavily used by the poor – including burning biomass – also have  harmful effects on health. Paul Wilkinson, Kirk Smith, Michael Joffe, Andrew Haines write that “2·4 billion of  the world’s population, disadvantaged by lack of access to clean energy, are exposed to high levels of indoor  air pollutants from the inefficient burning of biomass fuels” (2007, p.965). On the harmful health effects of  current fossil fuel use see Wilkinson et al. (2007, p.967).  29 Oxfam America Research Backgrounder   Therefore, the least advantaged have a special claim to extract existing  fossil fuel reserves (with an upper limit specific by limits imposed by the  2°C target).  The upshot of this argument, then, is that the remaining fossil fuel reserves  should be distributed so as to allow the global poor to extract fossil fuels in their  countries. The proposal would be to allocate rights to extract fossil fuels in  proportion to levels of underdevelopment.  Clearly to put this into practice one would need to have to be able to  operationalize a conception of development. One plausible possibility (mentioned  briefly above) is the Human Development Index. This builds on the “capabilities”  approach developed by Amartya Sen and is employed by the United Nations  Development Program in its “Human Development Reports.”46 The HDI provides  a useful measure of development and as the UNDP’s Human Development  Reports attest, it can be operationalized.  Analysis. Having set out the consideration, we may now consider its strengths  and limitations. One core strength of this approach is its recognition of the  paramount importance of addressing global poverty, and its compatibility with the  doctrine of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities.  Some aspects of the argument as it stands are vulnerable to criticism and stand  in need of further argument. Four points should be borne in mind.  First: Two reasons were given as to why granting extraction rights to the world’s  least advantaged further development. It is worth noting that the first of these—  the claim that they could benefit from extraction rights by using them for domestic  consumption—is open to question. Energy is crucial for development but this  does not, in itself, necessarily require the use of coal, oil, or gas (Hayward 2007:  Caney 2012a). Other kinds of energy are available—including most notably  renewables—and it would thus be a mistake to infer from the need for energy  that this should be met by fossil fuels. For example, the IEA’s World Energy  Outlook 2014 also reports that sub-Saharan Africa is “endowed with huge  renewable energy resources, especially solar and hydro, as well as wind and  geothermal” (IEA 2014, p.28).47 In addition to this, some countries such as Kenya  and Ethiopia have considerable theothermal potential (IEA 2014 p.473). Other  countries—such as Brazil, China, India, and Turkey—all also have considerable  hydroelectric potential (Yüksel 2009).  This objection does not, of course, undermine the other reason for granting  extraction rights to developing countries, namely that by doing so it provides a  stream of revenue and can thus further development (Bridge and le Billon 2013).  Second: At this point, however, it is worth noting that this second development-based  argument also needs to be handled carefully, for it is unlikely to be the  case that granting extraction rights to fossil fuels to be used for export is  necessary for development. This would assume that there are no other options  for development, and we would need further argument to show whether this is  the case. The conclusion should, thus, be that granting extraction rights provides  one source of revenue for development.  To develop this point further: we should bear in mind that rather than granting  developing countries the extraction rights for remaining fossil fuels, another way  of meeting their development needs would be for those assets to be stranded but  the society be compensated for that. There could, that is, be a system that built  on the underlying rationale that underpinned the Yasuní-ITT Initiative, and sought  to further development, while also keeping fossil fuels in the ground. Clearly,  such a proposal would need to be able to address many practical issues  (including those that led to the failure of the Yasuní-ITT Initiative, such as  ensuring a regular supply of revenue). However, the relevant point in this context  is simply that recognizing the developmental needs of some countries with fossil  fuels does not in itself necessarily entail granting them extraction rights (for  revenues) because an alternative system (stranding plus compensation) could, in  principle, realize the same goal too. Fossil fuel rich developing countries can thus  legitimately make the point that assuming that some remaining fossil fuels can be  extracted, then—other things being equal—they have a strong pro tanto claim to  be entitled either (a) to extract them to further their developmental goals or (b) to  receive suitable compensation and be enabled to develop if their fossil fuel  assets are stranded.  Third: At this point a third point is worth noting, namely that—irrespective of  whether fossil fuel rich developing countries receive extraction rights or whether  their assets are stranded and they receive compensation—it is crucial to ensure  that the benefits are shared equitably (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2011,  chapter 4, pp.76-77) and that they do not simply go to unaccountable political  and economic élites. It is, of course, a familiar fact that many resource-rich  countries have experienced low development and that benefits have not been  shared equitably. The extensive literature on the “resource curse” and on  managing natural resources effectively and justly is, of course, key here.48 For  the argument from development to be persuasive, then, it needs to show that  granting extraction rights (or financial compensation received as part of an  agreement to strand fossil fuel assets) would actually benefit the needy and  vulnerable, and that the revenues generated would not go to élites.  Fourth: It is important to recognize that the development-based argument for  granting access to fossil fuels could only generate limited rights to extract that  would apply in the short-term but would need to be phased out. Given the volume  of greenhouse gases that may be permissibly emitted (Allen et al. 2009, pp.1163-  1166), it is vital that all countries—including developing countries—transition to a  low-carbon economy.  The verdict: There is an imperative to develop. Given that some countries have  fossil fuel reserves and development needs, there is a case for either allocating  the remaining permissible fossil fuels to developing countries or stranding the  assets but compensating the societies for the benefit foregone. However, other  sources of energy and other ways of promoting development should also be  borne in mind.  B: Historical Responsibility  Having considered one criterion, we turn now to a second. Many ethical analyses  of climate change argue that the ascription of responsibilities to mitigate climate  change should take into account the historical record. Such approaches appeal  to a principle of “historical responsibility,” according to which (roughly stated) past  actions have implications for future rights and responsibilities. A very common  variant of this argument focuses on the use of fossil fuels in the past, arguing that  those who have used the most and thus emitted the most greenhouse gases  have the greatest responsibility to mitigate climate change and fund adaptation  (Neumayer 2000; Shue 2014, pp.182-186; Caney 2005, 2010a).  One question then is whether the underlying kind of reasoning—one that appeals  to the concept of “historical responsibility”—can be applied to the subject of this  report, namely on who can extract the remaining fossil fuels and, if so, to what  extent, and, on what basis. Is it possible to draw lessons about extraction rights  bearing in mind the historical record?  To answer this question, it is worth distinguishing between different  interpretations of the concept of “historical responsibility.” One has been  introduced above. It states:  . The Use Version: The more that an agent (say, a given society) has used  fossil fuels for energy in the past, and thus the more that they emitted  greenhouse gas emissions in the past, then the less that that agent has a  claim to future use (and future emissions); furthermore, by the same  reasoning, the less that an agent has used fossil fuels in the past, and  thus the less that they emitted greenhouse gases in the past, then the  more they have a claim to future use.  This is the conventional principle that is commonly invoked in ethical analyses of  climate change.  In itself this principle does not entail any particular conclusion about extraction  rights. However, with this in mind we might consider two other interpretations of  the concept of historical responsibility that, arguably, do have implications for  extraction rights. Consider, for example,  B. The Extraction Version: The more that an agent (say, a given society) has  extracted fossil fuels in the past the less strong their claim to extract fossil  fuels in the future; and the less that an agent has extracted fossil fuels in  the past the more that they have a claim to extract them in the future.  The rough thought here is that if there is a resource which is limited (either  because it is finite or because it has to be limited to meet a societal goal, in this  case avoiding dangerous climate change) then, other things being equal, those  who have taken most in the past have least claim to take it in the future; and  those who have taken least in the past have the strongest claim to take it in the  future.  Consider too a third principle which is also grounded in the idea of historical  responsibility:  C. The Benefit Version: The more that an agent (say, a given society) has  benefited from the extraction of fossil fuels in the past the less strong their  claim to future benefits from fossil fuels; and, the less that an agent has  benefited from the extraction of fossil fuels in the past the more that they  have a claim to the benefits from the extraction of fossil fuels in the future.  The Extraction Version and the Benefit Version might come to roughly similar  conclusions, but it is worth noting that they are distinct. Some might extract some  resources but others, in addition to those who extracted the principles, might  benefit from them. This might happen in at least three ways. First, later  generations might enjoy benefits from the extraction activities of earlier  generations; second, if a country exports the natural resources then the firms that  purchase them, their shareholders and their employees also benefit, although  they themselves were not involved in the extraction process; finally, consumers  might benefit from the extraction of resources but not be involved in the  extraction process.  Though they are distinct, it is worth noting that, in the context that is the focus of  this paper (namely the equity issues surrounding stranding carbon assets), both  the Extraction Version and the Benefit Version might provide support for the view  that developing countries have a strong claim either to extract existing fossil fuel  reserves or to compensation for not extracting them.  The underlying principle that agents should bear responsibility for their past  actions is an established one. Its application to the policies required to combat  climate change and to the extraction of existing fossil fuel reserves, however,  faces some complications.  First, one response to appeals to historical responsibility is that while the current  generation may legitimately be held responsible for its past actions it is unfair to  make it pay for the actions of previous generations. This is a point often made  against the Use Version. That is, it is often said to be unfair to require current  generations to bear a burden because of the emissions of past generations of  their society.  Someone might argue, in a similar vein, that the Extraction Version is unfair.  Current generations should not be made to bear a burden because past  generations of their society extracted fossil fuels.  A number of different replies can be made to this concern. For example, some  would respond that the agent in question is not an individual but a country. The  argument then is that industrialized countries, like the UK, extracted fossil fuels in  the past and so these countries have a reduced claim now (Caney 2005, pp.758-  759).  Others would respond that the objection has no force at all against the Benefit  Version. They can reply that even though many fossil fuels were extracted by  previous generations and not by current individuals, current individuals (primarily  in affluent countries) have benefited from the emissions of the past and so should  pay. In addition to this, many others—in the developing world—have not so  benefited from past extraction and so are entitled to benefit from the extraction of  remaining fossil fuels.49 The Benefit Version is thus not undermined by the fact  that many fossil fuels were extracted by previous generations since its focus is  not on who extracted (or who used) fossil fuels, but on who benefited from the  extraction of fossil fuels, and current people benefit from the extraction of fossil  fuels which they were not involved in extracting.  A second objection sometimes made against arguments which rely on the  principle of historical responsibility is that it can be unfair to penalize people who  engaged in certain actions in the past if they could not have reasonably known  about the implications of their past actions. This is a point often made in  connection with the use of fossil fuels in the past. The argument is that those who  emitted high volumes of greenhouse gases in the past were often excusably  ignorant of their harmful impacts, and thus it is unreasonable to penalize them for  those consequences. Some might argue in a similar vein that it might be unfair to  deprive people now of rights to extract fossil fuels because, and to the extent  that, they were excusably ignorant of the future implications of their actions. The  thought here would be: If they had known of the future implications then they  might have behaved differently and lowered their use.  This raises a reasonable concern. However, again a number of counterarguments  have been made. In particular, some will argue that whatever force  this has for the Extraction Version, it does not have much force against the  Benefit Version. The point remains that some did in fact benefit and others do so,  and they have benefited considerably from this (whereas others did not); and it  seems unreasonable to ignore this when considering who can extract fossil fuels  in the future. Thus, when some have benefited from the prior extraction of fossil  fuels, it is not unfair to ascribe a burden to them.A third point: Some criticize arguments from historical responsibility, arguing that  people should not be held responsible for either all of the amount of fossil fuels  they have extracted or for all the benefits they have received from the extraction  of fossil fuels in the past. They argue that people should bear a responsibility  only if their extraction of fossil fuels in the past exceeds their “fair share” of what  they can extract, or if their benefits from the past extraction of fossil fuels exceed  a “fair share” of benefits. In both cases this raises the question of what  constitutes a fair share of either (i) extraction rights and (ii) benefits from  extraction in the past. In light of the previous discussion of the right to develop,  one appealing proposal is that people should have a right to develop and should  not be held responsible for actions needed to attain that standard of living, but  they can be held responsible for actions in excess of that. This position adopts a  “poverty-sensitive” principle of historical responsibility (Caney 2010a). If we apply  this to the Extraction Version, the argument would claim that once a society has  extracted over and above what it needs to develop, then any additional extraction  of fossil fuels can be borne in mind; and the more that a society extracts after  that the less, other things being equal, it can claim in the future. Likewise, the  less it extracts after that, the more it can legitimately extract in the future. The  Benefit Version can be reformulated in a similar way. It would state that the more  benefits a society has derived from the extraction of fossil fuels over and above  the attainment of a decent minimum standard of living then the weaker its claim  to extract existing fossil fuels in the future; the less that it has benefited from  extraction in the past, the stronger its claim to extract and benefit from fossil fuels  now and in the future.  A fourth point remains. The analysis above draws attention to two principles that  could be applied to the issue of extractive rights—the Extraction Version and the  Benefit Version. It has also noted that although the two may generally converge  in their conclusions there is no guarantee that they always will. This raises the  question of which is the more plausible and how to decide which should take  priority if they conflict. This raises complex issues. Three considerations are  worth noting:  A. Some will have extracted inefficiently and wastefully in the past. One  worry about the Benefit Version is that if some extracted a resource but  did not benefit greatly from that extraction because they were wasteful,  the Benefit Version would seem to entail that less can be asked of them  than of another society that has been more efficient at deriving benefits  from similar extraction levels. It seems wrong (and to set a bad  precedent) to let their inefficiency or wastefulness mean that they are  entitled to more in the future. If they are responsible for an inefficient  process and so derive fewer benefits than they could have had, then it is  not clear why they should have stronger claims on future resources than  others who have been more efficient in the past.  a. To meet this it would be better to redefine the Benefit Version so  that it holds that those who had the “opportunity to benefit” from  the extraction of fossil fuels and so “could have benefited” from  the extraction have diminished claims in the future in proportion  with that opportunity to benefit (independently of whether they fully  derived the benefit from the extraction process). Otherwise those  who extracted efficiently in the past get penalized (in comparison  with those who extracted inefficiently), and the inefficient are  rewarded for their wastefulness.  B. Second, it is arguable that the more fundamental notion is that of  benefiting. People generally care about opportunities to extract because  of the opportunities to benefit. If a country’s fossil fuel assets are stranded  it seems very plausible to think that their primary concern will be that a  valuable source of benefits has been denied them. Given this, it seems  that what they really care about—what really matters—are the benefits of  extraction.  C. Third, as was noted above, the Benefit Version is not vulnerable to certain  objections made against the Extraction Version. It can more easily explain  why those who live in societies which have in the past extracted fossil  fuels may—other things being equal—have a reduced claim to the  36 Climate change, equity and stranded assets  benefits of the remaining fossil fuel resources even when they themselves  were not involved in the past extraction.  For these reasons, while both matter, and while more could be said about the  merits and demerits of both, the Benefit Version might be more fundamental.  In summary, countries that have either extracted more fossil fuels in the past  (the Extraction Version) or have benefited more from the extraction of fossil fuels  in the past (the Benefit Version) have a weaker claim to the remaining stock of  fossil fuels that may permissibly be used. As a corollary, those countries with  lower historical records of extracting fossil fuels and/or benefiting from the  extraction of fossil fuels have a stronger claim to extract and/or enjoy the benefits  of remaining fossil fuel reserves. Given the third point made above (§3),  however, the historical record is not the only relevant consideration: the level of  development matters too.The first two criteria, thus, play a crucial role in determining who have strong  claims to extract and benefit from existing reserves of coal, oil, and gas—the past  record and the level of development.52 However, certain other criteria might also  be suggested.  C: Available Resources  One of these is whether other resources are available. As was argued above,  fossil fuel reserves have two uses, both of which are relevant for allocating  extraction rights. One use is domestic consumption. A second use, which is  generally recognized to be more significant, is as a good that can be exported  and thus generate revenues.  It is worth noting that, in both cases, the case for granting extraction rights (or for  compensating non-use of fossil fuels) depends to a large extent on whether the  society that has fossil fuel reserves has other resources available.  51 It is worth re-iterating the point that the fact that a given country has a strong claim to develop and  increase its energy consumption does not necessarily translate into a right to extract any existing fossil fuels  in its jurisdiction. It entails a right to develop, but as was noted in the previous subsection this can  sometimes be realized in other ways. So just because a country is not required to bear a heavy burden does  not, in itself, entail that it should use fossil fuels if there are alternatives available that it can employ. It is  important to bear in mind here – and elsewhere when considering claims to use existing coal, oil, and gas  reserves – that what matters is not that people have rights to use certain resources but rather that they  have rights to secure certain interests (in food, water, health, life, and a decent standard of living) (Hayward  2007, Caney 2012).  52 This position is similar in spirit to the Greenhouse Development Rights Approach, pioneered by EcoEquity  and others. In recent work, they have proposed a “Climate Equity Reference Framework” that allocates  responsibilities according to (a) capability to pay (and so people’s level of development) and (b)  responsibility (and so people’s historic emissions). This provides an appealing interpretation of the doctrine  of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities because it ascribes  responsibilities to all, but it also calls for “differentiation” to reflect people’s different levels of emissions in  the past and different levels of development now. One central difference with the approach taken in this  paper, however, is that its focus is on consumption of fossil fuels and the related emissions, whereas the  approach here concerns the extraction of fossil fuels.  Consider first a case where a society extracts fossil fuels and uses them in part  to meet domestic consumption needs. Their claim for this kind of use will depend  on whether they have other sources available that can also serve those same  needs. Say, for example, there are two countries, X and Y, with identical needs,  but where X has more access to clean sources of energy (such as solar  photovoltaic, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, or tidal) than Y does. In such a  case then, other things being equal, X has a less strong case than Y. Where  there are substitute forms of energy then a person or country’s right to extract  and use energy does not entail a right to serve those needs through the use of  fossil fuels (Caney 2012a).  Consider now, secondly, the case of a country extracting resources for export. A  similar point applies. That is, if a country has other (non-fossil fuel) resources in  addition to fossil fuel reserves that it can export or it has other kinds of goods  which it can trade profitably, then its case for using fossil fuels is accordingly  weaker since it can develop its economy through exporting those other natural  resources or providing other services or skills.  For these two reasons, the strength of claims to use fossil fuels (either for  domestic energy consumption or for export) depends on what other resources a  country has access to (to meet its domestic energy needs or to export to other  countries).  In summary, this section has, thus far, identified three criteria that should inform  policies concerning which assets should be stranded and whether compensation  should be paid to those with assets: (a) their standard of living as reflected in  their HDI, (b) the extent to which they have extracted fossil fuels in the past or  benefited from the extraction of fossil fuels, and (c) whether people have other  ways of meeting developmental needs. The next three subsections briefly  explore three other considerations.  D: Carbon Intensity of the Economy  First, one might consider the carbon intensity of the economy. This measures the  amount of carbon emitted in relation to GDP (Zhang et al. 2013, p.688).“Carbon intensity” thus measures the efficiency of the use of fossil fuels. Many  states seek to reduce the carbon intensity of their production. It might then be  suggested that the stranding of assets should be guided by how efficient a  country is in using its fossil fuel reserves.  Three points can be made in reply. First, the efficient use of fossil fuels is clearly  an important policy objective.54 It also helps advance the cause of justice, for less  wasteful use of scarce resources better enables people to promote their standard  of living. At the same time, however, efficiency is not the only relevant  consideration, and it would be unfair to penalize those who lack efficient  technologies. In addition to this, one response to high carbon intensity might be  not to take that as an immutable fact, but rather to improve it.  Furthermore, and more significantly, when fossil fuels are sold for export the  carbon intensity of the country that is exporting them is not the relevant  consideration: rather it is the efficiency of the importing country. So here  countries with high carbon intensity should not be denied permission to extract  the fossil fuels in their country.  Third, we should recall the discussion of efficiency in the above, where it was  noted that there are strong efficiency-based (and justice-based) reasons for  extracting relatively clean fossil fuels (like gas) over fossil fuels (like coal) which  have a higher global warming potential. One corollary of this might be that where  a developing country has fossil fuel reserves that have a high global warming  potential then there are efficiency-based reasons for stranding such fossil-fuel  assets; but, there may also be justice-based reasons for compensating those  affected for the opportunity forgone (if, say, they are developing or if they have  not extracted them in the past). The policy response to two countries which are  equally poor and have equally low extraction records in the past but one (S1) has  cleaner fossil fuels than the other (S2) might be for S1 to have rights to extract  and for S2 to be denied those but allocated compensation instead for stranding  what would otherwise be a lucrative source of revenue.  E: Climate Vulnerability  Some might propose that vulnerability to the climate system should bear on the  equitable stranding of assets.  In reply: the fact that some countries—particularly developing ones—are highly  vulnerable to climatic changes clearly matters and should be addressed.  However, it can be argued that this is a matter for “adaptation” to climate change  and it is thus not clear why it should bear on a country’s “mitigation”  responsibilities.  Someone might respond to this point by arguing that a country’s exposure to  various harms is important and thus countries need a revenue stream to pay for  the necessary adaptation. However, while this is true it takes us back to the first  consideration (VII.A. HDI and Development) for what it points out is that the level  of development matters and this is already covered by the first consideration.  Societies facing severe challenges like poor infrastructure, poverty, and disease  would be prioritized according to the first criterion: a country’s vulnerability to  climate change is thus subsumed under this and there is no reason to give it  differential treatment.  One complication to this analysis concerns its implications for countries that face  expensive adaptation funds. Compare two countries with such costs. One of  these has succeeded in increasing its Human Development Index, but the other  one which faced similar opportunities has not done so. If we look just to the level  of development, then the first society will receive less assistance here than the  second society, and this seems perverse. It penalizes societies for performing  well and raising their HDI. This will strike many as both unfair in principle and  also as having perverse incentive effects.Two points might be made here. First, this raises an important concern. It entails  that those determining which assets should be stranded (and which of those  should be compensated) should look beyond just the level of development, and  also take into account the opportunities different societies have to develop and  factor that in. Second, however, the point under discussion does not necessarily  entail singling out adaptation costs for climate change as a particular reason to  attribute extraction rights: rather it calls for taking into account the burdens  different societies face (which may include climate-related adaptation costs but  may also include other kinds of burdens too). In short, then, it calls for a use of  human development indices that goes beyond just the level of development  attained and also takes into account the context, the incentive effects and the  opportunities facing societies.  F: Governance Structures  Consider now governance structures. This is clearly vitally important and, as the  extensive literature on the resource curse attests, the kind of political regime in  place plays a major role in determining whether a society benefits from its  ownership of natural resources or not. It is a commonplace notion that many  countries rich in oil, coal, and gas remain poor and prone to conflict. Initiatives on  ensuring transparency and accountable government thus play a vital role (Collier  2007, pp.38-52; Ross 2012; Wenar 2016).Realizing good governance, however, raises several difficult practical and ethical  questions, and several points need to be borne in mind.  First, it is important to be clear about what follows from the importance of  accountable governance structures. The absence of strong accountable  governance structures in place does not in itself entail that a people have a  lesser claim on natural resources (or on compensation for stranded assets). It is  not a reason to penalize the members of those states. Rather it is a reason to  work to reform the governance structures and thereby render them more  transparent and accountable. It would thus be a mistake to take poor governance  as a given and respond to it in a reactive way. The best response is to continue  to work towards transparency and accountability. This is valuable as a goal in  itself. However, it is also valuable as a way of realizing a fair distribution of the  benefits of natural resources within a society and over time.Second, however, it has been argued that fossil fuel revenues may make reform  of governance more difficult, and, it might then be argued, that if this is the case  there is a case for not allocating extraction rights to societies with poor  governance institutions.58 Clearly, a great deal depends here on the empirical  question of the determinants of good governance. In his The Oil Curse, Michael  Ross has argued that petroleum undermines democracy (2012, chapter 3).  Furthermore, in his 2015 paper “What Have We Learnt about the Resource  Curse” he concludes that “the greater a country’s oil income, the less likely it has  been to transit to democracy” (2015, p.243) and that “there is strong evidence  that higher levels of oil wealth help authoritarian regimes, and authoritarian  rulers, ward off democratic pressures” (2015, p.248).  Several further points need, however, to be noted. The first is that Ross also  notes that there are exceptions. He agrees with Thad Dunning’s (2008) argument  that Latin America is an exception to the trend found elsewhere. As Ross writes  of oil-producing states that transition to democracy: “All five of the countries that  made successful transits [to democracy] were in Latin America: Venezuela  (1958), Bolivia (1982), Argentina (1983), Mexico (2000), and Ecuador (2002) …  all of Latin America’s oil producers …are now democracies” (Ross 2012, p.85:  see also pp.85-86). Clearly, then, the relationship is not an iron rule.  Further support for this conclusion can be found in Pauline Jones Luong and  Erika Weinthal’s study of post-Soviet states (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia,  Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan). In Oil Is Not a Curse: Ownership Structure and  Institutions in Soviet Successor States (2010) they find that “even those mineralrich  states that do not inherit strong institutions can nonetheless build them”  (2010, p.4). On their view, the ownership structure—whether there is state  ownership or private ownership—plays a key (and neglected) role.  To all this we should add that Ross notes that whether petroleum has effects on  democracy, corruption, or violence depends on various conditions. As he puts it,  “these effects are conditional” (Ross 2015, p.240). He further notes that the  relationship has not always held. Indeed, he reports that “[f]rom 1960 to 1979, oil  states and nonoil states were equally likely to transition to democracy” (Ross  2015, p.245). The link is thus not set in stone and there remains disagreement  about whether oil stabilizes democracy or not (Ross 2015, p.245).Given this, a case by case approach seems to be called for, and general  statements about oil undermining democracy, while plausible in many cases, do  not always necessarily hold.  In summary, the key considerations from the point of view of equity are (a) the  level of development, (b) the historical record of extraction and benefits from past  extraction, and (c) the availability of other resources60. The three other  considerations analyzed, while important in their own right, do not necessarily  directly bear on the specific question of the equitable response to stranding fossil  fuel assets. The one exception to this is that the efficiency-based criterion give us  reason to distinguish between two countries which are identical in all respects but  one has cleaner fossil fuel reserves than another. Here both have the same claim  to the same standard of living, but in the case of one (where the fossil fuel is  relatively clean) it might be best to permit extraction and in the case of the other  (where the fossil fuel is relatively dirty) it might be best to strand the asset but  provide commensurate compensation.  and treat them as the legitimate owners of the natural resources, or not. On this view, external countries  and corporations enable autocracies to persist by trading with them, and thus the extent to which  undemocratic regimes persist in fossil-fuel rich countries is not fixed and immutable, but depends, in part,  on the behavior of the international community (Pogge 2008, Wenar 2016).  60 Might there be other criteria? In his forthcoming book Justice and Natural Resources (forthcoming), Chris  Armstrong argues that resource rich countries should be compensated if their fossil fuel assets are  stranded. His reasoning is that countries in this position are having to forego an opportunity that would  otherwise have been available to them (Armstrong forthcoming, chapter 10 section V). Two points should  be noted here.  First, implementing a rule that has the effect that an agent must forego certain opportunities to enrich  themselves does not in itself entail that that agent is entitled to receive compensation. To think this  presupposes that the agent has a right to the economic benefits they would have been able to secure if this  rule had not been implemented. It assumes, that is, that we should employ as a moral baseline “the  standard of living that they would have had were it not for the rule” and that we are required to  compensate for departures from that baseline. However, without further argument, it is not clear why we  should accept these assumptions, and assume that agents have such rights. For example, banning the sale  of landmines might reduce someone’s profit margin; but it does not follow that those who would otherwise  make money from selling landmines have a right to compensation. Thus the claim that fossil fuel rich  countries necessarily have a right to compensation because stranding assets reduces the possibility of them  securing benefits is without justification.  A second point: it is worth noting that Armstrong’s claims are plausible in the context of developing  countries. However, this is because such countries have a right to develop (and denying them the extraction  rights without any compensation) compromises this right. Here what is doing the work is the right to  develop. The most plausible version of his argument thus takes us back to the argument from development  considered above.  IMPLICATIONS OF AN EQUITY APPROACH FOR CBDR  Having considered what criteria might guide the stranding of fossil fuel assets,  this section turns to the fifth question specified in this research, namely  “What would be the implications of an equity approach to stranding assets on  the idea of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities? Of particular interest is whether such an approach to stranding  assets further explodes the binary classification of developed vs. developing  nations in common but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities.” The upshot of the analysis in the above section is that an equity approach to  stranding assets is extremely likely to result in a differentiation between different  non-Annex I countries and will undermine a simple distinction between  developed and developing countries. The criteria that are morally relevant  ones—from the point of view of justice and equity—come in degrees and so will  not sustain a division between Annex I and non-Annex I countries.  To illustrate the point, consider three criteria that, it was argued, are relevant to  determining an equitable response to the stranding of fossil fuel assets, namely:  1. Development needs and performance in terms of HDI;  2. Historical responsibility in terms of extraction of fossil fuels in the past or  access to benefits from past extraction; and,  3. Access to other sources of energy and to other sources of wealth.  Different countries will differ on all of these dimensions. Consider (1): Countries  will, for example, clearly fall along a spectrum. They will vary in terms of their  current standard of living and the challenges they face.Consider now (2): If—following the argument made above—an equitable  response to climate change requires taking into account either (a) how much  societies have extracted fossil fuels in the past (the Extraction Version) or how  much opportunity benefit they have derived from past extraction (the Benefit  Version), or some combination of both, then clearly different societies will score  differently. So (2) will yield a continuum and there is no guarantee that it will  coincide with (1).  Turning now to (3): Countries will also vary in the extent to which they can  develop without relying on exporting fossil fuels; some, for example, may have  other natural resources or access to markets denied to others.In short, given that the three criteria admit of degrees and given that countries  often perform very differently from each other compared on each of those criteria  a simple distinction between Annex 1 and other countries is hard to defend. This  said, while any strict binary categorization is difficult to sustain it would still, of  course, be possible to group various countries together in rough categories and  there may be an advantage from a political point of view of not abandoning broad  categorizations.  The discussion so far has focused on how an “equity” approach would lead to a  more complex differentiation of responsibilities and undermine the traditional  Annex 1/non-Annex I categorization of Common but Differentiated  Responsibilities and Respective Capacities. One further implication should also  be noted, namely that it could also yield quite different conclusions as to who  bears a responsibility. If for example, a country like Equatorial Guinea is granted  rights to extract its resources (a right denied to some) and if, as a result, it  acquires considerable revenues and scores highly on the HDI then, as a result, it  would acquire some responsibilities.63 To give an example: those countries that have unusually high access to geothermal energy will, other  things being equal, have weaker claims to use any fossil fuels they possess than those that do not. This  bears on the claims of those countries that include East African Rift Valley, since this is “considered one of  the most exciting prospects in the world for geothermal development, with total potential estimated at  between 10 GW and 15 GW – more than East Africa’s total existing power generation capacity, a large share  of which is concentrated in Ethiopia and Kenya” (IEA 2014, p.473).  64 I owe this point, and the examples that follow, to a very helpful comment by an anonymous referee. Note  also that what was earlier termed the Benefit Version might also support further responsibilities on  resource rich countries (and do so more than the Extraction Version). A country like Equatorial Guinea may  have responsibilities to disadvantaged societies that lack resources and thus lack the same opportunity to  derive revenues (like Eritrea or Swaziland). Since these resource-poor societies have not benefited, and  cannot benefit, from extracting resources then others, more fortunate than them in terms of their resource  endowments, might (other things being equal) be under a responsibility to share some of the benefits. The  Extraction Version, by contrast, would entail simply that countries that have historically not exploited their  fossil fuel reserves may do so, but as such it does not directly help improve the condition of poor countries  that lack such resources (like Eritrea or Swaziland).  POLITICAL RISKS  Having identified the equity issues surrounding stranding of fossil fuel assets, this  final section considers problems that seeking to realize equity might encounter.  More specifically it considers the sixth question specified on page 15, namely:  “Would raising questions around equity and stranded assets generate  major political risks to the UNFCCC process?”In reply: there are political risks in pursuing an equitable position on stranding  fossil fuel assets, although the magnitude of these risks will vary depending on  the specific policy pursued and whether developed countries are willing to  exercise leadership. However, there are risks in any equitable position on climate  change (including loss and damage, climate finance, mitigation targets and  adaptation). Three points are worth bearing in mind.  First, if we bear in mind that humanity as a whole may not emit more than half a  trillion tons of carbon if it is to have a 50% chance of not triggering a 2°C world,  and if we also bear in mind that the Paris Agreement aims for an even more  stringent target (Allen et al. 2009, pp.1163-1166; Collins and Knutti 2013, p.1033)  then proposals to allocate the remaining extraction rights to resource-rich  developing countries are likely to encounter some serious political obstacles.  First, some resource-rich developed countries—aware of this and seeking to  avoid dangerous climate change but wishing to utilize their own reserves—will  simply resist plans to allocate extraction rights to the least advantaged.  Alternatively, they might not contest any allocation of extraction rights to the least  advantaged but also will not curb their own extraction of fossil fuels. This would  maintain the flow of fossil fuels and not result in any price increase and thus not  dampen the consumption of fossil fuels. As a result, humanity will exceed the  trillion ton cumulative carbon budget and cause dangerous climate change. It is  notable, in this context, that the Paris Agreement made no further step towards  allocating specific responsibilities and limiting rights to emit greenhouse gases.In addition to this, the USA has consistently resisted attempts to appeal to  principles of historical responsibility.On the other hand, it can be argued that while some resource-rich affluent  countries will resist allocating extraction rights to developing countries they might  be less opposed to policies compensating developing countries for not using  fossil fuels in their own countries. In other words, they might support a proposal  that is similar in spirit to REDD. Building on this, it can be argued that there could  be a system whereby those in developing countries do not develop their fossil  fuels and are compensated financially for doing so where those who pay for the  compensation can include that as part of their contribution to mitigation.  This would help address the problem that faced the Yasuní-ITT Initiative—  namely the lack of sufficient funds. It would also bring it closer in nature to  existing flexibility mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism,  which is an established feature of the international climate regime. It is also  similar to other forms of paying for environmental services. The CDM is not  unproblematic and there have been some very serious shortcomings and flaws  (Caney 2010c, pp.217-218). However, it is worth considering a policy which  seeks both to mitigate climate change and which does so in ways that further  development. Furthermore, since doing so gives some flexibility to high emitting  countries it might be welcomed by them.  In short, then, while there is a political risk the precedents of the REDD and CDM  suggest that it is not insuperable. A scheme for stranding assets in which those  who abstain from using them receive compensation for that (distributed equitably  among those affected) and in which those who pay for the fund have that  included as part of their mitigation commitments is worth serious consideration as  an equitable and feasible way of addressing climate change in a way that  respects the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and  Respective Capabilities.  Second, if the policies towards stranding fossil fuel assets adopt the different  criteria analyzed earlier in this paper then, as noted, this will lead to  differentiation between non-Annex I countries. As such, some countries are likely  to resist the fragmentation of Annex I and the unity of the G77. As evidence for  this, it is worth noting that some opposed using Equity Reference Framework  indicators “as a means to differentiate between developing countries” (Ad Hoc  Working Group on the Durban Platform 2013, p.4). To give one important  example, India has objected to the differentiation among non-Annex I countries  that an ERF would entail.68 The point is well-expressed by Navroz Dubash and Lavanya Rajamani in “A Map and a Compass for  Climate Talks,” The Hindu 23 July (2014). They write:  “Indeed, India, with some other like-minded developing countries, has actively rejected an Africa Group  proposal for an “Equity Reference Framework,” which has focused on how burdens may be equitably shared  given differing historical responsibilities, development needs and current capabilities. Operationalising this  framework would require a multilateral assessment of national contributions. India has proven suspicious of  any assessment, even though the use of criteria proposed by the Africa Group can only work in India’s  favour. In the political and legal context of the ongoing negotiations, a rigorous and consequential  multilateral assessment process is the solitary mechanism under discussion that could potentially assess  and perhaps even deliver equity in the distribution of climate burdens as well as adequacy of contributions  by countries in relation to the agreed 2°C temperature goal. India’s rejection of an assessment process  In reply: although breaking down the binary division between developed and  developing countries might encounter some resistance it is not clear how much  longer this binary framework can last in the UNFCCC process. The emergence of  other groupings like BASIC might signal an evolution from the old divisions found  in the Kyoto Protocol.  A third point, as was noted above, although stranding fossil fuel assets  necessarily raises questions of distributive justice those are not the only  considerations. More generally, one can distinguish between two perspectives.One might be called “duty-bearer justice”: this seeks to ensure that the path to a  zero carbon world shares burdens equitably, with due respect to the right to  develop and honoring the principles of common but differentiated responsibility.  The focus of this paper has been on what this might mean in the context of  stranding fossil fuel assets. However, there is a second perspective—what might  be termed “harm-avoidance justice”: this seeks to prevent harm. In this case it  prioritizes preventing dangerous climate change.  Ideally, policies honor both sets of considerations. However, in practice, policy  makers may be forced to strike a balance. It is thus important to adopt a policy to  stranding fossil fuel assets that does not preclude reaching an effective climate  regime that succeeds in avoiding dangerous climatic changes. At the same time,  it is important to ensure that the transition to a safe climate and a zero carbon  world honors duties to the world’s poorest (Caney 2016).  sacrifices an opportunity to operationalise equity and risks allowing developed countries off the hook”  (Dubash and Rajamani 2014).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 950 million people, is the most  electricity-poor region in the world. More than 600 million people lack access to  electricity, and millions more are connected to an unreliable grid that does not  meet their daily energy service needs. Most countries in this region have  electricity access rates of about 20%, and two out of three people lack access to  modern energy services. The average annual electricity consumption in the sub-  Saharan residential sector is 488 kilowatt hours (kWh) per capita—equivalent to  about 5% the consumption of the United States. The International Energy  Agency (IEA) estimates that electricity demand in sub-Saharan Africa grew by  about 35% from 2000 to 2012 to reach 352 terawatt hours (TWh), and it  forecasts the total demand for electricity in Africa to increase at an average rate  of 4% a year through 2040. Demand estimates that include self-generation, such  as diesel generators, report even higher figures: 423 TWh in 2010. To meet this  growing demand, the region will need to significantly expand its installed  generation capacity and make extensive upgrades to the power grid. At the  current pace of electrification and population growth, more than half a billion  people are expected to remain without access to electricity by 2040, and full  electricity access in the region is not estimated to be accomplished until 2080.  Hence, sub-Saharan Africa is burdened with a complex and persistent electricity  gap.  The electricity gap refers to both the supply-demand mismatch in grid-connected  regions and the lack of access in off-grid regions. Closing the electricity gap in  sub-Saharan Africa is a multidimensional challenge with important implications  for how to frame the region’s energy problem as a whole.  Sub-Saharan Africa has high income and wealth inequality, which leads to vast  differences in consumers’ desire and willingness to pay for electricity. Its  countries display large disparities in electricity costs, with South Africa and  Zambia among the lowest, and Djibouti and Gabon among the highest. Access to  electricity is also highly unequal, even among people who are connected to the  grid. Some people cannot afford to consume electricity despite being connected.  Therefore, they cannot consume enough electricity to make use of modern  energy services. They may also suffer disproportionately high levels of service  interruption, with no ability to depend on expensive on-site diesel generators like  wealthier people in the same region. The electronic appliances the region’s  consumers will purchase—many for the first time—will be more efficient than the  current stock in many wealthier economies. Hence, the pace, level, and profile of  electricity demand in sub-Saharan Africa will evolve differently. There are  technological, geographical, cultural, and social distinctions that suggest the   region should define its own target standard of living and type of energy services  to be pursued, rather than comparing itself with wealthier countries.  Persistent electricity scarcity has crippled the region’s economic growth and  prevented it from attaining several of its health and education development goals.  Causes of this scarcity include lack of generation capacity to supply power to  grid-connected regions, absence of proper grid infrastructure to deliver this  power, regulatory impediments to providing steady revenue to maintain and  invest in new generation capacity, and dispersity of population in remote areas.  As of 2012, sub-Saharan Africa’s installed generation capacity was a mere 90  GW—about 0.1 kW per capita—in stark contrast with wealthier economies that  have installed capacities ranging from 1.0 to 3.3 kW per capita. The region’s  inability to provide reliable electricity has led to prolific growth of inefficient and  expensive on-site self-generation in industrial, commercial, and even residential  sectors.  This lack of systematic planning for the power sector has resulted in a system  with high transmission and distribution losses (averaging 18% across the region  when South Africa is excluded), and created a high dependence on large dams  and expensive diesel plants. The region’s dependence on fossil fuel plants  creates a multifaceted problem of supply and price variability, with fuel producers  curtailing supply under low prices and consumers suffering economic losses  during periods of high prices. In addition, climate change is projected to have a  substantial impact on the reliability of hydropower resources in sub-Saharan  Africa. Erratic rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts can reduce hydroelectric  output and force extended outages. While the region contributes the least to  greenhouse gas emissions, it is most vulnerable to climate change impacts such  as droughts and reduced agricultural yields.  This complex challenge presents an opportunity for sub-Saharan countries to  design low-fuel, low-carbon power systems based on wind, geothermal, and  solar technologies and to use responsive and efficient demand management  strategies.  The region is home to abundant fossil and renewable energy sources. The  technical potential for generation capacity is estimated at about 10,000 GW of  solar power, 350 GW of hydroelectricity, and 400 GW of natural gas, totaling  more than 11,000 GW. The limiting factors in the region’s electricity development  are effective technical, financing, and policy mechanisms to enable the  development of these resources. In addition, the region’s lack of grid  infrastructure can be transformed into an opportunity to lead the way toward  better-designed, more efficient, sustainable power systems without being  hindered by legacy carbon-intensive assets. Both private and public stakeholders  have a window of opportunity to determine how best to coordinate energy  solutions at the point of use, mini-grid, and centralized grid levels. Mechanisms  9 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  should be put in place to facilitate grid extension and micro-grid deployment in  order to reach unconnected regions. Utility and tariff structures must be fair,  stable, and sustainable to ensure cost-effective and reliable delivery to end  users, as well as proper maintenance of valuable energy infrastructure.  Filling the electricity gap with renewable sources will entail economic and  environmental trade-offs because of the region’s unique combination of  challenges and opportunities. A promising way to facilitate this development is  through regional power pools that allow countries to aggregate resources and  extend grids across national borders, capitalizing on regional diversity in  resources and demand. Four regional power pools already exist, but only about  7% of electricity is traded across international borders, mostly through the South  African Power Pool. Facilitating increased use of the region’s four power pools  could save more than $50 billion in capital investments in the power sector.  Power pools could also facilitate additional strategies to incorporate large  amounts of variable renewable generation such as the use of existing reservoir  hydropower to provide storage, the deployment of novel chemical and  mechanical storage technologies, and the adoption of widespread demand  response programs across the region.  Designing, testing, and assessing different expansion scenarios for sub-Saharan  Africa is paramount to finding the optimal combination of supply, transmission,  storage, and demand-side resources to fuel development and growth for the  coming decades. Countries need to develop and adopt a host of data-driven  integrated modeling tools for systems-level planning and operation at an  unprecedented scale. Governments need to partner with academic institutions  and private sector stakeholders to produce data in the quality and quantity  required to provide decision makers with the right inputs for these modeling tools.  In this report, we design an open-access power system model and analyze  optimal pathways for expanding supply capacity in two case study countries:  Kenya and Nigeria. We compare the average costs of various expansion  scenarios for achieving reliable and affordable power by 2035 and explore issues  such as integration of variable renewable resources, improvements in electricity  access, impacts of reliability, and the role of decentralized energy resources.  The case studies show that renewables are now cost competitive and that fuels  such as natural gas can play a role in providing system flexibility until grid  storage costs decline. The analysis shows that fuel choices should be considered  cautiously—particularly coal, which is shown to be a costly pathway to  electrification in Kenya and Nigeria. The case studies also show that the scale of  centralized generation expansion required to meet moderate load growth by  2035 is significant compared with historical investments in power systems and  the rate of system expansion in many countries in the region. Current investment  in sub-Saharan electricity systems is about US$8 billion a year. This is   inadequate to overcome the existing infrastructure challenge, to expand access  and coverage, and to meet the growth in demand. The model estimates that  Nigeria will have to install at least an additional 36 GW by 2035 to keep up with  grid-based load growth alone, and Kenya will have to install at least 17 GW. This  is about five times the current operational capacity in each country. Therefore,  achieving full electricity access will require combining many pathways and  strategies, such as synergies between centralized and distributed energy  systems, bolstered financial support and investments, and improved institutional  capacity and management.  Though challenging, these results reveal opportunities to increase the use of  clean energy and build intra- and international cooperation in Africa. While  models only illustrate opportunities, the signs are hopeful that if energy access  and sustainable development are raised as continent-wide priorities, Africa is  primed for an energy transformation. A number of important conclusions emerge  from this assessment.  Key observations are the following:  • While sub-Saharan Africa has significant fossil fuel resources, many of which  are the focus of domestic and international “resource races,” investments in  and use of fossil fuels should be judicious given that   the exploitation of fossil fuels, even in energy-limited countries, often  comes at the expense of the development of sustainable energy sources;  and   decades of experience show that fossil fuel energy development does  little to increase energy access, which is lower in sub-Saharan Africa than  in any other region.  • Africa has exceptional solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass resource  potential, both on a per capita basis and in terms of resource diversity. Africa  could thus achieve high levels of energy services with very low carbon  emissions.  • Advances in smart grids and information and communication technologies  (ICTs) will enable the region to take full advantage of its exceptional  renewable resources.  • Successfully integrating large shares of variable renewable resources will  require high grid flexibility, currently hindered by the difficulty of  operationalizing regional power pools and the high cost of energy storage.  • Operational power pools combined with strategic policies and actionable  targets could quicken the pace of electrification across the region.  11 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  • As these challenges are resolved, fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, will  likely remain a part of the region’s transition to a low-carbon electricity grid.  These observations lead to the following actionable conclusions:  • Lack of data is hindering analysis of future grid designs in many countries in  the region. The development of robust planning tools that have relatively low  data requirements will permit the widest vetting of renewable energy projects  based on their energy, social, and environmental costs and benefits.  • Investment in renewable energy is proving a more sustainable and costeffective  path to meeting Africa’s dual challenges of economic empowerment  and energy access.  • A clean energy path benefits significantly from well-functioning regional  power pools. National efforts to develop clean energy transition plans and  policies aligning on-grid and off-grid energy service delivery are key, but  added regional work—via regional power pools—can speed progress on  meeting the joint goals of national and regional energy sufficiency, as well as  full energy access across Africa.  • Worldwide, too little attention has been paid to ways of coordinating and  integrating off-grid, mini-grid, and large utility-scale power systems. For  African countries and individuals, the benefits of such a systems nexus can  be transformative.   Text Box 1: An electricity grid lexicon  A number of industry terms related to the technical, economic, management, and  environmental elements of the power system are defined here.  Capacity factor: the ratio of a power plant’s actual generation output over a period of  time to its potential output (also known as nameplate capacity) if the power plant were to  operate at full nameplate capacity continuously over the same period of time.  Captive generation: localized sources of power such as diesel generators set up by  individuals or small communities for personal use. It is also known as self-generation.  Contingency reserves: extra generation that is kept available in the case of generator or  transmission outage.  Curtailment: the reduction in a power plant’s scheduled output due to excess generation  and transmission congestion. Typically there is no compensation for the reduction in  output, and it may decrease the plant’s profitability.  Demand response: the shifting of loads by getting end-users to shut off appliances and  larger industrial machines at peak times and to run those machines at specific off-peak  hours instead, changing the load profile to match the generation supply.  Demand uncertainty: all power systems are planned with a degree of uncertainty of the  load, and the demand forecasts are refined closer to the day of operation, within hours  and minutes.  Dispatchable power: electricity from generators that can adjust their power output  according to grid operator requests. Dispatchable plants have the ability to dispatch their  power over time frames from minutes to one hour.  Distributed generation: small-scale energy technologies (usually modular generators)  to produce electricity close to load centers and end users  Electricity grid: an interconnected network that delivers electricity to consumers. The  power is delivered from large generators through long-distance high-voltage transmission  lines to distribution stations where the power is stepped down to lower voltages and  connected to individual customers. This design is referred to as a centralized grid.  Energy balance: the match between supply and demand that grid operators must  maintain at all times in order to avoid electricity blackouts. Achieving this balance  requires dispatchable and flexible generators and storage.  Energy efficiency: the delivery of more services for the same energy input or the  delivery of the same services for less energy input. This is a way of managing and  restraining the growth in energy consumption.  Energy storage: various technologies such as batteries, pumped hydropower, and  flywheels that can store electrical energy and smooth electricity supply to enable constant  energy balance in a grid.  Flexible generation: the ability of power plants to ramp power production up and down  13 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  quickly and efficiently to respond to changes in energy demand.  Flexible transmission: the ability of electricity networks to limit bottlenecks in power  transmission and to allow for energy balancing in a larger area by drawing on neighboring  networks.  Fossil fuels: nonrenewable sources of energy that have developed from buried organic  matter in the earth over millions of years. They include oil, natural gas, and coal.  Grid flexibility: the ability of a power system to respond to changes in demand and  supply—is a characteristic of all power systems. Flexibility is especially critical with higher  levels of grid-connected variable renewable energy (primarily, wind and solar).  Intermittent power: the variable output of renewable sources such as solar and wind,  owing to changing weather conditions. Their intermittent power supply requires storage  and/or fast-acting generators to smooth the output.  Levelized cost of electricity: the net present value of the unit cost (capital and variable)  of electricity over the lifetime of a generating asset. It is used as a proxy for the average  price that the generating asset must receive in a market to break even over its lifetime.  Load duration curve: electricity demand sorted in descending order of magnitude over a  time period.  Mini-grid/micro-grid: any grid that is not linked to the main central grid in the country in  which it is located.  Net load: the remaining electricity demand that must be supplied by the conventional  generation fleet after all of the variable renewable energy has been consumed.  Non-spinning reserves: the additional generating capacity that is not currently  connected to the system but can be brought online after a short delay using fast-start  dispatchable generators or through imports.  Operating reserves: the generating capacity available to the system operator within a  short interval of time to meet demand in case a generator goes down or there is another  disruption to the supply. It is made up of spinning and non-spinning reserves.  Ramps: a generation plant’s rate of change of dispatchable power to follow changes in  demand. A plant may ramp up to respond to rises in demand or failure of other  generators, or ramp down during low load hours.  Renewable energy: energy that is derived from natural processes and constantly  replenished. In its various forms, it derives directly or indirectly from the sun or from heat  generated deep within the earth. It includes energy generated from solar, wind, biomass,  geothermal, hydropower, and ocean resources, as well as biofuels and hydrogen derived  from renewable resources.  Renewables integration: high penetration of renewables on the grid presents  challenges because conventional grid designs are built to transmit power from large  dispatchable and controllable generators to loads. To avoid blackouts, energy generated  and consumed on the grid must be equal at every instant. Wind and solar generators are   not dispatchable and controllable as they depend on weather patterns. Therefore, a grid  with large amounts of renewables will require storage and fast-acting dispatchable  generators to maintain grid balance.  Spinning reserves: the additional generating capacity available to grid operators to meet  unforeseen changes in demand by increasing the power output of generators that are  already connected to the power system.  Turndown: the use of generators at low output levels. Dispatchable generators may be  required to turn down to low output for a period of time and must also have the ability to  increase its generation quickly again.  15 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  1. INTRODUCTION  Sub-Saharan Africa faces two major energy challenges: inadequate energy  access and climate change. It must attain 100% electricity access and develop  clean energy systems to mitigate climate change impacts. It is the most  electricity-poor region in the world: more than 600 million people lack access to  electricity, and several million people are connected to an unreliable grid that  does not meet their daily energy service needs. Most countries in this region  have average electricity access rates of about 20%, and two out of three people  lack access to modern energy services. Demand estimates that include selfgeneration,  such as diesel generators, in sub-Saharan Africa report electricity  demand to be 423 TWh in 2010 (Castellano et al., 2015). The International  Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that electricity demand in sub-Saharan Africa  grew by about 45% from 2000 to 2012 and expects the total demand for  electricity in Africa to increase at an average rate of 4% a year until 2040 (IEA,  2014). To meet this demand, the region must significantly expand its installed  generation capacity and make extensive upgrades to its power grid. With the  current pace of electrification and population growth, more than half a billion  people are expected to remain without access to electricity by 2040 (IEA, 2016)  and full electricity access in the region is only estimated to be accomplished by  2080 (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). Hence, sub-Saharan Africa is burdened with  a complex and persistent electricity gap.  The challenge of closing the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa while limiting  greenhouse gas emissions is the context that frames this report. The report sets  out to review the generation potential available from different energy sources and  then looks at the challenges and opportunities presented by different electricity  expansion pathways. The work includes models of the electricity systems in two  countries: Nigeria and Kenya, in which the least-cost investment pathway is  assessed under a number of different scenarios. The report focuses on  explaining the technical and institutional challenges that characterize different  energy pathways and in this respect the report is intended as a guide to  advocates and policy-makers.  This work is based on a six-month review of the literature on electricity systems  and options in sub-Saharan Africa as well as modeling efforts assessing Kenya  and Nigeria. This report (Part 1) on closing the electricity gap in sub-Saharan  Africa is intended to complement another Oxfam report exploring the particular  challenges related to promoting energy access and addressing energy poverty.  That report, referenced as Part 2, can be found where this report was  downloaded.   UNDERSTANDING SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA’S  ELECTRICITY GAP  Sub-Saharan Africa faces an electricity gap in two senses: a mismatch between  supply and demand in grid-connected regions, and a lack of access in off-grid  regions. Closing sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity gap is a multidimensional  challenge with important implications for how to frame the region’s energy  problem as a whole.  Sub-Saharan Africa has high income and wealth inequality (IEA, 2014), which  results in vast differences in consumers’ desire and willingness to pay for  electricity. The cost of electricity also varies widely within the region, with South  Africa and Zambia being among the lowest and Djibouti and Gabon being among  the highest. Even among people who are connected to the grid, there are  disparities in consumption. Despite being connected to the grid, some people  cannot afford to consume electricity and thus cannot make use of modern energy  services. They may also suffer disproportionately higher levels of service  interruption, with no ability to depend on expensive on-site diesel generators like  wealthier people in the same region.  Also, the electronic appliances the region’s consumers will purchase—many for  the first time—will be more efficient than the current stock in many wealthier  economies. Hence, the pace, level, and profile of electricity demand in the region  will evolve differently. There are technological, geographical, cultural, and social  distinctions that suggest sub-Saharan Africa should define its own target  standard of living and type of energy services to be pursued, rather than  comparing itself with wealthier countries.  In sub-Saharan Africa, the average annual electricity consumption is 488 kWh  per capita—equivalent to about 5% of U.S. per capita consumption (World Bank,  2014). This average has been pushed up by South Africa’s high electricity  access rates. When South Africa is excluded, annual electricity consumption is  only about 150 kWh per capita (World Bank, 2014). These estimates, however,  may be conservative owing to the latent demand that remains unmet as a result  of lack of grid access in rural areas, and unreliable grids and epileptic power  supply in urban grid-connected areas. The prolific use of expensive on-site diesel  generators indicates significant latent demand, but it is difficult to accurately  measure and account for these generators in the region.  17 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 1: Rates of access to electricity and total populations without  access to electricity  Source: IEA, 2014.  Sub-Saharan Africa has a unique opportunity to expand its generation capacity  without exacerbating climate change owing to its abundant renewable resources.  At the November 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Morocco,  47 members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (many of which are in sub-  Saharan Africa) pledged to strive to achieve 100% domestic renewable energy  production as rapidly as possible (Climate Vulnerable Forum, 2016). Renewable  energy is key to solving both the region’s energy access and climate change  challenges. The limiting factor in the region’s electricity development is effective  technical, financing, and policy mechanisms to enable the region to develop  these resources. Its lack of grid infrastructure can be transformed into a  leadership opportunity to develop better-designed and more efficient power  systems without being hindered by legacy carbon-intensive assets. Governments  and private sector stakeholders have made concerted efforts to promote the use  of micro-grids and other distributed energy resources to reach unelectrified  regions, and these efforts have inadvertently resulted in the juxtaposition of  centralized and distributed technologies as opposing efforts. The two should be   regarded, however, as complementary. When centralized and distributed grids  are built with the intent to integrate and connect them in the future, they can have  strategic synergies. Effective frameworks must be put in place to facilitate this.  Finally, utility and tariff structures can be reformed to reflect fair and stable rates  that ensure reliable delivery to end-users.  The region will face significant economic, environmental, political, and  operational challenges and trade-offs on the way to achieving these goals. To  understand the scale of these challenges, we designed an open-access power  system model to analyze optimal pathways for expanding supply capacity in two  case study countries: Kenya and Nigeria. This analysis compares the average  costs of various expansion scenarios for achieving reliable and affordable power  by 2035 and explores the roles of renewables in the electricity mix under various  demand growth, and policy conditions.  DEFINING ENERGY ACCESS  One of the challenges in addressing the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa is  that grid connection rates there do not present a holistic picture of actual access  to modern energy services. It is common for countries to have a high rate of grid  connection combined with a low quality of electricity supply (see Nigeria in Figure  12).  Energy access is intertwined with complex socioeconomic factors that cannot be  measured using a binary “connected/not connected” approach. Measuring who  has access to energy, particularly electricity, requires a holistic understanding of  the quality of access and how it affects socioeconomic development. It calls for  answering questions such as, Is there a connection to the central grid? How  affordable are the grid connection and its electricity supply? How reliable and  predictable is the electricity supply? How safe is the electricity supply? In  response to this complexity, the World Bank proposed a multi-tier framework for  defining and measuring access to energy (Bhatia & Angelou, 2015), based on  several principles:  1. Energy access should be measured by usability, reliability, and affordability  defined from the user’s perspective.  2. Energy access involves a spectrum of service levels experienced by  households and individuals.  3. Energy access can be achieved through a variety of technologies, so its  measure should be technology-neutral.  19 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 2: The multi-tier energy access framework  Source: Bhatia & Angelou, 2015.   2. RESOURCE POTENTIAL IN  SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  Sub-Saharan Africa has abundant renewable and fossil energy resources that  have yet to be developed to meet its electricity demand. Its technical generation  capacity potential is estimated to be 11,000 gigawatts (GW), largely from  renewables (Figure 3).  POTENTIAL RENEWABLE AND FOSSIL  RESOURCES  All of the countries across the region have high solar potential, totaling about  10,000 GW, and the technical potential for solar photovoltaic alone has been  estimated at 6,500 terrawatt hours (TWh) a year (Cartwright, 2015). Most of its  coastal countries have high wind potential, totaling about 109 GW. The East  Africa Rift Valley offers an estimated 15 GW of geothermal capacity, mainly in  Ethiopia and Kenya. Because the region is home to the Congo and the Nile  Rivers, among the world’s longest rivers, it also has some of the greatest  hydropower resources in the world. Its exploitable hydropower is estimated at  about 350 GW, located mainly in Angola, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of  Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, and Gabon. Its fossil energy resources include recent oil  and gas discoveries, and it has about 400 GW of natural gas potential. Coal  resources are estimated at 300 GW, mainly in Botswana, Mozambique, and  South Africa (Castellano et al., 2015). Notably, however, some low-access  countries like Angola and Nigeria have a well-developed petroleum production  infrastructure that has not translated into a reliable electricity supply (Figure 1).  21 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 3: Abundant renewable energy potential in Sub-Saharan Africa  Source: Cartwright, 2015.  Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of solar irradiation in Africa, highlighting  high-potential areas of concentrated solar power and photovoltaic development.  Figure 4: Solar irradiation across Africa  Source: GeoSUN Africa, 2011.   Figure 5 shows that the largest electricity generation potential exists in Central  and Southern Africa, comprising mostly hydropower, coal, and natural gas.  Geothermal potential exists mainly in Eastern Africa, in Ethiopia, Kenya, and  Tanzania. This concentration of resources in different zones highlights the  importance of regional cooperation, especially because some of the regions with  the greatest regional generation potential do not have the highest demand  (Castellano et al., 2015).  Figure 5: Electricity generation potential (GW) by technology  Source: (Castellano et al., 2015).  RENEWABLE ENERGY ZONES  Successfully exploiting sub-Saharan Africa’s renewable energy resources will  demand whole-systems thinking. Although the region has abundant wind and  solar resources, high-quality resources are unevenly distributed geographically,  so promoting the supply of clean, low-cost wind and solar energy to all countries  will require effective regional collaboration and grid interconnection (Wu et al.,  2016). Differences in the operational characteristics of various generation  technologies can be complementary, thereby reducing the need for one-for-one  backup generation and storage for renewables. For example, increased wind and  solar capacity in countries like South Africa and Tanzania can be used along with  existing hydropower generation in countries such as DRC, Ethiopia, Malawi,  Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia to provide balancing services to regional  grids. At the same time, solar and wind generation may reduce the risk of inter-annual  and climate-driven variation in hydropower availability. Many of the high-potential  renewable zones are close to existing transmission infrastructure and  23 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  major load centers, thus requiring lower transmission upgrade and extension  costs (Figures 6 and 7). These synergies can be exploited. Dual land-use  strategies, such as the combination of agricultural land and wind development,  will prevent potential conflicts that come with land access. Wind and solar  generation sites can be co-located in order to reduce costs, maximize  transmission efficiencies, and minimize ecological impacts (Wu et al., 2016).

ELECTRICITY DEMAND IN  SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  Data on demand for electricity in sub-Saharan Africa are often unreliable or  unavailable, but the data that are available show that demand growing quickly  and a large portion remains latent due to low access levels in the region.  DEMAND ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS  The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that electricity demand in the  region grew by about 35% from 2000 to 2012 to reach 352 TWh. Currently,  average per capita electricity consumption in sub-Saharan Africa is 488 kWh a  year, the lowest rate of any major world region. By comparison, in North Africa,  where the electricity access rate is over 90%, electricity demand increased by  more than 80% from 2000 to 2012 reaching 1,500 kWh per capita. The greatest  demand in sub-Saharan Africa is in Nigeria and South Africa, which together  account for about 40% of total demand (IEA, 2014).  The IEA forecasts that total demand for electricity in Africa will increase at an  average rate of 4% a year through 2040 to reach 1,570 TWh, including captive  power estimates (Figure 8). McKinsey’s power sector report on sub-Saharan  Africa estimates electricity demand at 423 TWh in 2010 and also projects an  annual growth rate of about 4% through 2040 (Castellano et al., 2015).  Discrepancies in estimates of historical electricity demand, particularly owing to  unreliable data on captive power and self-generation, add to the uncertainty of  demand projections, which are so important in deciding the future design of the  region’s power system. This is why the open source modeling tool in section 8  has been designed to estimate power system capacity expansion pathways  despite poor data availability and access.   Figure 8: Expected growth in electricity demand in sub-Saharan Africa  Source: Castellano et al., 2015.  FUTURE DEMAND PROFILES  As African countries develop, their electricity demand profiles will change.  Current demand profiles show that in most of Africa, demand for electricity peaks  in the evening. The shape of this demand profile—particularly the size of peak  demand relative to average demand—is important for capacity planning. If peak  demand is much greater than average demand, more generation capacity will  have to be installed, even if that capacity is used for only a few hours a day when  peak demand occurs. The need for “peaker plants” greatly impacts the  economics of the grid.  Not only the size but also the timing of peak demand is important because of the  hourly availability of variable renewable resources. Peak demand in Kenya, for  example, and other counties in sub-Saharan Africa occurs in the evening (Figure  9). Solar power is not available in the evenings, so solar installed capacity will not  contribute to the peak capacity required to meet demand. Solar, therefore, may  be less favorable than other resources that can be available during all hours of  the day. This is why storage technologies play a major role in deploying  renewable energy. Batteries can, for example, store solar energy during peak  production times in the afternoon and discharge it in the evening during peak  demand hours.    As the manufacturing and service sectors develop in the region and the shape of  the demand profile evolves, peak demand hours may shift to earlier in the day,  during peak solar production. Such a shift would greatly improve the grid value of  solar energy and make it more optimal in system planning.  The U.S. state of California has a power system that integrates large amounts of  non-dispatchable energy; its experience thus suggests some of the challenges  sub-Saharan Africa may face in integrating solar PV and wind. The duck chart  shown in Figure 10 shows the net load of the California electricity grid over a  day. Each line represents the net load, equal to the normal load minus wind and  PV generation. The “belly” of the duck curve represents the period of lowest net  load: the afternoon, when PV generation is at a maximum. The belly of the curve  grows as PV installations are projected to increase between 2012 and 2020. As  the sun sets in the evening and solar generation falls, the net load increases.  This results in steep ramps in output from other dispatchable generators, usually  thermal plants.  The duck chart shows how solar PV could potentially generate more electricity  than the grid can consume. During overgeneration conditions, the supply of  power exceeds demand and requires flexibility, such as demand response, grid  storage, or, ultimately, a reduction in output from conventional generation plants.  When conventional generation cannot be backed down any further to  accommodate the oversupply of variable generation, it leads to curtailment.  Curtailment occurs when a system operator decreases the electricity output from  a wind or PV plant below what it would normally produce. For wind generators,  this is performed by changing the blade angle. For solar plants, generation is  curtailed by either reducing output from its inverter or disconnecting the plant   altogether. Curtailment raises several challenges. It requires a system operator  to have physical control of the generator, which is typically the case for large  renewable power plants but not for smaller systems, particularly distributed or  rooftop systems. Curtailment also reduces the economic and environmental  benefits of solar and wind plants because each unit of curtailed energy  represents a unit of energy unsold and a unit of fossil fuel generation not  displaced. As the amount of curtailment increases, the overall benefits of  additional solar may drop to the point where additional installations are not worth  the cost (Denholm et al., 2015). This is why grid flexibility is critical to sub-  Saharan Africa’s transition to a low-carbon grid.  Figure 10: Changes in the net load on the California grid at high rates of  renewable penetration  Source: Denholm et al., 2015.  29 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  4. ELECTRICITY GENERATION  Sub-Saharan Africa’s power grid has an installed generation capacity of about 90  GW—about 0.1 kW per capita, in stark contrast with wealthier economies that  have installed capacities ranging from 1 to 3 kW per capita (IEA, 2014). Half of  the region’s capacity is located in South Africa, and 13 GW are located in Nigeria  (Figure 11). Only about 6 GW (or 40%) is operational owing to poor maintenance  and fuel shortages in Nigeria. The installed capacity for many sub-Saharan  African countries is less than 1 GW (IEA, 2014). Excluding South Africa, the  entire installed generation capacity of sub-Saharan Africa is only 28 GW,  equivalent to that of Argentina (Castellano et al., 2015).  Figure 11: Installed grid-based capacity (GW) in sub-Saharan Africa, 2000  and 2012  Source: IEA, 2014.  The region’s dearth of generation capacity is partly due to its low level of  investment in power systems, which currently accounts for about 0.5% of its  gross domestic product (GDP) (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). According to a  recent report, sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to install about 1 terawatt  (TW) of generation capacity from a range of different technology options,  excluding solar (Castellano et al., 2015). About 20% of the region’s current  generation is from hydropower and more than 70% is from fossil fuels  (Cartwright, 2015). This dependence on fossil fuels is at odds with resource  potential estimates that show the abundance of renewable resources in the  region.   The installed utility-scale generation capacity and mix of each region is as  follows:  • Southern Africa has more installed grid generation capacity than the rest of  sub-Saharan Africa. Of Southern Africa’s total 58 GW, 80% is in South Africa  alone. The rest of Southern Africa has only 12 GW, mostly hydropower with  some coal, oil, and gas. South Africa gets 85% of its generation capacity from  coal and the rest from oil distillate (6%), hydropower (5%), and nuclear (4%).  It is the only African country with nuclear power plants (with a capacity of  about 2 GW). In 2012, the average cost of grid generation across Southern  Africa was about $55 per MWh, owing to the high use of low-cost coal and  hydropower (IEA, 2014).  • West Africa’s grid generation capacity is estimated at about 20 GW. Of this  capacity, more than 50% is gas generation (mostly in Nigeria), about 30% is  oil distillate, and about 20% is hydropower. Some countries, like Benin,  Burkina Faso, and Niger, import most of their electricity. In 2012, the average  cost of generation was about $140 per MWh, owing to dependence on gas  and oil generation (IEA, 2014).  • East Africa has grid generation capacity of about 8 GW, of which 50%  comes from hydropower, 45% from oil distillate, and the rest from geothermal  and gas. About 250 MW of geothermal resources lie mainly in Kenya. In  2012, the average cost of generation was $110 per MWh, despite the  region’s inexpensive hydropower generation, owing to the high use of  expensive oil generation plants (IEA, 2014).  • Central Africa has the lowest grid generation capacity in sub-Saharan Africa,  at 4 GW, composed mainly of 65% hydropower, 15% gas, and 20% oil  distillate. In 2012, the average cost of generation was around $95 per MWh,  owing to the low cost of hydropower (IEA, 2014).  INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS  Electric utilities in sub-Saharan Africa are typically vertically integrated—that is,  they control all levels of the supply chain: generation, transmission, and  distribution. Because of the poor performance of the power sector in the region,  however, many countries have attempted to unbundle their electricity utilities to  allow participation by independent power producers (IPPs). IPPs are entities,  usually private, that generate and sell electricity to utilities and end users. Ghana,  Nigeria, and Uganda have had some success in this area. Nonetheless, as of  2014, 21 countries in the region still had state-owned and vertically integrated  utilities with no private sector participation, precluding IPPs. Some countries  remained vertically integrated but still introduced IPPs.  31 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Currently 18 sub-Saharan countries have IPPs, with a cumulative capacity of 6.8  GW. These IPPs range in size from a few megawatts to 600 MW. The  overwhelming majority of IPP capacity (82%) is thermal; 18% is fueled by  renewables. The presence of IPPs can help reduce the perception of risk in  investing in power systems in the region and encourage private investment. To  succeed, IPPs require favorable local investment climates, clear policy and  regulatory frameworks, local availability of cost-competitive fuels, and effective  planning, procurement, and contracting practices (Eberhard et al., 2016).  SELF-GENERATION  Installed capacity estimates in the region are appallingly low compared with the  resource potential, and the situation is even worse than those estimates indicate.  Installed capacity and grid presence does not guarantee that people have access  to electricity. In Nigeria, for example, abundant fossil energy potential and the  development of petroleum-producing infrastructure have not increased reliable  connection to the electric grid (Figure 12).  Sub-Saharan Africa’s inability to provide reliable electricity has led to the prolific  growth of inefficient and expensive on-site self-generation by industrial,  commercial, and even residential consumers, reaching up 10% of the region’s  generation capacity. This has increased the cost and risk of doing business in  sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of reliable electricity has resulted in economic losses of  about 2% of the region’s GDP and about 5% of annual sales of its firms  (Castellano et al., 2015). In Nigeria, 85% of firms use a back-up generator  (Cartwright, 2015). These back-up generators are expensive, costing about  300% more than electricity from the grid (Foster & Steinbuks, 2009). This prolific  use shows the region’s appetite for electricity and willingness to pay for it.  Text Box 2: The dangers of onsite generators  On-site generators are usually noisy, pollute the living and working environments of  communities, and pose significant risks of fire and respiratory illnesses. Energy poverty,  both for primary uses such as cooking and for electricity, creates significant health  threats. About 600,000 premature deaths in Africa can be attributed to household air  pollution from the burning of solid fuels for cooking, while household diesel generators  increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and fires.  CURRENT CHALLENGES  The electricity sector in the region presents a unique set of challenges. While  sub-Saharan Africa contributes the least of any global region to greenhouse gas  emissions, it is most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as droughts and  reduced agricultural yields (Kang et al., 2009). Erratic rainfall patterns and  prolonged droughts can reduce hydroelectric output and force extended outages  (Foster & Steinbuks, 2009). The following challenges are priority targets for  reform in sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity sector, with the aim of reaching  affordable energy access and sustainability goals across the region.  • Lack of system capacity. The region’s persistent electricity scarcity has  crippled economic growth and prevented it from attaining several of its health  and education development goals (IEA, 2014). Causes of this scarcity include  lack of generation capacity for grid-connected regions, absence of proper grid  infrastructure to deliver generated power, poor maintenance of generation  33 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  plants, regulatory challenges that prevent a steady flow of revenue to  maintain and invest in new generation capacity, and the dispersal of  population in remote areas. This lack of systematic planning for the power  sector has resulted in a system with high transmission and distribution losses  (averaging 18% across the region when South Africa is excluded) (IEA,  2014), and created a high dependence on large dams and expensive diesel  plants.  • Poor sector management. Reforming the energy utilities and their regulation  to improve their operational efficiency and promote regional cooperation is  key to closing the electricity gap. The region spends billions of dollars on  utility losses and petroleum subsidies, which do not benefit power sector  development (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). Since most utilities cannot  recover their costs without these subsidies, power systems development is  perceived as high risk and is thus unattractive to private investors. Therefore,  most energy investments are limited to energy commodities produced for  export, for which prices can be better guaranteed.  • High system losses. System losses in sub-Saharan Africa are double the  world average. They include technical losses from poorly maintained  transmission and distribution networks, and commercial losses from low  revenue collection. Transmission and distribution losses are estimated at  18% across the region, when South Africa is excluded (IEA, 2014). These  losses increase the generation capacity that is required to meet load, making  centralized generation uneconomical, exposing power companies to large  financial risks, and increasing end-user tariffs (Castellano et al., 2015).  • Dependence on large dams. Because of the seasonal variability of  hydropower output and the impact of prolonged droughts in the region,  reliance on large dams creates fragile power systems and increases the  financial and climate risks in the region (Kammen et al., 2015). Until now, the  environmental and financial risks of large dams have largely been evaluated  while the dams are in operation, but a recent Oxford study shows that in most  cases, even without accounting for negative externalities on the environment,  the construction costs of large dams are too high to yield positive returns on  investment. This is mostly due to cost overruns and implementation delays  (Ansar et al., 2014). The study has shed new light on long-term energy  strategies and debunked the notion that dams produce cheap power. For  example, Kariba Dam, which holds the world’s largest reservoir and accounts  for 40% of Southern Africa’s generation capacity, has been incapacitated by  ongoing droughts exacerbated by climate change. The dam, which sits on the  Zambezi River Basin, is at high risk from weather extremes, both floods and  droughts. Given that the dam supplies half of Zambia’s electricity, this  vulnerability threatens the country’s economic activities (Leslie, 2016).   • Dependence on fossil fuels. Fossil fuels pose a range of challenges. The  region has abundant natural gas reserves that are threatened by  mismanagement and systemic venting and flaring. Expanding gas  infrastructure to provide electricity will require careful management to prevent  methane leaks—this will be one of the biggest challenges of mitigating  climate change while providing electricity. The prolific use of coal in Southern  Africa has electrified the region but burdened it with significant air pollution  and public health challenges. Countries that depend heavily on the oil  industry, such as Nigeria, are affected by price changes in the international  market. The sharp fall in oil prices between July 2014 and January 2015  resulted in a 28% drop in Nigeria’s revenue (IRENA, 2015).  One way of overcoming the sector’s challenges is through regional power pools  that allow countries to aggregate resources and extend grids across national  borders to capitalize on regional diversity in resources and demand. Four  regional power pools already exist, but only about 7% of electricity is traded  across international borders, mostly through the South African Power Pool.  Facilitating increased use of the region’s four power pools could save over $50  billion in capital investments in the power sector (Castellano et al., 2015). Other  strategies to incorporate large amount of variable renewable generation include  using existing reservoir hydropower to provide storage, deploying novel chemical  and mechanical storage technologies, and adopting widespread demand  response programs.  35 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  5. SOLUTIONS TO THE  ELECTRICITY GAP  Closing sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity gap has two main components. One  component involves increasing the region’s electricity supply and determining  whether new generation capacity will come from fossil or renewable sources. The  second component involves meeting electricity demand and determining the role  of centralized and decentralized grids in increasing people’s access. These two  components are intertwined and can be made complementary using strategic  frameworks and policies.  THE FOSSIL FUEL PATH TO INCREASING SUPPLY  The main challenges of using fossil fuels to increase the supply of electricity are  price volatility and variability, local pollution, and climate change.  First, the volatility and variability of fossil fuel prices create a multifaceted  problem: importing countries face an insecure fuel supply, while price variability  causes oil and gas producers to curtail supply under low oil and gas prices and  generators to suffer high economic losses under high oil and gas prices. The  uncertainty affects the economics of energy systems, and with most countries  locked into their fuel choices for decades, it increases the risk of stranded assets  whose operating costs are no longer affordable (African Development Bank,  2013).  Text Box 3: Unstable supply in Nigeria  70% of Nigeria’s fleet of power plants rely on natural gas. Insecure and unreliable natural  gas supply incapacitates Nigeria’s generation fleet, increasing the use of private diesel  generators as backup. In 2012, more than 10 TWh of Nigeria’s electricity demand was  met by backup generators (IEA, 2014).  Second, the prevalence of subsidies in sub-Saharan Africa creates a significant  barrier to moving away from fossil fuels. Governments spend about US$21 billion  a year on fuel subsidies, including subsidies covering utility losses (Africa  Progress Panel, 2015). The vast majority of these subsidies are spent in North  Africa, as well as in Angola and Nigeria. By straining national budgets and  discouraging investment in renewable resources, the subsidies inhibit  sustainable energy development. They will eventually trap the region’s energy   investments in carbon-intensive technologies that could become stranded assets  in the event of future climate and emissions regulations. Several sub-Saharan  countries such as Angola, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda have tried to  reform their policies in recent years. In particular, Kenya successfully reformed its  electricity fuel cost subsidy by allowing an automatic pass-through of changes in  fuel cost to aid the development of domestic renewable energy (Whitley and van  der Burg, 2015). To close the electricity gap sustainably and cleanly, some of  these investments in fossil fuel subsidies may have to be channeled to  renewable energy systems.  A study of cost-optimal rural electrification options in Africa demonstrates the  impact of subsidies on electricity access. The study compared diesel generators,  solar PV, and grid extension options for off-grid areas and found that the  presence of subsidies was crucial in determining if solar PV was cost-optimal  compared with diesel. Neighboring countries (with similar geographical factors)  had different optimal choices (Figure 13), revealing how sensitive rural  electrification costs are to fuel prices. The subsidies that exist for diesel, as  shown in Figure 14, could also be directed toward supporting PV to avoid  distorting the emerging rural electrification market (Szabo et al., 2011).  Figure 13: Optimal option for off-grid electrification in Africa, comparing  diesel with solar PV  Source: Szabo et al., 2011.  37 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 14: Retail fuel prices in Africa in 2008, illustrating regions with high  fuel subsides and taxes  Source: Szabo et al., 2011.  Finally, pollution from coal-fired plants will have significant impacts on local public  health and climate change. Urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa already suffer  from high levels of air pollution owing to the prolific use of diesel generators in  residential and commercial buildings. South Africa’s Mpumalanga province,  which is home to 12 coal-fired power plants, has among the world’s highest  levels of air pollution, particularly nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur  dioxide. Emissions there exceed the maximum level recommended by the World  Health Organization (Siegfried, 2014).   The role of carbon capture and storage  Some of the environmental challenges associated with a fossil fuel path could be  alleviated by carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which prevent  large amounts of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere. These  technologies capture CO2 produced by large industrial power plants, compress it  for transportation, and then inject it deep into a rock formation at a carefully  selected safe site, where it is permanently stored (Global CCS Institute, n.d.).  Ten countries, including Canada, China, Malawi, and Saudi Arabia, made CCS  part of their climate commitments at the Paris climate conference. CCS is viewed  as a bridge technology that would buy time to make the transition to a  sustainable economy based on energy conservation and renewable energy  sources (Vergragt et al., 2011). It will require significant investment in new  infrastructure such as pipelines and long-term monitoring.  Using CCS as a bridge technology to transition to low-carbon systems could,  however, lock in fossil fuel use, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where much of  the needed generation capacity has yet to be developed. Combining CCS with  bioenergy production, in an approach known as BECCS, could alleviate this risk.  BECCS involves sustainably producing biomass, using it to generate electricity,  and sequestering its emissions—the result is an effective carbon sink.  There are several barriers to deploying CCS in sub-Saharan Africa, including the  high capital cost, the risk of carbon leakage, and the region’s limited geologically  feasible sites and lack of regulatory frameworks. CCS could also threaten food  security in countries where the geologic potential for carbon storage is found on  fertile agricultural land (Román, 2011).  THE RENEWABLE PATH TO INCREASING SUPPLY  The main challenges of using renewables to expand the supply of electricity are  the risk that climate change will hamper hydropower, the intermittency and  variability of solar and wind, and the risk of overgeneration and curtailment.  First, while sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to generate abundant clean,  renewable, and affordable electricity through hydropower, a number of studies  (such as Kammen et al., 2015) reveal a high risk that climate change will reduce  the performance of hydropower dams, as seen recently in the Kariba Dam.  Droughts and unprecedented variability in rainfall will constrain the technical  performance of large hydropower reservoirs, with long-term impacts on  agriculture and electricity production (Kang et al., 2009). Large dams pose social  and ecological risks as well. They can threaten livelihoods by causing the loss of  agricultural land and requiring community resettlement. Dammed reservoirs can  result in stagnant reservoir water, high sedimentation, and algae growth that  39 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  impact wildlife (Union of Concerned Scientists, 2016). For example, the  development of the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River in Ghana led to the  resettlement of about 80,000 people from 740 villages. It also resulted in  biodiversity loss and floods that increased the risk of water-borne diseases  (Kalitsi, 2003). There are measures that can alleviate the detrimental impacts of  large dams, and implementing them requires effective policies and management.  Second, renewable sources of generation, such as wind and solar are variable  and intermittent—that is, they are available only when the wind is blowing and  the sun is shining. Still, they can be forecast to some level of certainty. The real  challenge is that grid systems are conventionally designed to rely on controllable  generators rather than intermittent sources. Many countries in sub-Saharan  Africa may be able to leapfrog this challenge with intentional design.  Finally, electricity consumption in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa peaks in  the evening, whereas solar generation typically peaks in the early to midafternoon.  This mismatch raises a risk of producing more electricity than can be  consumed (overgeneration) at certain times, when electricity generation would  consequently be cut off and not paid for (curtailment).  Cost of renewables  The declining cost of renewables means that high economic cost is no longer the  primary constraint to deploying renewables. The challenge is achieving effective  grid operations. Globally, the weighted average cost of utility-scale installed solar  PV dropped from about $5 per watt in 2009 to about $2 per watt in 2015. Costs in  Africa have been comparable (Figure 15). Prices of solar PV modules have also  dropped significantly since 2009, to about $0.52 to $0.72 per watt in 2015. In  response to this cost reduction, Africa added about 800 MW of solar PV in 2014  and 750 MW in 2015, doubling its cumulative capacity (IRENA, 2016). Despite  sub-Saharan Africa’s high potential for solar generation, most of the continent’s  rapid solar capacity growth has been in North Africa. Recently, a proposed 800  MW solar plant in the United Arab Emirates reported an average cost of $0.03  per kWh (Clifford, 2016), compared with typical per kWh costs of $0.08 for largescale  hydropower, $0.10 for geothermal, and $0.07 to $0.14 for natural gas (IEA,  2014).   Figure 15: Installed cost of existing and proposed utility-scale solar PV in  Africa, 2011–2018  Source: IRENA, 2016.Note: Each circle represents an individual power project.  Overall, attaining a 100% renewable vision in sub-Saharan Africa will require the  following:  1. policies that incentivize renewable energy deployment and discourage  new fossil fuel development,  2. innovative financing mechanisms that allow decentralized solutions to  thrive and be integrated into future grid expansion,  3. an enabling framework that attracts private investors to the energy sector  and builds human capacity by empowering local entrepreneurs,  4. improved organizational procedures and sector management that support  operational power pools powered by international and interregional  transmission lines, allowing power sharing and reduced costs,  5. policies that incentivize and support decentralized renewable energy  systems that enable 100% access to affordable and reliable electricity,  and  6. electricity supply strategies that prioritize diversity of resources such as  dispatchable renewables and storage, negate the need for fossil fuels,  and ensure supply security.  41 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  6. LOW-CARBON GRID  OPERATIONS  The main challenge of a renewable-dominated capacity expansion pathway is  not economic cost—it is the system flexibility required to cope with the  intermittency and variability of solar and wind. High penetration of renewables  requires a power system enabled with ICTs and other smart grid technologies  that allow real-time system monitoring and remote control of voltage and power  flow conditions, which are critical to the rapid response needed for the variability  of wind and solar. It also requires effective grid management that uses power  pools to enable long-reach regional cooperation and power sharing.  SYSTEM FLEXIBILITY  Power system infrastructure and managers must be able to adapt and respond to  changing conditions in various time frames. Short-term grid flexibility involves  balancing demand and supply over minutes and hours of a day, and long-term  grid flexibility involves changing generation and transmission capacity over years  of investment. Increasing the electric power system’s flexibility is critical to  reliable operation under high penetration levels of variable renewable resources.  Sources of flexibility include dispatchable generators, increased transmission  capacity and access, large balancing areas and regional cooperation, demandside  management, and storage.  Every power system possesses an inherent level of flexibility. Electricity cannot  be “paused” as it flows on the wires in the grid, traveling from the generation  source to various end-uses: it is impossible to temporarily store excess electricity  on the wires of the grid in anticipation of a consumer’s decision to flip a light  switch. Instead, the amount of electricity being generated at any time needs to  match the amount of electricity being consumed. Because demand can change  rapidly (e.g., when people turn their lights on after dark), power systems are  designed to be flexible in order to respond to such rapid changes—both  predictable and unpredictable—in demand. Also, robust power systems should  have enough extra generation capacity (also known as “operating” and “spinning”  reserves1) to make up for unexpected generation failure (for example, when a  power plant goes offline).  1  See the lexicon in Text Box 1.   In general, power systems that rely heavily on natural gas and hydropower are  more flexible than systems with large amounts of coal and nuclear. Coal and  nuclear plants take longer to reach their full generation capacity (also known as  their ramping time) than gas plants, and reservoir dams have storage  capabilities. Conventionally, grid operators receive demand forecasts one day  ahead that are updated in the hour ahead and finally in the minutes ahead of  service. It is difficult to plan supply to match demand forecasts using solar and  wind as they vary their output significantly over short time scales, such as hours  (the wind can suddenly stop blowing over a large area, or the sun can go behind  the clouds), and they are not dispatchable. Therefore transitioning to high  penetration levels of variable renewable generation will require more flexibility.  Backup generators can improve flexibility, and this backup capacity need not be  at a one-to-one ratio; because the grid can act as a holistic system, each  installation of renewable generation does not require an equal backup of  dispatchable generation (Cochran et al., 2014). For example, an interconnected  network of grids can supply electricity to cloudy areas drawing on solar  generation in areas where the sun is still shining and using other dispatchable  generation.  This potential of a holistic system argues for building effectively integrated power  pools to link generation capacity over large geographical distances and smooth  out the variable output of solar and wind. Because it takes several years to invest  in and build new generators and transmission lines, planning for system flexibility  is critical to ensure the growth of variable renewable generation. A highly flexible  system ensures that renewables generators will not be curtailed (shut off)  frequently, hence improving the capacity factor of renewable power stations and  increasing the plant’s electricity sales. These features improve the revenue  streams and payback timelines, making renewable generators more attractive to  investors and government stakeholders.  Figuring out how much flexibility is needed in sub-Saharan Africa is critical to  informing policy-makers’ investment decisions, particularly on fuel choices, in the  upcoming years. This calculation requires in-depth power system modeling of  each country’s grid and the power pools (as task that is impossible for some  countries with limited data access). Power system studies will dispel incorrect  notions about the difficulty of operating power systems with high levels of  variable renewable resources and make clear what the actual operating costs of  renewable generation capacity will be. Some countries in the region have  improved access to power system data, and in-depth studies have been carried  out in Kenya and South Africa. High-resolution power system studies in Kenya  have shown that the ratio of storage to wind capacity is about 1:10 for 30%  penetration (Carvallo et al., forthcoming). This ratio is a proxy measure for how  flexible the Kenya grid is to integrating renewables without storage. It also shows  that variable generation like wind does not require one-to-one backup capacity to  ensure a reliable supply (Carvallo et al., forthcoming). Besides adjusting supply  43 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  side resources, power systems can improve flexibility by enabling demand  response and using distributed storage.  In the transition to high renewable power systems, regulators and system  operators can draw from a suite of options (Figure 16). The options include  physical strategies such as battery storage, operational strategies such as  ramping thermal fleets and improved forecasting, and institutional strategies such  as new market designs and integration of demand response. Some sources of  flexibility, such as pumped hydropower storage, are cheaper than adding grid  batteries. Although options and associated costs to increase flexibility are  system-specific, generally tools that help exploit existing flexibility through  changes to system operations and market designs are cheaper than those that  require investments in new sources of flexibility. Although changes to system  operation and market design require less capital investment, they do have  implementation costs and may entail changes to institutional relationships  (Cochran et al., 2014).  Figure 16: Relative costs of strategies for increasing power system  flexibility  Source: Cochran et al., 2014.  The first two columns of Figure 16—system operation and markets—represent  low-cost options but require operational and organizational changes. The load  column represents demand-side changes—particularly demand response. The   remaining columns represent changes to the physical grid (generation plants and  transmission networks).  High system flexibility will prevent the following operational challenges:  • Electricity price volatility. When generators are inflexible and cannot  reduce their output during low load periods, excess energy on the system can  cause prices to drop significantly, exposing plants to high financial risk. Also,  when generators cannot increase their output during high demand periods,  prices skyrocket, to the detriment of distribution companies and end users.  • Energy curtailment. Non-dispatchable or inflexible systems must be  curtailed (shut off) during periods of high generation and low demand on the  system.  • Load shedding/brownouts. Quality of power to end-users depends on the  power system frequency, which is kept at an optimal level by balancing  supply and demand. Inflexible power systems necessitate brownouts and  eventual load shedding in order to return balance to the system during  periods of low generation and high demand.  Matching supply and demand across different load hours and regions (that is,  across time and physical space) is critical to achieving system flexibility, which is  why successful implementation of power pools in sub-Saharan Africa will  facilitate high renewable energy deployment over the coming decades. Power  pools aggregate loads and generators through transmission networks allowing  for greater flexibility in supply and demand.  RENEWABLES AS BASELOAD CAPACITY  Electricity load is typically categorized as baseload, intermediate load, and peak  load (Figure 17). Efforts to achieve high rates of renewable energy penetration  face a challenge in reliably meeting baseload demand. Baseload demand refers  to minimum or predictable demand in a power system that is not highly variable.  Conventionally, baseload demand is met by nuclear and coal because these  plants run at relatively constant output, have slow response times, and have high  investment costs that need to be recovered quickly. Power systems with high  penetrations of renewable energy require generation mixes with high flexibility,  which in turn reduces the need for plants like nuclear, which have low flexibility.  Non-dispatchable renewable generators such solar PV and wind cannot meet  baseload at all times owing to their variability. However, dispatchable renewable  generators such as large hydropower, biogas, and geothermal can supply  flexibility to the power system and meet baseload demand. Therefore, the  capacity of renewables to meet baseload demand will depend on the generation  45 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  mix (of dispatchable and variable energy sources) and demand profile of the  power system.  Figure 17: Load duration curve  Source: Ueckerdt and Kempener, 2015.  Renewable integration will increase as future power systems are enhanced with  smart grid and information and communication technologies (ICTs) that allow  greater remote control of centralized and distributed generation instead of  requiring the system operator to have physical control of the generator. High  system flexibility also helps manage high variability in generation—for example  cloudiness over solar panels—that causes rapid changes in the net load (Figure  18). Rapid changes require fast-ramp plants that can respond quickly by  increasing or decreasing generation in the form of peaker plants and spinning  reserves. The amount of fast-ramp capacity required is dependent, then, on the  power system’s overall generation mix, the hourly load shape, the penetration of  variable renewables, and the accuracy of demand forecasting. Since many parts  of sub-Saharan Africa are not yet grid-connected, building a low-carbon grid with  ICTs and storage technologies would not require large changes to existing  infrastructure. Therefore, the region can develop intentionally by choosing  strategic electricity supply mixes that enable high penetration of renewables. If  the region chooses its future electricity supply mix with flexibility as a priority, it  may reduce the need for centralized energy storage to manage high penetrations  of renewables.   Figure 18: Net load of a grid system in the United States  Source: Cochran et al., 2014.  Demand-side management  Energy efficiency will reduce the overall capacity required and the rate of load  growth, enabling more sustainable and less expensive funding situations.  Demand-side management strategies such as demand response can facilitate  the use of renewables to serve a larger proportion of daily load and reduce the  need for large-scale storage by reducing peak, and shifting demand to match the  timing of variable generation. Demand response allows the shifting of loads by  getting end-users to shut off appliances and larger industrial machines at peak  times and to run those machines at specific off-peak hours instead, changing the  load profile to match the generation supply. This is especially important for  renewables as net load can change rapidly. It also allows demand to be met  flexibly and quickly and avoids the curtailment of solar and wind generation.  Role of storage  The need for storage depends on how many flexible resources can be  incorporated into the power system and on the shape of the demand profile.  Inexpensive batteries will facilitate electrification through micro-grids until the  centralized grid is extended to rural areas. Operational challenges due to the  variability of wind and solar can be alleviated by forecasting solar insolation and  wind speeds in order to plan electricity dispatch. In parallel, storage technologies  that offset the variations in solar electricity output need to be developed.  Batteries are not the only option, however. Sub-Saharan Africa could develop a  47 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  diverse generation portfolio and use spinning reserves to manage intermittent  generation from minutes to a few hours. Modern natural gas plants are designed  to ramp up rapidly at about 50 MW per minute. These, combined with smart grid  technologies such as improved sensing and control, will be sufficient to  accommodate most of the intermittency problems of renewable energy without  the need for additional storage. At very high penetrations of solar and wind,  distributed energy storage sites may be needed. The most inexpensive ways to  store electricity for the medium and long term are pumped hydroelectric and  compressed air. These are greatly restricted, however, by geographical  availability (Kenning, 2015). Apart from pumped hydropower storage using large  reservoirs, the most prevalent type of storage in sub-Saharan Africa currently  consists of batteries, mainly on the distributed scale for micro-grids. For example,  in Marsabit, Kenya, flywheels are used to manage the variability of a micro-grid  powered by wind and diesel (Kenning, 2015). Flywheel storage works by storing  electricity in the form of rotational kinetic energy in a fast-rotating wheel. It spins  faster to store energy and reduces its speed to discharge energy.  Overall, sub-Saharan Africa will require a mix of fast-ramp generation plants and  energy storage technologies to support high penetrations of renewables with the  least cost and environmental impact. Figure 19 shows the levelized cost of  various energy storage technologies at different scales of implementation  (Lazard, 2013), illustrating that a single technology can vary in levelized cost  depending on what services it provides to the electric grid.   Figure 19: Unsubsidized levelized cost of energy storage across various  technologies and grid service  Source: Lazard, 2013.  The future of nuclear power in sub-Saharan Africa  Nuclear energy, a low-carbon resource, could play a significant role in electrifying  sub-Saharan Africa, and there is interest across the region in ramping up this  form of generation. South Africa, the sole country in sub-Saharan Africa with  active nuclear power plants, is seeking to expand its capacity. However, nuclear  power has significant economic, environmental, and public safety risks. It has low  operating costs and high fuel density but is burdened by high upfront capital  costs. Nuclear plants are prone to long construction and licensing delays.  Nuclear power raises safety concerns, including the issue of how to dispose of  spent fuel and the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation accompanying the uptake  of nuclear power technology and fuel enrichment processes. Its overall cost is  about five times higher than the cost of natural gas generation. And the  estimated cost of decommissioning each plant, including used fuel and site  restoration costs is about $500 million (Chu & Majumdar, 2012). Small modular  nuclear reactors could alleviate the challenge of cost and construction overruns,  but the expertise and workforce required to safely adopt and operate nuclear  plants are still lacking in the region (Castellano et al., 2015). As the cost of solar  and wind decline and smart grid technologies including storage move forward, a  nuclear pathway will expose the region to comparatively greater financial risk and  energy insecurity (Chu & Majumdar, 2012).  49 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  POWER POOLS AS A FACILITATOR  Regional cooperation—fostered by power pools and cross-border transmission  networks—will be critical to closing the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa.  Such cooperation can offer economies of scale to small countries with limited  load. It can reduce the average cost of generation by pooling countries’  resources. It can help diversify countries’ energy portfolios and shield them from  price variability stemming from dependence on a single fuel or from hydropower  seasonality. And it can reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports by enabling  large concentrated renewable resources to be shared. For example, the benefits  of geothermal resources in Kenya can be shared with South Africa, which is  currently powered by coal, and hydropower in Central Africa can be shared with  Senegal (Castellano et al., 2015), which is currently powered by diesel.  But regional cooperation poses its own political and economic challenges. To  develop and operate power pools, member countries will need to find ways to  effectively collaborate. They will need mutual trust in the power capacities of  each country’s grid system. They must train local personnel and develop power  systems expertise. Finally, they must create effective international frameworks to  govern both the legal and technical aspects of the interconnections.  There are four power pools in sub-Saharan Africa:  • The Central Africa Power Pool, created in 2003, consists of Angola,  Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic  Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Sao Tome.  The CAPP is still in the development stage and is not yet operational.  • The Eastern Africa Power Pool (EAPP) was established in 2005 by seven  countries: Burundi, DRC, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Sudan. It has  been adopted as a specialized institution to foster power system  interconnectivity by the heads of state of the Common Market for Eastern and  Southern Africa (COMESA). Since then, Libya, Tanzania, and Uganda have  joined the EAPP. The EAPP has released master plans and regional power  system studies and is projected to be fully operational within several years.  • The Southern Africa Power Pool was created in 1995 by 12 countries:  Angola, Botswana, DRC, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South  Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It is the most advanced  and active power pool in the region, with international energy trades and  operational short-term energy markets.  • The West African Power Pool (WAPP) is a specialized institution of the  Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and consists of 14  countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,  Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and  Togo. The WAPP is still under development and is not yet operational.   In 2012, the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa was initiated by  the Africa Development Bank Group with a mandate to enhance cross-border  energy market development, among other priorities. The program includes four  electricity transmission corridors (not yet operational), three of which will be  based in sub-Saharan Africa:  • a north-south transmission line from Egypt to South Africa with branches in  East Africa,  • a transmission line from Angola to South Africa with branches in Central and  West Africa, and  • a West African transmission line linking Senegal and Ghana with several  branches in other countries.  51 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  7. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY  RESOURCES  Expanding centralized generation capacity is not the only way to electrify sub-  Saharan Africa. Off-grid and distributed energy systems now offer new  opportunities to close the electricity gap. Historically, these off-grid systems were  fueled by diesel, which presents a transport risk in remote areas. Now, owing to  the modular nature of renewable energy such as solar and small-scale  hydropower, most off-grid systems are powered renewably. Improved knowledge  and management of electric distribution systems will facilitate distributed energy  resources (DERs) such as rooftop and communal solar PV and battery systems.  THE POTENTIAL OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY  RESOURCES  DERs have many advantages over centralized grid systems, such as reduced  power loss, scaled design, and suitability to renewable sources. In particular,  DERs have the potential to alleviate the social inequalities reinforced by  centralized grids. Existing grids in sub-Saharan Africa favor wealthier  communities, which lie in areas where the limited grid exists and which can afford  the relatively expensive connection fees, while rural communities are left with  limited options for electricity access. This intraregional electricity gap perpetuates  inequality by hindering the welfare development of those who are currently poor.  DERs in the form of micro-grids have the potential to bypass this challenge and  rapidly deliver power to communities without grid access.  Unlike transmission systems, distribution systems have in the past had little  operator monitoring. With the advent of smart grid technologies, sub-Saharan  Africa has the opportunity to make its grids receptive to DERs, taking pressure  off of centralized generation and increasing overall grid reliability. ICTs will be  critical to the success of DERs because they allow remote communication for  maintenance and repair, easy data analytics, and smart metering. DERs are  waiting on the right mix of catalysts, such as cheaper battery costs and smarter  ICTs, to drive unprecedented growth and deployment.  So far, the discourse on electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa has been  dominated by arguments that pit centralized solutions such as grid extension  against decentralized solutions such as mini-grids. Some argue that mini-grids  are incapable of supplying reliable and modern levels of energy services, while  others argue that grid extension is too slow and expensive to reach the millions   of people without electricity. These all-or-nothing arguments are based on the  outdated assumption that electricity provision must come from large-scale  centralized generation and grid networks commissioned by national  governments. In reality, to outpace the region’s growing rate of electricity poverty,  both solutions must be deployed in tandem and synergistically (Casillas &  Kammen, 2010). Micro-grids must be designed as a stopgap for main grid  extension for several years, and they must be seamlessly integrated with the  main grid when it arrives. Lack of integration may result in stranded energy  assets, which will deter investors from investing in small private energy firms that  may have the capacity to reach the remotest regions. Private micro-grid  companies need to be supported by national electric utilities and rural  electrification programs. Also, countries should build human capacity and enable  job creation by giving workers access to skills training on installing and  maintaining micro-grids. Finally, countries could also provide tax and import  incentives to micro-grid developers.  COMPARISON OF DECENTRALIZED ENERGY  TECHNOLOGIES  Strategies for deploying renewable electricity in off-grid areas include the use of  solar lanterns, solar home systems, and solar micro-grids. To cope with  intermittency, solar and wind micro-grids are often built as hybrid systems with  natural gas, biogas, or diesel. As the cost of energy storage declines, renewable  micro-grids can become the sole source of electricity in both grid and off-grid  areas (for an in-depth comparison of these technologies, see Part 2 of this  report).  Solar lanterns  Solar lanterns combine small photovoltaic panels with lighting fixtures. They are  sold as a single unit or as a PV panel with a set of lights that can be charged  during the day when the PV panel is generating electricity. In some parts of sub-  Saharan Africa, standalone solar lanterns are readily accessible and can be  found in supermarkets, hardware stores, gas station convenience stores, and  other small vendors. Because of the declining cost of solar PV technology, solar  lanterns can provide higher output and higher-quality lighting at the same or  lower cost as kerosene lamps and candles, which would otherwise provide  lighting. Because the fuel cost is zero, they also reduce the variable costs  associated with kerosene and other common lighting energy sources.  Solar lighting trade associations, like the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association  (GOGLA), and other organizations develop and enforce high quality standards to  advocate for policies that foster a better business environment for solar  53 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  companies. Despite these efforts, there are many inexpensive, poorly made solar  lanterns that draw in consumers but reach the end of their product lifetimes over  short periods of time, with few options for repair or maintenance.  Pico-solar and solar home systems  Pico-solar, or pico-PV, systems are very small solar PV systems that mainly  supply power for lighting and other relatively low-load applications like phone  charging. Capacities for pico-solar systems, as defined here, range from 1W to  10W. The cost of these systems, as well as larger-capacity solar home systems  (SHSs), has dropped over the past decade thanks to major decreases in  manufacturing and materials costs for PV panels. Solar technologies at various  capacity levels have also become more cost-effective options for off-grid  households owing to improvements in energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs,  particularly light-emitting diode (LED) technology. They have also benefited from  innovations in pricing and payment systems based on mobile phone banking  transactions and other ICT advances.  In East Africa, companies like M-Kopa Solar are deploying pico-solar systems as  a kit with several lighting and entertainment appliances. Consumers can  purchase these either by paying the full cost upfront or by paying in installments  over time using mobile money mechanisms such as M-PESA and Airtel MTN.  This pay-as-you-go (PAYG) business model has boosted electricity access for  communities without grid connections and without sufficient income to pay the  capital costs of a home-scale solar system upfront. M-Kopa systems consist of  8W solar panels that come with several LED lights, a rechargeable radio, and a  cell-phone charger. As of 2016, M-Kopa had connected more than 300,000  homes to solar power (PwC, 2016).  Companies marketing SHSs in emerging markets have, likewise, had success  using the PAYG model combined with mobile phone payment systems, whether  or not the systems are sold in tandem with appliances. Mobisol, a major supplier  of solar home systems in Rwanda and Tanzania, bundles different ranges of  solar PV panels (80W, 100W, 120W, and 200W arrays) with kits of direct-current  (DC) appliances (see Figure 20). Its most basic package is an 80W system with  seven LED lights, a mobile phone–charging station, and balance-of-system  components, such as wiring and switches. This system can support lighting  fixtures, charge multiple mobile phones, power a small radio, and run a television  for several hours. Mobisol’s largest system provides enough power to charge  laptops, run a DC refrigerator, and power a television for longer periods. Mobisol  has to date installed more than 3 MW of solar home system capacity in East  Africa—a testament to the PAYG business model and the appropriate product  scale for low-income and rising middle-class customers without central grid  access.   Figure 20: A sample 100W solar home system with kit of DC appliances  from Mobisol  Source: Mobisol, 2017.  Micro-grids  A micro-grid is a small-scale power generation and distribution system that  delivers electricity to multiple buildings in a village. Existing micro-grid projects in  sub-Saharan Africa are typically privately owned and operated, with the initial  capital for infrastructure investments coming from varied sources, including  donors, private debt and equity investors, and government grants or loans.  Micro-grids can also be owned and operated by a public utility or by a hybrid of  private and public models.  Micro-grids can provide electricity to even remote sites because innovations in  ICTs enable demand forecasting and pay-as-you-go services. Also, microgrids  do not require large investments and long construction times—although the  capital costs are still prohibitive for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.  Diesel fuel prices are variable, and diesel delivery to remote areas can add  significantly to the transaction costs of electricity from a diesel generator.  However, diesel is easily stored, and its generator technology is mature and  standardized.  Renewable sources are now more affordable for use in micro-grids thanks to  rapid renewable project construction timelines, falling prices of solar and wind  technologies, and improving battery storage technologies. In addition, modern  ICT systems allow for less-costly remote operation, billing and customer  services, and mobile phone payment systems for customers in rural off-grid  communities. However, tariffs for electricity from renewable micro-grids are  usually higher than grid tariffs in urban areas because the micro-grids lack  economies of scale and do not benefit from the government subsidies on grid  tariffs.  55 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Since renewable generation has no fuel cost, the decision to develop a diesel-based  or a solar PV micro-grid lies in the lifetime cost comparison between the  capital and fuel costs of the respective options. As capital costs for renewables  decrease, especially in solar, renewable-based micro-grids are becoming more  popular. Today, companies like PowerHive and PowerGen in Kenya are  developing micro-grids that rely on solar PV generation, along with a few wind  generation pilots, combined with battery storage, or hybrid renewable-diesel  micro-grid systems (Figure 21). A hybrid diesel micro-grid with storage  incorporated can supply electricity to consumers when wind speeds are too low  to make power or after the sun sets each day.  Figure 21: PowerGen project in Samburu County, Kenya showing a 3kW  micro-grid  Source: PowerGen, 2017.  The main challenge facing micro-grids today is high regulatory uncertainty about  the role and eventual fate of the physical assets if and when the central grid is  built out and able to offer cheaper tariffs. Designing micro-grids to eventually  connect to the central grid may reduce the uncertainty around micro-grid  investments and change the nature of the energy services provided by the microgrid.  For example, a grid-connected micro-grid may evolve from an on-site  generator into a power purchaser from the central grid, functioning as a small  distributor of power to its existing household connections. To alleviate market  uncertainty in the financing of micro-grid projects, a general regulatory framework  for micro-grids could be put in place to clearly define how micro-grids can be  licensed and managed. Policy changes of this nature may already be in motion in  countries like Kenya.   The cost of electricity shapes the services people use and their demand for  electricity. If electricity is expensive, households will use it only to access  services that are highly valued, that require small amounts of energy, and that  can only be provided by electricity (such as charging cell phones) or for which  electricity does a better job of providing the service (such electric light versus  candles). Likewise, households will refrain from using electricity for tasks that use  large amounts of energy and for which substitute sources of energy might be  available, such as cooking, which can be done using solid fuels. As prices fall,  the number of services a household can access increases. As a result, the  services any household is willing to access is related to the generation  technology that determines the price of electricity. Figure 22 shows the  relationship between the price per unit of energy to consumers and the energy  services demanded for power from the centralized grid, a micro-grid, a solar  home system, a solar lamp, a kerosene lamp, and batteries. In many parts of  sub-Saharan Africa, the supply of electricity through the centralized grid can be  unpredictable, with power shortages occurring in peak demand periods.  Depending on the quality and consistency of service from the centralized grid,  some customers may prefer to pay a premium for power produced by a reliable  micro-grid rather than for unpredictable power from the centralized grid.  Figure 22: Per-unit energy price versus level-of-service chart for various  energy technologies  Source: Schnitzer et al., 2014.  Achieving high penetration of renewables in sub-Saharan Africa presents  challenges related to achieving system flexibility and gaining access to financing,  57 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  but it also creates opportunities stemming from, for example, operational power  pools and smart grid technologies that can lead to affordable clean electricity,  reduced emissions, and less pollution. Policy-makers must consider all of these  factors holistically to enable the development of a low-carbon grid.   8. CASE STUDIES OF  CENTRALIZED CAPACITY  EXPANSION  Vetting possible pathways to closing the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa will  require modeling of the region’s power systems. Existing analyses at the pan-  African level estimate that capacity will grow annually at around 8–13%,  expanding by 50–200 GW by 2025 (Bazilian et al., 2012; Sanoh et al., 2014;  Sparrow et al., 2002). Yet modeling future power systems in sub-Saharan Africa  will need to be context specific, varying from country to country, and there is little  research in the literature on national-level sustainable power system expansion  for individual countries. Power systems modeling of many countries in the region  is challenging because of the lack of reliable and accurate data. Some countries,  like Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa (IRENA, 2015), have made considerable  effort to record their power systems data, but even in these cases some data are  not available in the public domain and access remains a challenge for  researchers and analysts. Instead of a pan-continental model of all of sub-  Saharan Africa based on unrealistic data, we attempt to illustrate the trade-offs of  various capacity expansion pathways to closing the electricity gap through case  studies of Kenya and Nigeria, where we have obtained reliable power systems  data. The capacity expansion model2 determines the least-cost pathway to  expanding electricity generation over a time horizon (usually 20 years into the  future) and compares the associated economic, environmental, and social  impacts of these pathways.  Text Box 4: Modeling energy systems  This analysis focuses on quantifying the grid-based electricity supply needed to meet  demand growth. The capacity expansion model determines the financially optimal  generation portfolio for Kenya and Nigeria based on inputs such as the energy resource  potential of the region, the existing installed capacity, average capacity factors, and peak  contribution of each generation technology.  COUNTRY PROFILES  Kenya is chosen because it is one of the region’s fastest-growing economies,  with abundant renewable energy sources, yet only about 40% of its population  2  See the model description in the Appendix.  59 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  has reliable electricity access. Nigeria is selected because it has the largest  economy in Africa, with crippling electricity shortages in the midst of abundant  renewable and fossil resources. Only about 50% of its population has reliable  electricity access.  Kenya  Electricity in Kenya is distributed by the Kenya Power and Lighting Company  (KLPC), which serves just over 2 million customers with a peak grid-based  demand of around 1,250 MW. The installed generation capacity is about 2 GW:  44% hydroelectric, 36% fossil fuels (diesel and gas), 22% geothermal, and 0.3%  wind power (Ackermann et al., 2014). Kenya is well positioned to integrate large  amounts of renewables owing to its abundance of geothermal, wind, and  hydropower, which are relatively cheap. It has rapidly added generation capacity  over the past decade and made impressive progress in providing access to clean  and affordable electricity. However, Kenya also had plans to add 4,500 MW of  coal by 2030.  Nigeria  Nigeria is Africa’s largest oil producer and in 2012 was the world’s fourth largest  exporter of liquefied natural gas. Nigeria’s installed capacity is about 13 GW—  based on 70% natural gas and about 30% hydropower—and it has a peak gridbased  demand of about 4,500 MW. Only about 3 GW of its installed capacity is  operational, however, owing to gas unavailability, water shortages, and  infrastructure breakdown. Altogether, about 2.7 GW of generation capacity is lost  owing to gas constraints in a country with one of the largest natural gas deposits  in the world, up to 0.5 GW is lost to poor water management (Ley et al., 2015).  Nigeria is not on track to meet many of its generation capacity expansion targets  published in 2006 (Gujba et al., 2010). Because of these challenges, Nigeria  decided to privatize the electricity sector in 2013. The benefits of this move will  take time to become apparent as the sector restructures. Nigeria is well  positioned to integrate large amounts of renewables thanks to its abundance of  hydropower and natural gas resources, which can provide the necessary  operational flexibility.  METHODOLOGY  The optimization model requires a set of common input variables: a portfolio of  existing and potential resources; projections for variable (fuel) and capital costs;  annual load forecasts; and characterization of the operational features of the  different energy technologies such as resource potential, average capacity factor,  and peak contribution. The portfolio of future resources considered are   hydropower, geothermal, natural gas and coal, wind, solar photovoltaic, and  diesel. The model considers all existing plants in the Kenyan and Nigerian power  systems as of 2015. It outputs the annual investment required for the least-cost  generation portfolio constrained to meet annual load and peak demand.  The model accounts for non-dispatchable renewables and net load variability by  using a peak contribution factor. For example, solar capacity additions in the  model contribute 0% capacity to peak demand because Kenya and Nigeria have  an evening peak demand, when solar is not available (Figure 9). The model also  includes a 15% capacity reserve margin to account for reliability. It does not have  high geospatial and temporal (hourly) resolution, a trade-off that permits  reasonable estimates without large data requirements that would be prohibitive  given the state of data availability in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa. This  approach also allows for clear sensitivity analysis by duplicating the model over  varying scenarios and illustrating the trade-offs in terms of costs, fuel choices,  and policy targets. The model’s generation capacity estimates are conservative  because it includes the peak contribution factor that accounts for the availability  of renewables, and its cost estimates are also conservative because it excludes  the cost of upgrading existing infrastructure. Therefore, the results should be  interpreted as the least estimate of expansion capacity and cost required to  alleviate the electricity poverty in the region.  Generation plants are lumped into resource categories: solar PV, wind, biomass,  small hydro, large hydro, coal, geothermal, natural gas, and diesel. Natural gas is  split into combined cycle and combustion turbine to include variations in how the  plants run as baseload or peak capacity. The cost of each resource is split into  annualized capital cost ($/kW-yr) and variable cost ($/kWh).  The most recent World Bank commodity price forecasts are used for coal, oil (for  diesel and fuel oil), and liquefied natural gas (LNG) (Baffes, 2016). On average,  the coal price is $50 a ton, oil is $50 a barrel, and natural gas is $9–12 per  MMBtu. Solar PV cost forecasts are taken from a 2015 study developed by the  German Fraunhofer Institute (Mayer et al., 2015). Wind, combined cycle, gas  turbine, combustion turbine, and coal unit costs come from a 2013 report by the  U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA, 2013). For wind, we assume a  linear trend in capital cost reduction of 2% a year, in line with empirical results  (Wiser & Bolinger, 2016). Geothermal unit costs are taken from Kenya’s leastcost  power development plans.  SCENARIOS  The initial least-cost scenario does not have any additional constraints and is  referred to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Other environmental and other  policy scenarios are explored using additional model constraints. Scenarios are  61 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  chosen based on pertinent realities in each county. Kenya has plans to build  about 4,500 MW of coal to keep up with its demand growth. Nigeria’s generation  mix is currently dominated by natural gas and hydropower. Both countries are  adopting energy efficiency measures as outlined in their power plans. The impact  of a carbon tax is explored as well, in line with current global discussions on  accounting for the environmental externalities of fossil fuel use.  The optimal generation expansion pathways through 2035 for Kenya and Nigeria  are based on the following scenarios:  Kenya  1. BAU: This scenario finds the least-cost expansion pathway using a 10%  annual demand growth rate.  2. Low load: This scenario is based on reduced load and peak demand  forecasts, assuming energy efficiency strategies.  3. Coal: This scenario constrains the model to install 1,920 MW of coal by  2020 and 4,500 MW of coal by 2030, according to Kenya’s medium-term  plans.  4. Carbon tax: This scenario adds a $40/ton CO2 tax starting in 2016,  based on the social cost of carbon.  5. Carbon tax + 2030 coal: This scenario constrains the model by adding a  $40/ton CO2 tax starting in 2016 and installing 4,500 MW of coal in 2030.  Nigeria  1. BAU: This scenario finds the least-cost expansion pathway using a 6%  annual demand growth rate.  2. Low load: This scenario is based on reduced load and peak demand  forecasts, assuming energy efficiency measures.  3. Gas and hydropower: This scenario restricts resource potential to  natural gas and hydropower only to reflect Nigeria’s current fuel choices.  4. Carbon tax: This scenario constrains the model by adding a $40/ton CO2  tax starting in 2016, based on the social cost of carbon.  Figures 23–26 display the results in terms of the incremental generation capacity  needed in five-year increments—that is, how much additional capacity will be  needed in each five-year period to meet the conditions of each scenario by 2035.  Tables 2–5 show the total cost and levelized cost of each scenario’s generation  portfolio.   Business-as-usual scenario  The model results show that Kenya’s load growth can be met sustainably and  cost-effectively predominantly with geothermal and wind resources, together with  some natural gas (Figure 23). Coal is not an economically optimal choice. Most  of Kenya’s generation capacity additions occur later in the time horizon, between  2030 and 2035.  Figure 23: Incremental capacity expansion under the BAU scenario in  Kenya  Nigeria will need more generation capacity than its current plans to meet its  existing demand and forecasted demand growth. Nigeria has so much unmet  demand today compared with its existing capacity that more than 10 GW of  additional capacity is required every five years. The least-cost expansion  pathway for Nigeria includes hydropower, natural gas, and solar PV (Figure 24).  Coal is not economically optimal in this case either. Generation expansion plans  must be coupled with extensive transmission and distribution system upgrades  (those costs are not included here).  63 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 24: Incremental capacity expansion under the BAU scenario in  Nigeria  Coal scenario in Kenya  Generation technology choices will be locked in for at least 30 years because  generation assets are long-lived and time is required to recover investments in  them. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate the significant economic and  environmental and social trade-offs involved in transitioning to a low-carbon grid.  To determine the trade-offs of coal development in Kenya, the model was  constrained to include Kenya’s plans of 4,500 MW of coal in 2030. Coal is not  identified as the least-cost electricity source in any of the scenarios examined for  Kenya and Nigeria. Under our assumptions, the model shows that Kenya’s plan  to add 4,500 MW of coal by 2030 increases generation costs by about $2 billion  in 2035 compared with the BAU pathway. The model shows that coal displaces  geothermal generation, which is a clean and cheap baseload generation source  (Figure 25).  Coal development will result in significant environmental and public health risks  for local communities in Kenya’s Kitui and Lamu Counties, where the local coal is  found, and also in coastal areas for imported coal. It locks Kenya into a  technology many countries are eschewing. Operationally, coal provides baseload  capacity and cannot rapidly respond to system variations as natural gas does. If  it chooses to develop coal plants, Kenya may still need to add flexibility to its  system in the form of gas turbines, diesel engines, or energy storage.   Figure 25: Incremental capacity expansion under the coal scenario in  Kenya  Gas and hydropower scenario in Nigeria  If Nigeria restricts generation options to hydropower and natural gas, as it  currently has, its generation costs over 2016–2035 will be $6.5 billion more than  a diversified BAU pathway that includes solar PV. Developing Nigeria’s  renewable resources and reducing its dependence on natural gas and  hydropower is the economically sound expansion pathway and has the added  benefit of preserving the environment. The magnitude of incremental capacity  required from 2025 to 2035 appears less when only natural gas is chosen  because gas has a higher capacity value than solar, so fewer megawatts of gas  are needed to meet the same amount of load (Figure 26). This does not mean,  however, that it is a cheaper expansion pathway (Table 2).  65 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  Figure 26: Incremental capacity expansion under the natural gas and  hydropower scenario in Nigeria  Low load scenario  In the low-load scenario, energy efficiency strategies for achieving lower-than-expected  demand growth in Kenya would lead to reductions in total cumulative  capacity of about 5 GW and savings of about $5 billion (about 25%) in total  generation costs compared with the BAU scenario (Table 1). Similarly, a low-load  scenario featuring energy-efficient growth in Nigeria could save 7 GW of new  capacity installment and $10 billion (about 11%) in system generation costs (  Table 2). In these scenarios, the same types of generation resources are chosen,  but less of each resource is deployed, resulting in lower costs.  Carbon tax scenario  Because of the availability and affordability of geothermal and wind resources in  Kenya, and solar and hydropower in Nigeria, the BAU scenarios result in clean-energy  portfolios without the need to internalize emissions damage through cost  instruments such as carbon taxes. By 2035 the share of annual generation  coming from renewable sources, excluding large hydropower, would be 90% in  Kenya (due to its abundant geothermal resources) and about 30% in Nigeria.  As a result, the carbon tax scenario, which applies a carbon tax of $40/ton of  CO2, has no significant impact on the types of resources used to fill the electricity  gap. In Kenya the carbon tax increases costs by $0.5 billion, about 2% of the   least-cost pathway, because the BAU mix there is already dominated by lowcarbon  technologies. In Nigeria it increases costs by about $10 billion, about 10%  of the least-cost pathway, because Nigeria relies more heavily on natural gas.  If Kenya proceeds with future coal plans, however, a carbon tax will have  significant impacts. Including a carbon tax in the 4,500 MW plan for coal  increases cost by more than $6 billion compared with the BAU scenario.  SUMMARY OF RESULTS    PATHWAY TRADE-OFFS  Given the abundance of renewable resources on the continent, countries have  significant potential to use variable renewable energy to provide baseload  capacity by integrating geographically diversified sources and employing existing  grid flexibility as described. This ability depends partly on the existing fuel mix of  the grid, but because power systems in sub-Saharan Africa are relatively young,  expansion could be carried out strategically to accommodate large penetrations  of variable renewable resources. For example, countries with large hydropower  and natural gas capacities in existing grids can cost-effectively transition to large-scale  integration of renewable resources (as seen in the Kenya and Nigeria case  studies), and even more so by enabling regional energy trading.  Fossil fuels will play a role in the region’s transition because of its existing  installed capacity and the ability of resources such as natural gas and diesel to  provide system flexibility. As energy storage costs decline, the need for gas and  diesel may be displaced. Although renewable generation now has costs similar to  that of fossil fuels and avoids the associated environmental risks, a 100%  renewable grid will require large-scale storage owing to load fluctuations,  unexpected weather changes, unexpected plant and grid outages, and solar and  wind variability.  The economic, environmental, and political trade-offs and impacts of sub-  Saharan Africa’s fuel choices, as seen through the case studies are the following:  1. Coal development will subject communities to significant environmental  degradation and public health risks. This risk exposure is unnecessary  because cheap renewable alternatives are available, as shown in Kenya  and Nigeria. In countries without cheaper and cleaner alternatives to coal,  regional cooperation through power pools offers a viable way of meeting  electricity demand sustainably. The Kenya and Nigeria case studies show  that governments should consider coal development plans carefully and  cautiously. They also underline the need for accessible data on the power  systems of other countries in the region, because the potential  environmental costs of choosing coal today are large.  2. Building coal power plants today as a stopgap on the way to transitioning  to renewable energy may cause path dependency and lock countries into  a suboptimal expansion pathway that is economically and  environmentally expensive.  3. Power systems built for coal are different from power systems built for  renewables, and deploying coal today may thus determine system  characteristics, such as operational flexibility, that may limit future  integration of renewables.  69 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  4. There are economic trade-offs between low-capital-cost/high-variable-cost  resources (typically coal, natural gas, and diesel) and high-capital-cost/  low-variable-cost resources (typically renewables such as solar and  wind). These trade-offs are important to consider for capital-scarce sub-  Saharan countries and may also have implications for countries’ trade  balance and exposure to financial risks.  SUMMARY  This chapter demonstrates the economic, environmental, and operational tradeoffs  involved in filling the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa, but these tradeoffs  are context specific and require power system modeling, which is prohibitive  for many countries in the region owing to the lack of data. The case studies of  Kenya and Nigeria show that renewables are cost competitive and that fuels  such as natural gas can play a role in providing system flexibility until grid  storage costs decline. The case studies also show that the scale of centralized  generation expansion required to meet moderate load growth by 2035 is  significant compared with many countries’ historical investments in power  systems and rate of system expansion. The region has underinvested for a  number of years: current investment in sub-Saharan electricity systems is about  US$8 billion a year. This is inadequate to overcome the existing shortfall in  infrastructure, to expand access and coverage, and to meet growth in demand  (Cartwright, 2015). Grid-based power generation capacity in all of sub-Saharan  Africa increased by 22 GW from 2000 to 2012, from about 68 GW to 90 GW, with  South Africa alone accounting for about half of the total (IEA, 2014). The model  shows that Nigeria alone will have to install at least an additional 36 GW by 2035  to keep up with grid-based load growth alone.  To achieve full electricity access, sub-Saharan Africa must rely on a combination  of many pathways and strategies, such as synergies between centralized and  distributed energy systems, bolstered financial support and investment, and  improved institutional capacity and management. Providing affordable and  reliable electricity for all in sub-Saharan Africa will require unprecedented  financial, social, and political efforts.   9. CONCLUSION  This report has provided an account of the state of the power sector in sub-  Saharan Africa, and the challenges and opportunities of various power expansion  pathways. We have shown that the renewable energy potential in the region is  abundant, and the costs are declining and reaching parity with conventional  generation resources. We have also shown that the investment and planned use  of fossil fuels should be judicious given that decades of its development in the  region have done little to increase energy access. It is critical that fuel choices be  considered cautiously, particularly coal, which proved to be a costly pathway to  electrification in Kenya and Nigeria. The successful transition to high  penetrations of renewables will depend on various sources of system flexibility,  particularly natural gas and grid storage, and on the effective operation of  regional power pools. Also, we emphasize that distributed and centralized energy  systems will have to be strategically deployed to operate in synergy and  complement each other over their operational lifetimes.  Lack of data access and availability in sub-Saharan Africa hinders robust power  system analysis from informing many countries’ policy decisions. This situation  risks locking the region into a development path that is economically and  environmentally suboptimal for its people. Attaining 100% electricity access  rapidly across the region will require a mix of pathways and scales.  The narrative around the electricity gap in sub-Saharan Africa has been  dominated by disconnected questions. Where should supply come from—fossil  fuels or renewables? What scale of infrastructure should be deployed to reach  unconnected populations—centralized grid extensions or distributed systems? In  contrast, we redefine the electricity gap as an integral problem that involves  supply-demand mismatches, inequality, and electricity access decisions—it is  ultimately a social and technical challenge. In our view, the conventional  approach relying on fossil fuels and grid extensions is being superseded by a  new paradigm based on renewable resources and scale-appropriate  technologies. These elements will be at the core of public and private decisions  to empower sub-Saharan Africa in the coming decades.  71 Generating energy for sustainable and equitable development  "

Currently 633 million  people are estimated to lack access to electricity, and 792 million people are  forced to cook with traditional biomass on unimproved cookstoves. While efforts  at electrification are expected to bring down the number of people who do not  have access to electricity, the number of people using unimproved cooking  facilities is expected to increase through 2030.  Energy-poor households suffer from a wide range of impacts, from increased risk  of premature death due to indoor pollution to forgone productivity gains and lower  quality of life. On top of these impacts, energy-poor households must spend a  greater proportion of their income to meet their basic energy needs. They also  spend more time engaging in energy-intensive tasks than do wealthier  households who have access to modern energy sources.  Past efforts to address energy poverty have focused on promoting energy  access. Historically these efforts have centered on providing people with  electricity, resulting in a binary measure of energy poverty in which people are  either “connected” or “not connected.” More recent research has shed light on  the complex ways in which households use energy, showing that it is determined  by a variety of factors, including the affordability, reliability, and quality of the  energy sources available. The result has been an evolution toward a tiered  measure of energy access. Overall energy access is hypothesized to offer  significant benefits, providing access to services (such as street lighting and  schools), improving welfare, driving better health and environmental outcomes,  and promoting economic development.  This report forms the second of a two-part series. It is an effort to explore the  technological opportunities for addressing energy poverty, as well as the  policy challenges involved in promoting and deploying these technologies.  The first report deals with questions regarding the role of fossil fuels in closing  the energy gap in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall this series finds that addressing  energy poverty will require a mix of technologies. Within these, there are a  number of important areas that policy advocates can focus on as levers to  promote effective efforts to address energy poverty.  In the policy environment surrounding energy access, a major focus has fallen on  providing access to electricity, and recent changes in the price of renewable  energy technologies have sparked debate about the best way to do so. Different  approaches include the following technologies:  1. Large-scale grids. Expanding the electrical grid is the most established  approach to providing access to electricity. Electricity supplied by the grid is  7 Addressing energy poverty  available at the lowest tariffs because the grid offers opportunities to exploit  economies of scale. A large-scale grid can also integrate large amounts of  renewable energy. Expanding the grid, however, involves high up-front costs,  and the ability to take advantage of economies of scale is limited in sub-  Saharan Africa, where populations are dispersed and have limited ability to  pay for electricity. Finally, the grid’s physical characteristics mean that it  operates as an almost perfect monopoly and as such is best managed as a  regulated utility. In sub-Saharan Africa, where regulation is often weak,  utilities have performed notoriously poorly.  2. Mini-grids. Although mini-grids involve lower up-front costs than expanding  the grid on a large scale, they are still capable of supplying electricity in  quantities that can match the services supplied by the grid. However, the  current high cost of renewable components and battery storage means that  electricity from mini-grids tends to be more expensive than that provided by  the grid. Notably, future reductions in the cost of renewable components and  storage are not expected to fully close this gap. This challenge is particularly  significant given the low incomes of energy-poor households. In addition,  although the up-front costs of mini-grids are lower than grid expansion, they  are still high compared with the incomes of local entrepreneurs - who might  be expected to finance and run such grids. There are a variety of ways to  address the high costs of electricity from mini-grids, but they all require the  creation of bespoke energy systems, which limit the technology’s ability to be  deployed for mass electrification. This challenge is exacerbated by the  current lack of technically trained personnel in sub-Saharan Africa who could  design and maintain such energy systems.  3. Solar home systems (SHSs). SHSs can supply electricity to isolated  households that are too dispersed to be connected through mini-grids.  However, SHSs suffer from limited capacity, which is sufficient only for  lighting, information and communication technologies (ICTs), entertainment,  and cooling. In addition, electricity from SHSs is more expensive than  electricity from both the grid and mini-grids. Although SHSs can provide  households with basic quantities of electricity, they can also suffer from  regulatory issues and be compromised in conditions where theft of solar  panels is a problem and where demand on the system grows rapidly.  4. Solar appliances. Solar appliances provide electrification on an even smaller  scale than SHSs and therefore result in the lowest up-front cost, but also the  highest cost of electricity of all the technologies mentioned here.  Nonetheless, given the high value placed on electrical energy for lighting,  electronics, and cooling, solar appliances have been observed to generate  rapid transitions in household energy economies. Challenges around  promoting solar appliances pertain to ensuring their quality and socializing  people to the potential advantages of electric energy sources.   8  Although access to electricity has received a disproportionate amount of attention  within energy access efforts, electrification alone—whether supplied via the grid  or distributed technologies—has only limited effects on energy poverty.  1. In terms of household energy poverty, households tend to use electricity for  illumination, electronic devices (ICTs and entertainment), and some cooling.  Newly connected households do not tend to use electricity to meet their  thermal energy needs (cooking and heating).  2. Regarding the impacts of electrification on economic development, the  empirical literature is ambiguous. Some cases document generalizable and  significant improvements in household incomes as a result of electrification;  other empirical works find that electrification has few, if any, impacts on  economic development. Overall, I take this to mean that electricity can play  an important role in driving economic development, but this role depends on  the existence of complementary policies, infrastructure, and services.  3. The impact of electrification on the availability of services (such as street  lighting, schools, and clinics) is not well studied in the literature. The greatest  impact appears to result from the improved quality of life made possible by  electrification, which makes trained service providers (teachers, nurses,  government bureaucrats) more willing to reside in remote rural areas.  Overall, while electrification is expected to lead to important improvements in  welfare as well as some conditional economic development, it will not address  the dangers of cooking with solid and liquid fuels. Efforts to tackle energy poverty  therefore must go beyond electrification only.  Promoting access to improved cookstoves and more modern cooking fuels have  been the mainstays of efforts to address the challenges of cooking with solid  biomass. Although improved cookstoves are relatively cheap and simple  technologies and have been a focus of development efforts for more than years, their uptake has been frustratingly slow. Efforts to promote improved  cookstoves have been bolstered recently by international efforts such as the  Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, but more still needs to be done to ensure  access to improved cooking facilities in households. Promoting modern fuels  requires the use of modern appliances—and therefore suffers the same  challenges as improved cookstoves—but is also frustrated by supply chain  problems. In addition, efforts to promote access to modern fuels through  subsidies have been shown to raise complicated problems of leakage to nonpoor  groups.  Biogas digesters have been touted as a potential alternative source of energy  for cooking, but efforts to promote biodigesters have proven that, despite the  simplicity of the technology, they are difficult to roll out for the purposes of  promoting energy access. Their maintenance has also proved challenging.  9 Addressing energy poverty  With this array of technical opportunities for addressing energy poverty, the  following issues will be important for policy advocates focused on improving  energy access and addressing energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa:  1. Efforts to address energy poverty will need to focus on both the grid and  distributed technologies. The grid will provide the cheapest energy and  allow for the greatest penetration of renewables at the lowest cost. Rolling it  out, however, will be costly and slow, so distributed generation technologies  should be used to help increase access to electricity. To this end, energy  policies should promote a mix of technologies based on considerations such  as population and income density, distance from the grid, resource  availability, and terrain.  2. Support for distributed technologies must not only cover the higher upfront  costs for the technology, but also support the development of the  entire supply chain. This means reducing the cost of renewable  components and offering appropriate training to the individuals who will be  needed to site, install, manage, and maintain these systems.  3. To support the expansion of the grid, energy policy will need to focus on  reducing the cost of connections. In addition, because the arrival of the  grid threatens the sustainability of distributed technologies, plans for grid  expansion need to be transparent, with explicit mechanisms for  integrating distributed technologies into the grid when it arrives.  4. To ensure that electrification is sustainable, it must be accompanied by  economic development. Electrification thus needs to be undertaken  within the context of a broader set of development efforts. This will  include making sure that complementary services, infrastructure, and policies  are rolled out along with electricity access.  5. Even if policies effectively address all of the above challenges, the poorest  households will still likely require subsidies in order to meet their basic energy  needs. At the same time, tariffs will have to be set high enough to ensure the  long-term sustainability of any energy infrastructure. In this respect a central  feature of energy policy will be striking the correct balance between tariff  rates and subsidies.  6. Although developments in renewable energy technologies are changing the  possibilities for improving electricity access, there is a danger that advocacy  communities will focus solely on the technologies of energy delivery and  ignore the institutional context. Experience rolling out these new technologies  suggests that the institutional context will remain of central importance, and  thus core development concerns about governance and accountability  should remain priorities, regardless of the technology being deployed.   7. Policy makers have long prioritized electrification over addressing energy  needs for cooking, and current efforts promoting improved cookstoves will  likely be insufficient to address energy poverty. The number of people  cooking with traditional biomass is expected to increase through 2030.  Because biomass is expected to play a significant role in household energy  economies, energy policy should include an explicit effort to manage  solid biomass in a sustainable way.  8. Issues of financing will lie at the heart of efforts to roll out energy access.  Financing will be needed not only for new infrastructure, but also for  subsidies to support energy access among the poorest populations. At the  moment, public and donor financing is insufficient to meet the investment  needs, and as such there is an imperative to use public and donor finance  to leverage private investment.  11 Addressing energy poverty  1. INTRODUCTION  Access to energy is fundamental to human welfare. We need energy to cook our  food and heat our homes. We use illumination after the sun goes down to extend  our productive hours and provide us with huge improvements in quality of life.  Beyond these basic functions, we rely on energy to provide services such as  telecommunications, health care, and education as well as many of the  conveniences available to people in modern economies. Without access to  modern and efficient fuels, households are forced to rely on polluting and  dangerous sources of energy such as the burning of dung, charcoal, and  kerosene.  Energy poverty presents a serious challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite  longstanding efforts to address energy poverty, in 2014, 633 million people  lacked access to electricity and 792 million people relied on traditional biomass  as their primary energy source for cooking (IEA, 2016). The result is drudgery,  poisoning, fires, burns, limited economic opportunity, and premature death due to  respiratory diseases.  Whereas developing Asia contains the largest number of people without access  to modern cooking facilities, sub-Saharan Africa contains the largest number  without access to electricity. Sub-Saharan Africa is also home to the largest  number of countries with the lowest rates of electrification and has the highest  rates of people forced to cook using traditional biomass. Furthermore, whereas  Asia is expected to see declines in the total number of people living in energy  poverty, in sub-Saharan Africa population growth is outstripping the rate at which  people are transitioning away from solid biomass for cooking. Based on current  trends, the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are forced to burn solid  biomass in unimproved cookstoves is expected to rise to 823 million by 2030.  Notably, however, recent efforts focusing on electrification are expected to drive  down the number of people lacking electricity through to 2040 (see Table 1).  Table 1: Predicted changes in energy-poor populations in sub-Saharan  Africa, 2014–202014 2030 20Number of people without access to electricity (millions) 633 619 4Number of people reliant on traditional biomass for  cooking (millions)  792 823 7Source: IEA, 2016.   When considering the state of energy access and energy poverty in sub-Saharan  Africa, it is important to remember that regional and national averages can  obscure vast disparities in levels of energy access between and within countries.  Some countries, such as South Sudan and Burundi, have electrification rates in  the single digits, whereas the small island states of Mauritius and the Seychelles  have energy access rates of 100 percent (see Figure 1).  Figure 1: Rates of electricity access across sub-Saharan Africa countries  13 Addressing energy poverty  More needs to be done to address energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet  Africa faces challenges in using fossil fuels to generate electricity. Fossil fuels  are susceptible to major variations in price that have significant impacts on the  economic viability of electricity production. Burning fossil fuels in power plants  creates significant health risks as a result of dangerous smog. Finally, the  burning of fossil fuels drives climate change, which threatens to compromise food  security, drive sea-level rise, exacerbate drought and flood events, and increase  exposure to disease (Boko et al., 2007; Goodes, 2011; Kundzewicz et al., 2007;  Nicholls & Mimura, 1998; Schlenker & Lobell, 2010; Tanser et al., 2003).  Although Africa’s limited role in driving climate change means that the its citizens  should not shoulder the burden of addressing it—especially not when considering  the grave levels of impoverishment represented by current levels of energy  poverty—Africa’s vulnerability to climate change does give it a real incentive to  seek to minimize its greenhouse gas emissions where possible.  While the task of addressing energy poverty and limiting greenhouse gas  emissions seems daunting, price reductions in a number of renewable energy  technologies are creating new possibilities for achieving energy access in Africa,  and as such the policy discussion over how best to prioritize energy investments  is changing rapidly. Many actors now call for a complete overhaul of the  traditional focus on investing in centralized power generation and expanding the  grid. Instead, they call for a focus on distributed renewable energy technologies,  which are believed to be cheaper, faster to deploy, and not reliant on the slow  and bureaucratic power utilities that have served African countries so poorly in  the past. In addition, such energy sources are thought to mitigate the local  emissions from large, centralized, fossil fuel–burning power stations, which  currently impose major health costs on surrounding communities. Other actors  reject this argument, suggesting that a distributed approach is incapable of  supplying power in the quantities required. Assessing the merits of these  arguments is challenging owing to the technical characteristics of energy  technologies, the rapidly changing prices of renewable components, and the  complex economics and financing questions that dominate the energy sector.  This is the context that frames this report. The report sets out to review the  challenges posed by energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa and explore the  possibilities for addressing it while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. The  report is intended to be an accessible appraisal of potential technologies and  approaches for expanding access to electricity, including grid expansion and  distributed technologies. The report also considers the potential for improved  cookstoves to provide people with access to safe cooking facilities. In all cases  the report emphasizes the challenges surrounding the available technologies and  highlights the policy requirements for addressing such challenges. In this respect,  this report is intended as a guide to advocates and policy makers as it seeks to   explain the technical, economic, and policy challenges surrounding energy  access in Africa.  The work is based on a six-month review of the literature on energy poverty and  energy access. This report (Part 2) on energy poverty is intended to complement  another Oxfam report exploring the challenges of closing the energy gap in Africa  and the need to minimize the use of fossil fuels in that process. That report,  referenced in this work as Part 1, can be found where this report was  downloaded.  HOW TO READ THIS REPORT  Because this report is a comprehensive account of the opportunities and  challenges for addressing energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, different  readers with different levels of understanding of the issues will find different parts  of the report interesting and relevant. As such, the report need not be read as a  single document, but can be read selectively according to readers’ interests.  The report is structured as follows: Section 2 of the report, intended for people  with no background in the subject matter, details the conceptual and definitional  aspects of energy poverty and energy access. The principal technical section of  the report, Section 3, describes the technical opportunities and challenges posed  by different electricity technologies including grid expansion, mini-grids, solar  home systems, and solar appliances (the role of biodigesters is discussed in Text  Box 5, located in Section 5). Section 4 reviews the empirical evidence on the  impacts of electricity on human and economic development, before Section 5  makes the case for focusing on solid biomass fuels when addressing energy  poverty. Section 6 discusses vital areas of policy focus that need to be resolved  or considered in any energy access policy. Finally, Section 7 concludes with  important areas of policy focus for advocates and policy makers.  15 Addressing energy poverty  2. ENERGY POVERTY AND  ENERGY ACCESS  The term “energy poverty” has no formally agreed definition. Usually, the term  focuses on household energy use, such as energy for cooking, lighting, and  heating. More recently, however, the notion of energy poverty has been  expanded to include both the energy needed for small-scale commercial activity  (such as energy needed to run appliances in a small business) and energy for  services (such as street lights and health clinics) (Practical Action, 2014). Work  on energy poverty usually excludes discussion of the energy provided by nutrition  and the energy needed for transportation.  Energy poverty tends to be understood in two main ways. The first is the idea of  energy poverty as the energy consumption habits of populations who are  deemed poor by other measures, such as income (Khandker et al., 2010). The  second idea is that energy poverty is itself a form of deprivation, so that energypoor  populations are those that lack access to the energy required to meet their  basic needs (Bhattacharyya, 2012; Khandker et al., 2010; Practical Action,  2014). In the latter case, the notion of energy poverty is also thought to account  for the fact that many populations must expose themselves to undue risks (such  as risks from pollution) or hardships (such as having to walk long distances and  expend significant amounts of time collecting fuelwood) in order to meet their  basic energy needs.  ENERGY POVERTY AS THE ENERGY USE OF THE  POOR  Energy poverty—when understood as the energy usage habits of poor  households—highlights the extent to which poor people spend a greater portion  of their income and time meeting their energy needs than do wealthy  households, despite the fact that wealthy households tend to consume more  energy overall (Bacon et al., 2010; Khandker et al., 2010). The reason for this is  that all people, no matter how poor, need some basic amount of energy to  survive. Among very poor households, accessing even the small amount of  energy needed for survival can mean spending a greater proportion of their  income on energy than the proportion spent by wealthy households that  consume much more energy. Poor households are also often forced to rely on  fuels and appliances that are less efficient than those available to wealthy  populations. As a result, they often have to spend more time and money to meet   their most basic energy needs. Empirical investigation has revealed that poor  households spend somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of their income on  meeting their energy needs (Africa Progress Panel, 2015; Clancy, 2006;  Khandker et al., 2010). The most commonly used measure of energy poverty is  households that spend more than 10 percent of their income on meeting their  energy needs (Khandker et al., 2010).  As high as they are, these measures of expenditure do not capture the extra time  poor households spend to meet their energy needs, nor do they account for the  fact that, in developing countries, poor households often collect their own fuels  (and therefore don’t pay for them). Thus, even these high figures may  underrepresent the extent of energy poverty in less industrialized countries.  ENERGY POVERTY AS DEPRIVATION  The second conception of energy poverty—as the experience of deprivation or  exposure to undue risks or hardships—has driven an important focus on the  notion of “energy services.” The idea here is that the availability of energy itself  (i.e., potential energy, or kinetic energy) has no direct impact on human wellbeing.  However, when that energy is able to provide services, such as heat for  cooking or light for illumination, it can have a profound effect on human wellbeing.  What matters when addressing energy poverty is providing people with  the energy services required to meet their basic needs.  Focusing on energy services makes clear that definitions of energy poverty are  both context specific and subjective (Bhattacharyya, 2012). This is because  people in different circumstances need different amounts of energy to meet their  basic needs (for example, people in cold climates need more energy to heat their  homes than do people in warm climates) and because exactly what constitutes a  need (or an undue risk) is itself fundamentally subjective (Bhattacharyya, 2012).  Although definitions of energy poverty have been hard to come by and  contentious when offered (Bhattacharyya, 2012), a prominent effort has recently  come from Practical Action, which suggests defining energy poverty as  deprivation of “the full range of energy supplies and services required to support  human social and economic development …[for]… households, enterprises and  community service providers” (Practical Action, 2014, p. 2). Beyond this,  Practical Action (2014) has provided a set of basic thresholds for energy services  against which energy poverty might be defined. These thresholds pertain to  illumination, thermal energy, cooling, refrigeration, and access to information and  communications technology. The thresholds include metrics related to both risk  and opportunity cost (Practical Action, 2014).  17 Addressing energy poverty  THE IMPACTS OF ENERGY POVERTY  Energy poverty poses a substantial challenge for development. If people lack the  ability to light their homes after sunset, activities such as studying, domestic  chores, and even small business endeavors must end when the sun goes down.  Likewise, if people are unable to warm or cool their houses, they can be left very  uncomfortable at certain times of the year, with particular risks to the very young  and very old. Further, when populations living in energy poverty do gain access  to fuels, they often risk significant harm. For example, the burning of traditional  biomass in people’s homes is estimated to cause 600,000 deaths annually in  sub-Saharan Africa alone (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). Unless current trends  change, deaths from indoor air pollution are forecast to exceed deaths from  tuberculosis and AIDS by 2030 (see Figure 2) (Africa Progress Panel, 2015).  Kerosene,1 which is used for cooking and lighting, is associated with respiratory  infection (though less so than cooking with solid fuels), and it also poses risks of  poisoning and fires (see Text Box 1).  Figure 2: Deaths caused by major infectious diseases compared with acute  lower respiratory infections, 2004, 2010, and 2030  Source: World Bank Group, 2012, in Africa Progress Panel, 2015.  1 Kerosene is also referred to as paraffin in some parts of the world.   Text Box 1: The dangers of kerosene  While the literature on energy poverty has much to say about the dangers of indoor air  pollution, it generally pays less attention to the dangers of home kerosene use, even  though an abundant literature on the subject points to the risks of both poisoning and  fire.  The exact incidence of unintentional kerosene poisoning across Africa is unknown  (Veale et al., 2013), but good data from studies in South Africa are instructive. There,  kerosene ingestion, is the most common cause of acute poisoning among South  Africa’s black population, and is estimated to result in as many as 171–996 fatalities a  year (Carolissen & Matzopoulos, 2004). Even nonfatal cases of poisoning (estimated at  46,530–93,060 a year) cause problems for families because they often result in long  and expensive hospital stays (Tshiamo, 2009). Aspiration of kerosene by children can  raise the likelihood of respiratory conditions such as tuberculosis and asthma later in  life (Tshiamo, 2009). Risks of kerosene poisoning are greatest among children in rural  areas, which are far from hospitals (Carolissen & Matzopoulos, 2004; Meyer et al.,  2007; Tshiamo, 2009).  Fire risk is also a major problem. In South Africa alone, 200,000 individuals are  estimated to be injured by, or lose property as a result of, kerosene-related fires.  Kerosene is identified as the cause of fire in 53 percent of cases (candles account for  another 30 percent of cases) (Kimemia et al., 2014).  On top of these difficulties, the time spent collecting fuelwood and cooking food  on unimproved stoves places an additional burden on energy-poor populations.  The losses in Africa due to cooking and collecting firewood are estimated at  $36.9 billion annually, if the value of unpaid labor is included. The impacts are  greatest among women and girls, who are usually responsible for these chores  (Lambe et al., 2015). Moreover, these impacts take place within a context in  which women and girls already bear a disproportionate burden of the unpaid  work within the household (Karimli et al., n.d.). Finally a lack of access to energy  compromises the efficacy of social services, such as clinics and schools, and  limits economic opportunities by constraining productivity and economic growth  (Modi et al., 2006).  19 Addressing energy poverty  Figure 3: The largest populations cooking with traditional biomass in sub-  Saharan Africa, 2012  Source IEA, 2014, reproduced from Lambe et al., 2015.  Given the challenges of energy poverty, providing energy to households in safe  and sufficient quantities is hypothesized to result in myriad positive outcomes,2  including the following:  • Improved health outcomes: Reduced burning of biomass and kerosene in  homes will reduce people’s exposure to harmful pollutants. Access to modern  fuels is expected to help prevent the cuts, falls, bites, and episodes of sexual  harassment and assault that women and girls might otherwise sustain while  collecting fuelwood. Finally, access to electricity allows for improvements to  the cold chain, which are believed to be vital for vaccination, and access to  electrified clinics is anticipated to improve health outcomes.  • Increased household income: Households that purchase modern fuels are  expected to reap savings from the use of more efficient fuels. Access to  sufficient illumination will give households more productive hours, including  increased study hours for students. Finally, access to modern fuels allows for  pumped irrigation, potentially improving farm incomes, as well as for the  diversification of income as households engage in agroprocessing and  undertake light manufacturing.  2 See Modi et al. 2006 and Practical Action 2014 for a comprehensive account of the potential  positive outcomes of providing energy services and addressing energy poverty. Much of this list  is generated from these two reports.   • Improved environmental outcomes: Reduced demand for biofuels will  lessen pressures on forests (Lewis & Pattanayak, 2012), with positive  impacts for forest services including reducing runoff and climate change  mitigation.  • Improved quality of life: Addressing households’ reliance on fuelwood will  reduce the drudgery experienced by women and girls whose job it is to collect  those fuels. Greater access to entertainment services requiring electricity will  improve people’s well-being.  • Access to ICTs and improved services: Most ICTs require electricity to  operate. The impact of television, radio, cell phones, and computers on  people’s lives will be significant. They can increase productivity, provide  people with access to crucial information, and create new industries. In terms  of services, schools, clinics, and government offices are all thought to be  made more effective by access to electricity, with important impacts for the  well-being of people who access them. Finally, improved quality of life in rural  areas is expected to help retain qualified staff (such as teachers, nurses,  bureaucrats), which will further improve access to services.  ENERGY ACCESS  Efforts to address energy poverty have focused on providing energy access. As  with energy poverty, until recently there has been little agreement on how to  define “energy access” beyond a general sentiment that it includes increasing  households’ access to sufficient quantities of energy while ensuring that they can  avoid unnecessary risk or undue drudgery (Bhattacharyya, 2012). The  vagueness of the term has not, however, diminished efforts to promote energy  access. Given the myriad potential benefits mentioned above, it has been a  mainstay of government policy in many countries.  Electricity has come to play a central role in energy access owing to its particular  ability to provide an enormous array of energy services (see Text Box 2). As a  consequence, efforts to promote energy access have often been reduced to a  narrow focus on providing access to electricity. One result has been a binary  view of energy access in which people are either “connected” or “not connected”  (Practical Action, 2014).  This narrow, binary approach belies the complexity of how people actually  consume energy. To understand why consider a household that is connected to  a source of electricity so unreliable that it has access to energy services for only  four hours a day. Or imagine a household that has access to electricity but is  unable to afford to pay for the service. Under such conditions, households may  still find themselves cooking or lighting their homes using solid fuels, with the  21 Addressing energy poverty  associated dangers, disadvantages, and drudgery. As such, simply focusing on  whether or not households are connected to electricity is a poor indicator of  whether they have access to the energy they need to avoid the deprivations,  risks, and injustices associated with energy poverty.  Text box 2: Electricity and energy services  What people require to improve their well-being is not simply energy, but energy  services. To understand this, consider the chemical energy contained in solid  biomass, or the kinetic energy in a wire carrying an electrical current: By itself, such  energy is of little value for improving a person’s well-being.  Instead, when people have access to, for example, the light generated by passing an  electric current through a filament or by burning kerosene, their productive hours are  not limited to daylight hours. Likewise, when people are able to access the heat  created by passing an electric current through an element or by burning wood or  charcoal, they can cook their food and heat their homes. Given that addressing  energy poverty is about improving well-being, energy access is about providing  people with access to energy services.  When it comes to delivering energy services, electricity has distinct advantages. First,  electricity can provide virtually all the services that a household might use. It can  provide heat, light, and telecommunications, and even run machinery. In addition,  unlike a fire, which takes time to light and burn down to embers, electricity can provide  those services almost instantly; users need only turn it on. Finally, electricity is able to  provide services while producing almost no emissions at the point of consumption,  and it is relatively safe to use.  Electricity presents other advantages as well. It is easier to transport than solid or  liquid fuels like charcoal and diesel, which must be moved along roadways. As long as  two areas are connected to one another, electricity can be provided to either one  almost instantly.  Yet using electricity to provide energy services to the poor also presents a few  disadvantages. First, households have to be connected to electricity in order to  receive it. Second, using electricity to access energy services requires owning an  appropriate appliance—an electric stove, kettle or lightbulb—which can be costly. In  contrast, a basic stove for burning wood or charcoal can be made from nothing more  than three large stones. In addition, for electricity to provide these services, the supply  of electricity must be both sufficient and reliable.  Energy access policy has frequently focused on only the first of these issues:  connecting households. This has led to an overly simplified account of energy access.  As a result, there has been a recent push to develop more comprehensive  measures of energy access that capture the multidimensional and multi-tiered   nature of the term. This has included tiered considerations of the energy’s (1)  capacity, (2) duration and availability, (3) reliability, (4) quality, (5) affordability,  (6) legality, (7) convenience, and (8) health and safety. For each category the  energy source is broken down into energy for household electricity and energy  for household cooking (World Bank Group, 2012) (see Figure 4). Despite this  more comprehensive approach, imperatives to see people rise above the most  basic level of access, and to create energy access goals against which progress  can be measured, have driven a push back toward a binary definition whereby  some tier within the energy access matrix is considered the basic threshold for  “energy access.”  Figure 4: Multi-tier matrix of energy access  Source: World Bank Group, 2014.  In summary, the field of endeavor linking energy and development has been  animated by concerns about the impacts of energy poverty and a desire to  address these by promoting energy access. Despite the longstanding focus on  both issues, neither has a clearly established definition, although recent efforts to  provide nuanced definitions that capture the complexity of these issues have  been advanced. Policy advocates in this field have found it challenging to move  the conversation beyond a simple focus on electrification as a means to address  energy poverty, and the binary definitions of energy access this focus has  created.  23 Addressing energy poverty  3. EXPANDING ACCESS TO  ELECTRICITY  Traditionally electricity has been provided to households through connections  that link households to centralized power plants. The interconnection of all of  these households into one large energy system is known as the electricity grid, or  simply “the grid.” The grid has advantages (principally around economies of  scale) and disadvantages (principally around high up-front costs) when it comes  to expanding energy access. Frustration at the disadvantages, along with  growing cognizance of the challenge of climate change and advances in  renewable energy technologies, has driven an increasing focus on providing  electricity through distributed sources. Under this model, instead of being  connected to a single centralized generating source, households are connected  to distributed sources, which are close to the point of consumption, largely  renewable, and not connected to one another through the main grid. Such  systems have the advantage of being able to reach poor and remote populations  quickly and cheaply (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Deshmukh et al., 2013; TERIGNESD,  2014; Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2014), while simultaneously mitigating  carbon emissions (Alstone et al., 2015).  Text Box 3: Electricity fundamentals  Electricity is generated in power stations. The electricity from the power station is  transmitted to households or other users through a set of wires that can carry electric  current at different voltages. The linking up of many households through an  interconnected system of wires is known as the electricity grid. Any set of  interconnected households can be thought of as a grid, but some grids can be very  large, connecting entire countries, while mini-grids can be small, connecting just a few  households.  Dispatchable and Intermittent Sources  The sources of energy for producing electricity are classified into two major types:  dispatchable and intermittent. Dispatchable sources of energy can be turned on or off  whenever the person managing the plant wishes. Intermittent sources of energy are  not available all the time; their availability is determined by factors beyond the control  of the plant manager. Fossil-fuel plants provide dispatchable energy (so long as the  fuel is available), while sources such as wind and solar are intermittent, available only  when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. Some low-carbon sources of energy  are dispatchable, such as hydroelectric power (assuming water levels are sufficient)  and nuclear power.   Alternating and Direct Current  Electricity is generated in two principal forms: alternating current (AC) and direct  current (DC). Individual appliances are built to handle one type of current only.  Electric current can be transformed from one form to another, though it is easier to  transform AC to DC than it is to transform DC to AC. The grid uses AC because large  power stations tend to produce AC (except in the case of solar PV, which produces  DC). It is more efficient to transport AC at high voltages, and it is possible to increase  or decrease the voltage of AC with relative ease via a transformer, though this step  involves losses of energy.  In general, electricity is generated at relatively low voltages. Voltages are then  “stepped up” to very high levels as electricity is transported long distances through  high-voltage power lines known as the transmission network. High voltages, however,  are dangerous in households, so voltages are “stepped down” to lower levels as  electricity is delivered to households through low-voltage power lines known as the  distribution network.  AC can be delivered through either three-phase or single-phase current (these terms  describe the timing with which alternating current alternates). Three-phase current,  which is more efficient and uses less electricity to run an appliance, is more common  in electrical grids around the world.  Matching Demand and Supply  One major downside to using electricity to provide energy services is that energy  cannot be stored as electricity. This means that the amount of electricity being  produced needs to be balanced with the amount being consumed; any excess  electricity is wasted. Given that demand varies during the day—usually with a large  peak in the early evening as users come home and start cooking, heating their  homes, and turning on their lights—such balancing is central to the management of  electricity generation.  Patterns of usage with large peaks create challenges for electricity systems. Systems  must have enough generation capacity—that is, a sufficient number of power plants—  to meet peak demand, even if this demand lasts for only a short period of the day.  This makes it difficult to finance generation capacity because power plants rely on the  sale of electricity to make money. Cases in which peak demand is much greater than  average demand cause the whole electricity system to be more expensive as capacity  sits unused for long periods of time. Consequently there are good reasons to try to  smooth out peak demand so that more of the energy generation capacity is being  used more of the time, resulting in a more efficient use of the grid’s resources.  The problem of having too little electricity when demand is high is matched by the  problem of having too much electricity when demand is low (for example, if the wind is  blowing on wind turbines in the middle of the night). In such circumstances, energy  generation capacity has to be curtailed (i.e., switched off). Curtailment makes  financing renewable projects more difficult because, as mentioned, generators make  most of their money by selling electricity, not by generating it. If they cannot sell the  electricity they generate because there is no demand, then recouping a profit on  25 Addressing energy poverty  those assets is more difficult.  Resolving Intermittency  The fact that energy cannot be stored as electricity poses additional challenges for  intermittent energy sources. When demand does not coincide with sunny or windy  conditions, users must (1) go without electricity, (2) get electricity from somewhere  where the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, or (3) have access to a dispatchable  source of electricity. This source could be a fossil fuel, a dispatchable renewable  source (such as hydropower), or stored energy that was generated when the  intermittent energy source was available (such as a battery or pumped water  storage).  All of the options for resolving intermittency raise challenges. Going without electricity  (especially if outages are unplanned) often imposes significant economic losses and  social costs. Transporting electricity across a grid involves energy losses of at least 6  percent (in Africa the losses can be even higher, between 15 and 30 percent) and  requires the presence of expensive grid infrastructure. Furthermore, using the grid as  a form of backup is only effective when the grid is large enough to have significant  diversity in demand and generation. Small grids are vulnerable to fluctuations in both  demand and generation and therefore have greater needs for storage and/or backup  in order to deal with intermittency.  The use of fossil fuels as a backup causes climate change and has other social costs  (such as the health costs associated with pollution from burning fossil fuels). The  variability of fossil-fuel prices also means that electricity prices can fluctuate, creating  shocks for the users. Finally, in remote areas, access to fossil fuels can be unreliable.  In such cases fossil-fuel generation sources are not viable as a backup to intermittent  sources.  Finally, storage is expensive. Batteries are a promising option, but in addition to being  expensive, they must be carefully maintained to ensure their longevity. Although lead-acid  batteries are a proven technology and are relatively cheap, even when carefully  managed their life expectancy is much less than that of other renewable components,  such as solar panels. In addition, effective management means limiting how deeply  one discharges the batteries. For lead-acid batteries, limiting battery discharge to 20  percent provides for the longest battery life, but limiting discharge to that extent  means that more batteries are needed to achieve the same amount of overall storage  capacity in a system. Lithium-ion batteries allow for greater depth of discharge  (around 80 percent) and more charge cycles, and thus a longer life, but they have  much higher costs than lead-acid batteries (IRENA, 2016b). In general, batteries of  any type should not be fully discharged, or discharged too quickly. Doing so  decreases their life span, which—given the cost of batteries—can substantially  increase the cost of the overall electricity system.  Another solution to the storage challenge is pumped storage, in which water is  pumped up a hill and then stored before it runs down over a generator. In order for  pumped storage to be cost-effective, an area must be proximate to high ground on  which reservoirs can be built.   Such a broad overview of electricity generation technologies ignores, however,  the detailed technical and economic complexities of generating and distributing  electricity. A lack of understanding about these technical challenges, and  therefore about the associated institutional challenges, has resulted in polarized  and simplistic discussions about the capacity for different approaches to provide  electricity and address energy poverty. This section of the report focuses on four  potential electricity generation and distribution technologies, looking at the  specific advantages, opportunities, and challenges associated with each. The  report considers four dominant approaches: (1) connecting households by  expanding the grid, (2) providing electricity via mini-grids, (3) providing electricity  via solar home systems (SHSs), and (4) providing energy services via the sale of  solar appliances. Once the case has been made for ensuring that households  have energy for thermal needs such as cooking and heating, the report also  discusses the potential for biodigesters to address energy poverty (Text Box 5).  EXPANDING THE GRID  All countries that have significantly increased their electrification rates in recent  years have done so by expanding the grid to connect unelectrified households  (e.g., China, Vietnam, Philippines, and South Africa) (Bhattacharyya, 2012;  Dinkelman, 2011; Khandker et al., 2009b; Modi et al., 2006). Compared with  other technologies, the grid is uniquely able to take advantage of economies of  Terminology  Finally some energy terminology: Energy is measured in joules (j), while power is  measured in watts (W). Power is the rate at which energy is converted from one form  to another and is measured in joules per second (W = jt; where “t” = time in  seconds). Electric power stations convert energy from one source (a fuel) into  electricity at a given rate; as a result their capacity (or power) is expressed in watts  based on the rate at which they produce electricity. Quantities of electricity are  measured in watt-hours. One watt-hour is the amount of energy used when a one-watt  appliance is run for one hour (note that watt-hours can also be expressed in  joules, as both are quantities of energy, but a joule is such a small unit of  measurement that using it is unwieldy). The most common measures of electrical  energy are kilowatt- and megawatt-hours (kWh or mWh), and thus energy prices are  usually set in terms of the price per kWh ($/kWh).  The cost of different electrical generation systems is most effectively expressed as  the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The LCOE is determined by dividing the total  cost of a generating system (including any necessary fuel, replacement parts,  maintenance and decommissioning costs) and dividing it by the total amount of  energy the system will generate over its lifetime. LCOE is measured in $/kWh or  $/mWh.  27 Addressing energy poverty  scale by connecting many people to a single piece of infrastructure (ARE, n.d.).  Because the cost of expanding the grid is shared by all of the connected  customers, the grid provides electricity at the lowest retail price of all the  technologies (see Text Box 4). The grid can also provide electricity in very large  quantities and at very high voltages, which some industrial users require. Finally,  because the grid is the dominant way that households receive electricity around  the world, it has the advantage of being a well-understood technology with  blueprints for how to finance and build the necessary infrastructure, as well as  how to sell electricity. The institutional requirements and challenges involved in  operating and managing such a large piece of infrastructure are also well known.  Challenges to expanding the grid  Grid expansion also involves a number of challenges. Foremost among these are  the high up-front costs of extending the grid and the high cost of connecting  individual households (ARE, n.d.; Hogarth & Granoff, 2015). The World Bank–  administered Energy Sector Management Assistance Program estimated the  cost of expanding the grid at $8,000–$10,000 per kilometer in 2000.3 The  majority of these costs ($7,000) were for equipment, with poles and then  conductors being the most expensive components (ESMAP, 2000). Such high  costs and the fact that it takes advantage of economies of scale mean that the  grid is well suited to serving densely populated areas in which people can afford  to connect to the grid and pay for electricity in fairly large quantities. It also  means, however, that the grid is poorly suited to supplying electricity to sparsely  populated, poor, and remote areas, where only small amounts of electricity will  be consumed. This is especially the case if these populations reside in  challenging terrain where the necessary infrastructure is difficult to build and  maintain (ARE, n.d.). Notably, much of sub-Saharan Africa’s rural population has  these challenging characteristics: low density, low incomes, and low levels of  demand. In addition, the current extent of the grid is extremely limited in much of  sub-Saharan Africa, so expansion plans would need to be ambitious.  Moreover, simply connecting households to the grid will improve their access to  energy only insofar as the gird infrastructure is reliable and the generating  capacity on the grid is sufficient to meet demand. In sub-Saharan Africa, most  countries are currently experiencing a generation shortfall (see Part 1 of this  series). Expanding people’s access to an unreliable grid, without addressing  capacity problems, is only likely to place greater demands on the system and  make the grid less reliable for everyone who is already connected  (Bhattacharyya, 2012; Murphy et al., 2014). Finally, because of the centralized  nature of the grid, the overall infrastructure is vulnerable to localized impacts so  that damage to one part of the grid (caused, for example, by severe weather or  3 It was estimated that this figure could be brought down to about $5,000 over normal terrain in  developing countries.   the breakdown of a single large generator) can proliferate and bring down the  entire system.  In addition, because the grid approximates a perfect monopoly (with high capital  costs and low marginal costs), it is not amenable to private competition and is  therefore best managed by a regulated utility. In contexts where regulation is  weak, as it is in much of sub-Saharan Africa, utilities have tended to  underperform (see the section on Tariffs below) and have even become major  sites of patronage (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). In the context of an  unresponsive utility, electrification through grid expansion is highly unlikely,  especially into areas that are politically and economically marginal (ARE, n.d.).  Historically the grid has been powered by fossil fuels, which has significant  implications for climate change, but this does not need to be the case. It is  technically feasible for the grid to integrate large quantities of renewables (see  Part 1 of this series). In this respect the grid actually presents an important  advantage for renewable energy because its geographic extent allows for the  integration of a greater diversity of supply and consumption (see Text Box 3).  Grid: Solutions  Efforts to address the challenges involved in rolling out the grid have focused on  bringing down the costs of connecting to the grid by using cheaper materials  (e.g., bamboo) in transmission and distribution networks (see Text Box 3) and  through the use of “ready boards” to reduce the cost of household wiring  (Mostert, 2008). Other options for reducing connection costs include bulk  purchasing of the materials needed for the distribution network (Modi et al.,  2006).  Countries have also sought to innovate to get around the problems of corrupt or  dysfunctional energy utilities. Their efforts have principally involved reforming the  utility, largely through commercialization and the introduction of competition. The  hope is that such reforms will “improve the technical, commercial, and financial  performance of utilities; boost sector cash flow; facilitate mobilization of  resources for capital investment on a commercial basis, thereby releasing public  funds for other investments; and extend access to electricity to poor and rural  communities” (World Bank, 2005, p. 1).  The impact of these reforms on poor people has been difficult to assess. Many  countries have seen rates of access to electricity increase in the wake of reform,  but these advances are thought to have been driven more by government  policies, programs, and subsidies that have sought to connect households and  reduce tariffs than they have by the reform efforts themselves (World Bank,  2005). Critics of utility reform argue that it has limited impacts on access because  private sector participation tends to result in tariff increases as the private utility  seeks to improve its financial standing. In addition, introducing a profit motive to  29 Addressing energy poverty  the utility causes it to focus on providing electricity to communities that are  already connected and proven to be profitable or that can be connected at a low  cost. Such a focus comes at the expense of efforts to expand access to currently  poor and unconnected areas (Mostert, 2008; Scott et al., 2003). On the other  hand, proponents of reform point out that no African country has completely  unbundled its utility, and thus impacts on price and access have not been fully  realized (Eberhard et al., 2008; World Bank, 2005).  In addition to reform, innovations related to utilities have focused on improving  and simplifying bill collection by installing prepaid metering or by imposing flat  tariffs and installing load limiters (which limit how much energy any household  can use) instead of meters (Mostert, 2008). In other cases countries have sought  to outsource functions in which the utility does not have a natural comparative  advantage, such as meter reading and bill collection (Mostert, 2008). In some  cases countries have even outsourced the retailing of electricity, creating a  system in which wholesalers purchase electricity from the grid and then sell it to  customers directly4 (Scott et al., 2003). This model has helped improve access in  Phnom Penh, but regulation of the wholesalers has proved difficult, so much so  that some households were being charged up to three times the standard tariff.  As a result there have been calls to abandon the program (Scott et al., 2003).  Because of the cost of expanding the grid to Africa’s sparse and remote  population and the unresponsiveness of many African utilities, there has been a  recent push to focus on distributed generation technologies. Proponents of  distributed technologies hope that the private sector will be heavily involved,  circumventing the need to engage an unresponsive utility.  4 In many African cities, households that are connected to the grid sell power to their neighbors  (usually in informal dwellings) through unregulated connections via an extension cord (Mostert,  2008).    MINI-GRIDS  Mini-grids refer to a variety of electricity generation systems drawing on a variety  of sources, including solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, small-scale hydropower, and  fossil fuels (usually in the form of a diesel generator), or some combination of  these. Mini-grids connect a number of households and/or services to a  generation point. They can provide power at a variety of scales, ranging from  very small amounts for limited hours of the day to large amounts comparable to  those consumed by grid users available 24 hours a day (ARE, n.d.). They can be  stand-alone systems connecting households that are remote from the grid, or  31 Addressing energy poverty  they can be connected to the grid and used to smooth out problems with grid  supply.5 Power from mini-grids can be made available in either AC or DC, and as  either single-phase (known as nano/pico-grids) or three-phase power (known as  mini-grids) (IRENA, 2016b) (see Text Box 3).  Because mini-grids and nano-grids (hereafter simply referred to as mini-grids)  can generate large quantities of electricity, they have the potential to provide  “motive power” (power to run motors and machines) that could supply small  businesses and promote economic development (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016;  Deshmukh et al., 2013; TERI-GNESD, 2014). In addition, mini-grid systems are  modular, meaning that they can be broken down into individual modules in the  form of solar panels and batteries (M. Lee et al., 2014). Consequently, systems  can initially be built with only limited generation capacity and then add capacity  as demand for electricity increases.  The cost of electricity from mini-grids varies by the generation source available  as well as the demands on the system (M. Lee et al., 2014). Micro-hydropower is  the cheapest energy source (assuming the river runs all year), but such systems  are limited to areas with appropriate geography (ARE, n.d.). Wind, although  cheap, is also highly site-specific, and careful assessment of local wind  availability is essential before making investments in wind-driven mini-grids  (ARE, n.d.). Solar PV is ubiquitously available and relatively predictable; as a  result it has been thought to offer the greatest promise for promoting energy  access via mini-grids. Given the focus on PV in Africa, the remainder of this  section will consider PV-based mini-grids.  Challenges for mini-grids  Although the initial capital requirements for mini-grids are significantly lower than  the initial capital requirements for extending the grid (Alstone et al., 2015;  Deshmukh et al., 2013; Hogarth & Granoff, 2015), the up-front costs for minigrids  are still large compared with the capital available to local entrepreneurs in  many developing countries (Bhattacharyya, 2015). The small size of mini-grids  means that they require storage, in the form of batteries, and experience few  economies of scale (see Text Box 3). The need for storage increases the overall  system cost, both because batteries themselves can be costly and because  adding batteries requires building excess generation capacity as batteries place  an extra strain on the system (Murphy et al., 2014). Owing to the diseconomies  of scale, the costs of increasing the capacity of a mini-grid must be passed on to  consumers, making the electricity from mini-grids expensive compared with that  from the grid and relative to the incomes of the populations they are intended to  serve (see Text Box 4). Finally, when mini-grids are placed in remote or hard-to-  5 Using mini-grids (which include generation capacity and storage) to smooth supply problems from  the grid has been shown to be cheaper than trying to smooth supply using batteries alone  (Murphy et al., 2014).   reach locations, maintenance costs can be high, further increasing the cost of the  overall system (Africa Progress Panel, 2015; TERI-GNESD, 2014).  Text Box 4: The cost of electricity  It is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the average LCOE for electricity  from mini-grids, for several reasons. The costs of components and labor vary across  countries, and the cost of energy from a mini-grid depends on the size of the system,  the source of the energy, and the pattern of demand placed on the system (see Text  Box 3). Research from Bangladesh (Bhattacharyya, 2015), however, which looks at  the price of energy based on different mini-grid configurations, can provide us with a  useful sense of what costs might look like.  The research modeled four types of systems, each of increasing capacity. They  ranged from a basic system that covered immediate needs (such as household  lighting, a fan, and a television, available for limited periods of the day) up to a  system that could handle relatively large household loads, as well as productive and  commercial loads, and that was available 24 hours a day.  The study used the HOMER model and considered PV-diesel hybrid mini-grids,  using component costs thought to reflect the market price for these goods in  Bangladesh. It found that for the low-capacity system, a diesel-only approach was  cheapest (assuming a diesel price of $0.6/liter, or $2.27/gallon). For this system, the  LCOE was $0.47/kWh. For larger systems, hybrid arrangements were cheapest,  resulting in a LCOE of $0.34–$0.37/kWh, with costs decreasing as the capacity of  the system went up. These numbers are comparable to theoretical resource  assessments of mini-grids in Africa (using component and labor costs from  Germany), which put the LCOE of PV mini-grids at $0.24–$0.35/kWh (€/0.18–  €/0.25kWh, in 2014) (Huld et al., 2014).  We can compare these costs with the cost of electricity from other sources (see  table below). SHSs in Bangladesh have an LCOE of about $0.72/kWh and provide  services equivalent to those of the lowest-capacity mini-grid used in the above study  (Bhattacharyya, 2012). Diesel-only mini-grids are thus a cheaper way to generate  electricity than SHSs, assuming households are suitably clustered together. On the  other hand, grid tariffs in Bangladesh are only $0.04/kWh for consumption up to  100kWh a month. When comparing these prices, we should keep in mind that in  Bangladesh these prices are based on PV-hybrid systems (with the diesel generator  contributing substantially to generation) and that purely PV systems would be more  expensive.  In Africa, where grid tariffs are so high that they are widely considered an  impediment to development, retail prices from the grid are about $0.13/kWh (World  Bank, 2013)—though they can be much higher in some cases. To get a sense of  what these numbers mean, consider that the International Energy Agency definition  of energy access suggests that an urban household needs at least 500 kWh of  electricity annually to meet its basic energy requirements for lighting,  33 Addressing energy poverty  The fact that the cost of electricity from mini-grids is generally higher than that  provided by the grid (Deshmukh et al., 2013) (see Text Box 4) creates challenges  for using mini-grids to drive increases in energy access and in human  development. First, the high cost limits the extent to which mini-grids are  accessible to the poor (TERI-GNESD, 2014; World Bank, 2008). Second, even  among populations who do get access to the electricity, high costs mean that  households tend to limit the services they are willing to access to those requiring  only small amounts of electricity (such as lighting and cell-phone charging) and  6 This average increased only $20 over the preceding 15 years and thus is unlikely to have  changed dramatically since 2008.  7 Note that the Bangladesh retail price is $0.04/kWh for consumption up to 100 kWh/month. A  consumer who uses more than 1,200 kWh/year would pay more than the $0.04/kWh tariff. Thus  this is a theoretical value.  communications, and some cooling, while a rural household needs at least 250 kWh  (IEA, n.d.). Based on the 2008 average income for an African household of $7626  (Lakner & Milanovic, 2013), 10 percent of that household budget (the income  threshold for energy poverty) would provide $76.20 for spending on energy. At minigrid  prices ($0.34/kWh), the average African household could afford only 224 kWh a  year. At average African grid prices ($0.13/kWh), the average household could  afford about 586 kWh annually.  All of this together means that the average African household could not afford to  purchase the basic electricity required for a rural household even if it spent as much  as 10 percent of its annual budget on electricity obtained from a relatively largecapacity  mini-grid. Such a household could only just meet the needs of an urban  household when buying electricity from the grid. When we consider that this 10  percent budget share excludes energy for cooking, it becomes clear just how large a  challenge energy costs present for improving energy access among poor, rural  households.  do not use electricity for productive purposes (Bhattacharyya, 2015). The high  cost of electricity from mini-grids therefore poses a significant challenge to the  profitability of mini-grids, which in turn limits interest from the private sector.  Problems of profitability are compounded by the risk of grid encroachment, which  occurs when the grid is expanded to communities currently receiving electricity  from a mini-grid. Given the cheaper price of electricity from the grid, consumers  are liable to abandon the mini-grid, and the investor who owns the infrastructure  stands to lose money on the project.  Finally, as will become clear below, it should be remembered that operating a  mini-grid is essentially like operating a mini-utility and therefore requires  considerable economic, financial, and technical skill (Bhattacharyya & Palit,  2016). A lack of trained installers, technicians, and trainers therefore presents a  hurdle to their effective deployment in sub-Saharan Africa. Mini-grids also suffer  from the fact that they are a new technology and as such present a “risky  business environment due to unknown consumer characteristics and unfamiliar  business activities, weak institutional arrangements… [that arise]… from nonsupportive  regulatory and policy frameworks, limited access to low cost finance  and inadequacies in local skills and capacities” (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016, p.  167).  Mini-grid: Solutions  Because the principal barrier to mini-grids is the high tariffs that stem from the  high cost of capital (TERI-GNESD, 2014), reviews of experiences with mini-grids  have focused on how to keep the capital costs down. A number of potential  solutions exist, but they all come with their own challenges. Before talking about  such challenges, however, it should be noted that mini-grids stand to benefit  greatly from the advances in renewable technology, which will lower the cost of  both PV generation and storage (see Figure 5). Likewise, the arrival of new low-watt  appliances will mean that households can experience improved services  despite the high price of electricity from mini-grids. Considering opportunities for  mini-grids to address energy poverty therefore requires a serious consideration  of future prices for solar and storage technologies, which should be justified and  made explicit in any energy access policy.  35 Addressing energy poverty  Figure 5: The falling price of solar panels: March 2010–October 2016  Source: PVXchange, n.d.  Beyond technical advances, however, the most obvious solution to the problem  of high up-front costs is to cut corners on the size of the system by reducing its  capacity and storage or to purchase cheaper, low-quality system components.  However, reviews of experiments with mini-grids warn strongly against both  options, as both are likely to result in more rapid system failure and consumer  dissatisfaction. In the long run these outcomes will lead to higher costs and raise  the risk that the project will be abandoned altogether (M. Lee et al., 2014).  Instead, it is thought that investing in the longevity of the equipment and  minimizing replacement costs is the best way to keep costs down over the long  term (ARE, n.d.).  Without cutting corners in terms of size or quality, another way to hold down the  costs of a mini-grid system is to keep the system as small as possible while still  meeting people’s energy needs. Achieving this requires exhaustive analysis of  likely system demand prior to embarking on any project (ARE, n.d.; Deshmukh et  al., 2013). While this is certainly good advice, as well as a means to ensure that  demand-side management is built into any mini-grid system (Deshmukh et al.,  2013), it can be highly resource intensive. Unelectrified rural households rarely  know how much electricity they will use once they are connected. As a result,  demand analysis usually involves extensive assessments of household energy  use patterns. Mini-grid costs can potentially be lowered further by asking  households to sacrifice some reliability in return for lower tariffs (M. Lee et al.,  2014). Such a strategy, however, requires knowing not only exactly what demand  is likely to look like, but also how consumers will react to changes in reliability    and what an acceptable level of reliability would be.8 Understanding such  dynamics requires an even more detailed assessment of how users will consume  energy services—down to the hourly level—which is, again, very resource  intensive (M. Lee et al., 2014).  Another means of reducing the cost of electricity from mini-grids is to integrate  domestic and productive uses, limiting the latter to off-peak periods. Doing so will  distribute peak demand more evenly, allowing for more effective use of  generation capacity, which in turn, improves, cost recovery, and therefore allows  for lower overall tariffs (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016) (see Text Box 3). An  effective way to achieve this is to identify “anchor tenants”—relatively large  reliable consumers such as a cell tower or a mill—that can guarantee the  consumption of a basic amount of electricity during off-peak hours (ARE, n.d.;  Deshmukh et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2006; Palit & Sarangi, 2014). Residential and  small business users can then be added to the system, and the system can be  scaled up as demand increases. The use of an anchor tenant can also help  address the financing challenge, because private investors have the security of  selling a basic load of electricity to that tenant. Still, it can be challenging to  integrate productive and domestic loads as the former do not always easily arise  from electrification; the reasons for this are discussed in greater detail below.  Another means of reducing capital costs is to focus on hybrid systems in which  PV generation is augmented by a diesel genset —an electric generator powered  by a diesel engine (ARE, n.d.; Bhattacharyya, 2015; Murphy et al., 2014). The  genset can provide power to the system in cases of prolonged cloudiness and  also maintain the battery discharge at a minimum level, thereby increasing its  longevity (see Text Box 3). The system’s generation capacity does not have to  be oversized to the same extent, and battery packs can be smaller—two  advantages that save on up-front costs (Bhattacharyya, 2015). The integration of  PV and battery modules into existing diesel mini-grids can also effectively reduce  energy costs by cutting diesel consumption (Bhattacharyya, 2015; IRENA,  2016b; Murphy et al., 2014). The cost savings made possible by switching from  PV-only or diesel-only generation to hybrid systems get larger as the size of the  system increases (Bhattacharyya, 2015), and there is thought to be considerable  scope for such gains across sub-Saharan Africa given the scale of generator use  (see Figure 6) (IRENA, 2016b). Obviously, the possibilities for cost-savings  based on hybridization depend on the prices of diesel and PV components, but  for most prices in the near future, hybrid diesel-PV systems will provide the  lowest-cost electricity (Murphy et al., 2014) (see Figure 7).  8 If households use electricity for irrigation, for example, the loss of electricity for 12 hours three  times a year would not be a problem. If, however, electricity is used to provide refrigeration for  food stocks or vaccines, then outages of more than three hours become problematic.  37 Addressing energy poverty  Figure 6: The distribution of existing oil/diesel generator capacity in sub-  Saharan Africa    Yet hybrid diesel-PV systems also pose challenges. The introduction of diesel  results in carbon emissions9 and can cause electricity prices to become unstable  owing to fluctuations in the price of fuel.10 Diesel gensets also require  maintenance which has proven challenging in some contexts, and on top of this,  there are instances in which diesel supply chains are weak, rendering the PVhybrid  mini-grids vulnerable in cases where diesel cannot be procured (M. Lee et  al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2014). Given these challenges, expert advice has begun  to suggest eschewing hybrid systems in favor of purely PV generation, despite  the increased costs (M. Lee et al., 2014; Murphy et al., 2014).  9 In these systems PV generally ends up providing between 75 and 90 percent of the power (ARE,  n.d.), so carbon emissions and diesel price impacts are relatively small.  10 See footnote 4.   Figure 7: Price points at which PV-only, hybrid, and diesel-only mini-grids  produce the lowest-cost electricity  Source: Murphy et al., 2014, p. 533.  Proper battery management is essential to the longevity of mini-grids. While  management can be automated (ARE, n.d.), having skilled technicians to  manage the mini-grid can reduce overall system costs. Technicians can make  appropriate decisions about balancing battery life with system reliability in cases  of reduced generation or in times of heavy load (M. Lee et al., 2014). Sub-  Saharan Africa, however, currently lacks skilled technicians (Bhattacharyya,  2012). In addition, introducing discretion on the part of technician can open the  door for battery mismanagement (see Text Box 3), which can end up increasing  overall energy costs and threaten the sustainability of the system (ARE, n.d.).  Such problems have been observed in Bangladesh, where batteries have been  observed to last as little as 4–5 years (TERI-GNESD, 2014) when their expected  life should be closer to 10 years (Bhattacharyya, 2015).  In principle it would be possible to lower the cost of electricity from mini-grids by  using grid-connected consumers to subsidize the expansion of distributed  electricity infrastructure just as one would subsidize grid expansion (dividing the  cost of any expansion by all the existing grid-connected customers) (Deshmukh  et al., 2013). This analogy does not hold perfectly in the case of mini-grids,  however. All grid users benefit from a more diverse pool of consumers (so long  as there is sufficient generation capacity), but connecting households to an  isolated mini-grid does not diversify the national grid. Subsidies could still be  justified on social justice grounds, but in practice such an approach raises  questions about whether existing consumers should subsidize private purveyors  of mini-grids or only state-owned mini-grids that will eventually be incorporated  39 Addressing energy poverty  into the grid. The complexities of such an arrangement appear to have prevented  it from being implemented anywhere (Deshmukh et al., 2013; TERI-GNESD,  2014).  The final means for keeping tariffs down is to ensure that the equipment used in  the mini-grid is used for the full extent of its lifespan. Given that the longest-lasting  components in a mini-grid can last for 25 years, ensuring that mini-grids  operate for the full 25 years is an effective means for keeping tariffs as low as  possible because no component value is wasted (ARE, n.d.). This solution,  however, compounds problems of grid encroachment, which dissuades private  investment in distributed energy systems with long payback periods.  Challenges related to grid encroachment can however be mitigated. Mini-grids  can be designed to be incorporated into the grid when it arrives. Under such a  scenario, generation capacity as well as distribution infrastructure could be  bought by the utility and then integrated into the overall grid (ARE, n.d.;  Deshmukh et al., 2013). Similarly, the utility could purchase electricity from the  owner of the mini-grid at a set price until the costs of the system have been fully  recovered. In both cases, however, the utility will likely be subsidizing the private  seller, who will be forced to sell electricity at a higher price than that available  from the grid. In addition, designing mini-grids so they can be incorporated into  the grid imposes higher up-front costs during construction. These mainly involve  ensuring that the system can deliver three-phase power (ARE, n.d.) (see Text  Box 3) by adding inverters (which require maintenance and are expensive to  replace) to PV systems in order to convert the DC produced by solar panels to  AC. Another potential solution to grid encroachment is to keep mini-grid systems  separated from the grid after it arrives (a process known as “islanding”). Such an  approach can be used to ensure cost recovery on investments in mini-grids  (Deshmukh et al., 2013), but it can also create political challenges if populations  that could connect to the grid are stuck paying higher tariffs for a potentially  inferior service, as they could be on the mini-grid.  Addressing issues of (1) financing, (2) lack of technical staff to support mini-grid  operation and maintenance, and (3) challenges associated with first-generation  technologies will likely require heavy support from donors and the state. Such  support would include the development of tools for financing local entrepreneurs  in this space; training for the array of personnel involved in mini-grid siting,  installation, operation, and maintenance; and support for data sharing and  learning around the creation of effective business models (Alstone et al., 2015;  ARE, n.d.; Deshmukh et al., 2013).  While there is certainly scope for the private sector to deliver mini-grids, the idea  that the private sector will simply fill the vacuum left by the failure of the state and  exploit the untapped market among unelectrified households in sub-Saharan  Africa appears naïve. In this respect all assessments of mini-grid success and   failure point to the need for a strong regulatory and policy environment in order  for the private sector to operate effectively (Alstone et al., 2015; ARE, n.d.;  Deshmukh et al., 2013; IRENA, 2016a; Palit & Sarangi, 2014; TERI-GNESD,  2014). While there are no silver-bullet solutions to the policy and regulatory  challenges surrounding mini-grids, a number of generic actions to be taken have  been identified. The state should (1) ensure that subsidies are available to make  mini-grids economically viable (see below), (2) develop a regulatory environment  that lays out the rules of the game for different actors, (3) take the lead in at least  providing resource surveys, (4) make public all plans for grid expansion, (5)  ensure the safety and reliability of the mini-grid and make allowances for  islanding or integration of the mini-grid when the national grid arrives, and (6)  provide training in design, siting, operation, and maintenance of mini-grids  (Deshmukh et al., 2013).  The state or utility can also play an important function in bundling mini-grid  projects together so that they start to make financial sense for the private sector  (ARE, n.d.). This is often achieved on the basis of geographic concessions,  offered via tenders, in which companies take responsibility for supplying mini-grid  systems to all the potential users in a geographic area (Mostert, 2008).  It should be noted, however, that even under supportive conditions the private  sector has been known to refuse to deliver mini-grids to certain areas if they are  considered too remote, too poor, or too small to offer serious potential for growth  in demand (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016). In this respect, even though distributed  energy technologies are intended to improve energy access among the poor,  reviews show that they continue to benefit the relatively well-off (Bhattacharyya &  Palit, 2016; World Bank, 2008). Community-managed mini-grids could help  address this challenge, but any community-driven development effort takes a  great deal of time and resources and therefore does not scale quickly or easily  (ARE, n.d.).  Overall, mini-grids provide a potentially valuable way to deliver electricity to areas  for which grid access will be a challenge. Even though the up-front costs are less  than those for grid extension, they still pose significant challenges for financing  projects and result in high costs of electricity. There are ways to get around these  challenges, but they all involve creating bespoke energy systems in which  demand patterns are analyzed exhaustively and systems are built to purpose.  The extent to which such systems are context specific and reliant on new  technology poses major challenges to their scalability and creates a significant  technical burden. At the moment mini-grids in Africa are focused on pilot efforts,  and to be a source of mass electrification they will need to be scaled up  significantly and quickly. Studies examining the challenges to scaling up  distributed energy systems in South Asia have identified problems similar to  those that dominate the sub-Saharan African context: small markets, lack of  financing, uncertain policy environments, and a lack of business models for  41 Addressing energy poverty  managing and maintaining a huge amount of distributed infrastructure  (Bhattacharyya, 2014).  SOLAR HOME SYSTEMS (SHSs)  Smaller than mini-grids, solar home systems are generation systems designed to  provide electricity to a single household using solar panels and a small battery.  While SHSs can be large, including many solar panels and a large battery, for  the purpose of increasing energy access among low-income groups such  systems usually include only a couple of panels and a small battery, providing  very limited amounts of power. The major advantage of SHSs is that they can be  used to provide electricity to isolated households (in contrast to the mini-grid,  which requires that households be clustered together so they can all be  connected to the generating source via a low-voltage distribution line11). Because  utilities traditionally lack expertise in retail, they often leave the provision of such  systems to the private sector, through either direct sales or concessions (Mostert,  2008).  Challenges with SHSs  The downside of SHSs is that due to the small size of these systems they can  only provide small amounts of electricity (suitable for lighting, entertainment,  charging a cell phone, and cooling) that are available for only a limited number of  hours a day. These systems are unable to supply energy for heating or cooking  and are not sufficient to provide motive power to support small industry. As such,  the technology provides only the lowest tiers of energy access. Like mini-grids,  SHSs stand to gain from likely future advances that reduce the cost of renewable  generation and storage components and from the arrival of new low-watt  appliances on the market.  Theft of solar panels can be a problem. Where this is the case households have  been known to surround panels with locked steel cages or remove panels from  their roofs so they can better watch them, and then lock them indoors while  households are unattended. In all instances changing the installation of the solar  panels decreases their generation capacity,12 compromising the capacity of the  system even further (Azimoh et al., 2014).  11 SHSs have sometimes been set up in nano-grids to allow for better sharing of batteries and  capacity.  12 Solar panels are usually placed on unshaded roofs facing the equator at an angle that maximizes  their exposure to incoming solar radiation (“insolation”). Moving panels so that they no longer  face the equator or stand without and angle or covering them (e.g., with cages) all serve to  reduce the insolation they receive and therefore reduce system capacity.   The low capacity of the SHSs not only limits potential development impacts, but  can also cause problems for sustainability. As a household slowly purchases  appliances, it increases the load on the system (Gustavsson, 2007; K. Lee et al.,  2016). If a household overloads the system, placing extra strain on the battery, it  shortens battery life and increases the cost of the overall system (see Text Box  3) (Ellegård et al., 2004).  SHSs also raise regulatory challenges. In South Africa, for example, some local  technicians have been involved in a black-market service in which they offer to  bypass load control units on batteries (see below under “SHS: Solutions”).  Likewise, battery mismanagement, and the associated costs, has put subsidies  under pressure. Eventually this has resulted in nonpayment to the companies  responsible for the concessions, causing them to drop out of the program  (Azimoh et al., 2014). In Bangladesh there have been reports of problems  caused by the use of low-quality components, poor installation practices, and  inadequate control mechanisms, all of which compromise long-term sustainability  (Bhattacharyya, 2015).  Finally, SHSs are truly unable to take advantage of economies of scale. While  they are the cheapest way to deliver electricity to isolated and remote  households, the electricity from an SHS is usually more expensive than that  provided by a mini-grid that provides the same level of services (Bhattacharyya,  2015) (see Text Box 4). In addition, even with relatively low capital costs, many  poor households remain unable to afford the up-front costs of SHS installation.  SHS: Solutions  As with the mini-grid, problems related to the affordability of both the system and  the electricity it produces can be addressed by providing subsidies (as in South  Africa13) (Azimoh et al., 2015) or creating accessible credit schemes (such as the  Grameen Shakti program in Bangladesh).  To help improve battery management and prevent excessive discharging, load  control systems can be added to the system. It should be noted, however, that  there are documented cases of such systems’ being circumvented and batteries’  being discharged anyway (Azimoh et al., 2014). Risk of theft can be reduced by  using mobile racks that hold the solar panels off the ground and at an appropriate  angle,14 yet allow households to move them inside when the dwelling is  unattended (Azimoh et al., 2014).  It is thought that many of the challenges with SHSs can be addressed if the  communities receiving the technology are suitably well engaged so that they  understand the capacity of the system and the challenges to sustainability posed  by system mismanagement. Yet it can be difficult to manage people’s  expectations when they have a desire for higher-capacity systems (Benjamin,  2015; Lee et al., 2016), especially when the populations being served by SHSs  are interacting with consumers who are served by mini-grids or the national grid,  who pay less for their electricity, and who receive a higher-quality service  (Azimoh et al., 2014; Mostert, 2008). As with mini-grids, households sometimes  abandon SHSs when the grid arrives in their area (Khandker et al., 2009b).  Finally, as with mini-grids, the rollout of SHSs will require an active role for the  state or utility, which will, at least, have to create the appropriate conditions for  the delivery of such services. These conditions will include an appropriate  regulatory environment that ensures the quality of the systems being installed  and engages project recipients in understanding the need to manage the service  appropriately and the challenges related to system capacity. As with mini-grids,  bundling households into concessions is an effective tool for making their  installation profitable to the private sector. Finally, issues of grid encroachment  will remain a challenge. The utility must not only make transparent statements  about grid expansion plans (and remain true to these), but also have a policy in  place for managing how distributed technologies will interact with the grid when it  arrives.  Overall SHSs provide an important means for providing access to electricity, but  the general success or failure of a program depends on the specific context. In  many cases households have been satisfied with the service they receive from  SHSs despite the costs (Ellegård et al., 2004). In general satisfaction results of  the fact that using liquid fuels for illumination (candles or kerosene) is so  inefficient (Mills, 2003) that SHS can still prove a cheaper way for households to  meet their illumination needs. Furthermore, because illumination from an electric  bulb is preferred to illumination from a candle and solid fuels cannot provide  cooling, entertainment, or ICT services. As a result households have even been  willing to pay more for electricity from SHSs than they would normally spend on  kerosene and candles (Ellegård et al., 2004). In other cases, however, the limited  capacity of SHSs has resulted in high levels of dissatisfaction, especially if  recipients live near consumers who receive electricity from the grid (Azimoh et  al., 2015; Schillebeeck et al., 2012). Studies have shown that people can have a  sense of isolation or discrimination when they receive inferior electricity services  as a result of their access being limited to distributed technologies  (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016). In some cases households have resisted being  connected via SHSs in order to avoid being marked as “connected” and  undermining their chances of gaining access to the grid at a later date (Ellegård  et al., 2004). Provision of SHSs should thus not be viewed as a substitute for grid  connections; rather, SHS technology must be incorporated into a broader  process of connecting households to larger energy systems.   SOLAR APPLIANCES  Solar appliances refer to individual appliances (torches, radios, cell-phone  chargers, lanterns) that run on solar power and provide energy services. The  major advantage of such appliances is that they have very low capital  requirements, have supply chains that can be established relatively easily, and  offer a big market for the private sector. There is evidence that such appliances  are having rapid and significant impacts on domestic energy systems, replacing  dry-cell batteries as well as solid and liquid fuels for illumination purposes  (Turman-Bryant et al., 2015). In two Kenyan towns, for example, the number of  off-grid lighting products rose by 77 percent between 2012 and 2014, with sales  from such products more than quadrupling, from $32,000 to $180,000, over the  same period (Turman-Bryant et al., 2015).  Challenges with solar appliances  The principal challenge for solar appliances is that they provide only small  quantities of electricity and have limited storage capabilities. As such, they are  only useful for meeting the lowest tiers of energy access and do not supply  motive power to support livelihood diversification or help meet thermal energy  service needs. In addition, because they are a new technology, uptake can be  slow. Such appliances have relatively low capital costs, but compared with  household incomes, they may still be considered expensive.  Solar appliances: Solutions  Little can be done about the limited capacity of such devices, but as with minigrids  and SHSs, future gains are possible from the development of low-watt  appliances and cheaper solar components. To improve uptake, it is thought that  providing guarantees of the quality of the devices, as well as socializing their  advantages over solid fuels, can increase households’ willingness to spend  relatively large sums of money on untested technologies (Turman-Bryant et al.,  2015).  Overall, under the right conditions, it appears that solar appliances can play an  important role in providing people with the lowest tiers of energy access. Their  rapid success in transforming the energy system in certain contexts suggests  that solar-powered devices are considered significantly superior to solid and  liquid fuels when it comes to illumination and that ICTs (which can only be  powered by electricity) are highly valued. Efforts thus need to be focused on  promoting these technologies and then incorporating them into a process that  delivers energy systems capable of more completely meeting people’s energy  needs.    4. ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY  POVERTY  Before discussing the empirical work on the impact of electrification on energy-poor  households, it is worth pointing out that there are significant experimental  challenges when it comes to testing this relationship. When areas receive  electricity (especially grid electricity), they also tend to be undergoing other  changes, such as significant economic and/or population growth, which means  that they are also likely to be experiencing other changes in terms of resourcing  and infrastructure. As a result, it is difficult to disentangle the impacts of  electrification on development from the effects of other processes taking place in  a population (Burlig & Preonas, 2016; Dinkelman, 2011; Khandker et al., 2009a).  To resolve these challenges, researchers have used a host of novel and  sophisticated methods.15 It is worth keeping in mind, however, that “in the end it  must be admitted that all cross-sectional analysis have their shortcomings, and  … [that] … impacts [of electrification] may be short-term. [In short:] The patterns  observed today may not hold in the future” (Khandker et al., 2009, p. 22).  Nonetheless, multiple works on electrification show a few recurrent features  regarding their impacts on household energy poverty, economic development,  and services.  IMPACTS ON HOUSEHOLD ENERGY POVERTY  When people receive access to electricity in their home, they principally use it for  lighting, entertainment and ICTs, and cooling. The results are increased use of  appliances, reduced candle and kerosene use, increased access to lighting, and  less time spent collecting fuels (Azimoh et al., 2015; Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016;  Broto et al., 2015; Dinkelman, 2011; Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  Beyond this, while access to electricity changes household fuel choices and  reduces the use of some solid fuels (Dinkelman, 2011), it generally does not  cause households to shift away from using predominantly solid fuels for cooking  and heating16 (Bailis et al., 2005; Broto et al., 2015; Gebreegziabher et al., 2012;  15 These methods include panel data, control groups (Khandker et al., 2009b), instrumental  variables (Dinkelman, 2011; Khandker et al., 2009a), regression discontinuity (Burlig &  Preonas, 2016), propensity score matching (Khandker et al., 2009a), and simple qualitative  impact assessments.  16 There are some minor exceptions to this finding around the use of electric rice cookers in Asia  (World Bank, 2008).   Khandker et al., 2009b; Madubansi & Shackleton, 2006; Malla & Timilsina, 2014;  Masera et al., 2000; Prasad & Visagie, 2006; World Bank, 2008). This overall  pattern persists even when electrification rates are high (Bailis et al., 2005; Broto  et al., 2015) and long after electricity access has been established (Bailis et al.,  2005; Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005; World Bank, 2008). The relationship holds  among very wealthy households (Hiemstra-Van der Horst & Hovorka, 2008;  Khandker et al., 2010), including those in the 90th income percentile17 (Bacon et  al., 2010). It holds when access to fuelwood decreases (Madubansi &  Shackleton, 2006) and when electricity is the cheapest available fuel source  (Hosier & Kipondya, 1993). And the pattern largely holds across rural and urban  areas (Broto et al., 2015), though urban areas have seen greater use of  electricity for cooking (Bacon et al., 2010; Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005).  Despite the failure to transition energy-poor households toward using electricity  for cooking and heating, electrification has a significant impact on people’s wellbeing.  For example, the illumination provided by SHSs in South Africa was found  to be used effectively to improve safety and scare away reptiles from people’s  dwellings. Access to entertainment has also been noted to improve people’s  quality of life (Azimoh et al., 2015; Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Finally, electrification  was found to have positive impacts on education by increasing study hours  (Azimoh et al., 2015; Khandker et al., 2009a; Prasad & Visagie, 2006) and school  enrollment rates (Khandker et al., 2009b). However, caution about simple  emphatic claims of the positive impact of electricity on education may be  warranted. A study involving 30,000 Indian villages, for example, showed no  evidence of increased school enrollment as a result of households’ being  provided with access to electricity through the grid (Burlig & Preonas, 2016).  The value of electricity to recently connected households is also evidenced by  the fact that newly connected areas are repeatedly found to experience a  subsequent increase in demand. This is thought to be due to households’ slowly  purchasing appliances that they have had to save up for (Khandker et al.,  2009b). This increase in demand also occurs after households get connected to  mini-grid projects (ARE, n.d.; Burlig & Preonas, 2016). The impact of appliance  purchases is compounded when households that were initially skeptical of the  project subsequently want to be connected after they witness the benefits  experienced by connected households. In fact, this trend is so common that it is  considered good practice to oversize mini-grid installations in order to cope with  the subsequent increases in demand that are likely to take place (ARE, n.d.). If  revealed preferences are an indicator of welfare maximization, then such  increases in demand speak to a robust trend whereby households gain  substantially from accessing electricity.  17 This percentile was measured as household earnings as much as $800 a month (2005,  purchasing power parity) (Bacon et al., 2010).  47 Addressing energy poverty  IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  While the evidence on the impact of electrification on household energy poverty  is clear, the evidence on the economic impacts of electrification is much more  ambiguous (Cook, 2011). Although the literature tends to agree that access to  electricity in rural areas does not drive industrialization (Dinkelman, 2011;  Khandker et al., 2009b; World Bank, 2008), the findings on the impacts on small  business development, livelihood diversification, and household incomes are  mixed. Reviews of the impacts of both grid connections and distributed energy  find no particularly noticeable impacts on economic development, which are  generally thought to be uncertain and largely anecdotal (Schillebeeck et al.,  2012; Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2014). Yet there are single studies that find  systematic and generalizable impacts, showing that electrification drives  increases in income and improvements in economic activity. These mixed results  suggest that while electrification matters for economic development, by itself it is  insufficient to drive development, and other factors likely matter in determining  economic outcomes (Cook, 2011).  Reviews find that only a few households use electricity for productive purposes  (World Bank, 2008). Among those that do, the focus is on a few small business  owners who use electric lighting to extend their business hours (Azimoh et al.,  2015; Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Broto et al., 2015) or the small number of  households that use electricity to start new businesses, such as hairdressing  salons (Broto et al., 2015; K. Lee et al., 2014) and cold storage facilities (Broto et  al., 2015). In particular, electrification has been shown to favor the creation of  sectors that provide electronic services (such as showing TV, charging phones,  and playing music). Notably, there is limited evidence of households using  electricity for productive purposes involving motive power (such as carpentry or  milling) (Khandker et al., 2009b; K. Lee et al., 2014).  The limited effects of electrification on economic development have been  observed in both rural and urban contexts. A study of 30,000 Indian villages  electrified under the Prime Minister’s Rural Electrification Program,18 for example,  found that, at best, electrification leads to only small changes in economic  outcomes in the medium term (three to five years) (Burlig & Preonas, 2016). The  pattern persists in urban areas: in Cape Town’s informal settlements, for  example, electrification was found to have almost no discernable impact on  economic activity (Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005).  On the other hand, studies showing strong generalizable links between access to  household energy and the creation of informal sector enterprises point out how  women’s income opportunities have been observed to increase in urban areas as  a result of access to electricity. Women use it to support commercial activities  such as dressmaking, washing, ironing, and hairdressing (Clancy, 2006). The  rollout of the grid in the KwaZulu Natal Province, in South Africa, was found to  drive an increase in employment, with female employment found to rise  significantly. Not only did electrification increase the number of jobs in rural  KwaZulu Natal, but it also increased the hours women worked, with most of this  work thought to come through the creation of cottage industries (Dinkelman,  2011). Large-scale studies on the impact of grid rollout in Bangladesh and  Vietnam found that access to electricity increased household incomes from both  on-farm and off-farm sources. In Vietnam the gains were greatest among on-farm  sources because electricity was used for irrigation (Khandker et al., 2009a;  Khandker et al., 2009b).  Increases in household incomes as a result of increasing energy access appear  to happen slowly at first, rising over time before they plateau. Again, the slow  increase is thought to be due to the time it takes households to be able to  purchase appliances necessary to take advantage of electricity to provide  services (Khandker et al., 2009a; Khandker et al., 2009b).  IMPACTS ON SERVICES  Little research has looked explicitly at the impact of electrification on the  availability and quality of services (Practical Action, 2014). That said, research on  the impacts of electrification in Maputo showed that people found the provision of  street lighting to be important for safety, for making it easier to run errands after  dark in the winding walkways of an informal settlement, and for creating a  welcoming neighborhood (Broto et al., 2015). Although expanding access to  electricity has been used to improve the cold chain (which is important for  vaccines) questions have been raised about whether this translates into  increases in immunization rates (World Bank, 2008). The largest impacts of  electricity on service provision are thought to result from a greater willingness on  the part of health and education workers to remain in rural areas once they are  electrified (World Bank, 2008).  Although energy is necessary for a host of services that can have profound  impacts on human well-being, simply providing electricity, whether from the grid  or from distributed sources, does not guarantee that people will start consuming  those energy services. In general, newly electrified households tend to use  electricity for lighting, communications, entertainment, and cooling. They do not,  for the most part, use electricity for cooking or heating. In terms of the economic  impacts of electricity access, the results are decidedly mixed. Many studies  indicate that economic impacts are small and limited to a few individuals, with the  deployment of electricity for motive power being extremely limited. At the same  time, other studies point to large, generalizable positive effects on income  49 Addressing energy poverty  through improved access to irrigation and the creation of cottage industries.  Predictions that rural electrification would lead to large-scale improvements in  well-being among poor populations in low-income countries, fueled by a huge  diversity of small-scale industries, do not appear to have been borne out in the  empirical literature to date. In terms of services while the evidence base is limited  access to electricity does appear to have improved access to services.  While the benefits to income and well-being that result from access to electricity  should not be overlooked, users’ failure to use electricity for thermal services,  and ambiguous findings on the economic impacts, present real challenges to  efforts at addressing energy poverty. In developing countries, cooking and  heating consume more household energy than any other activity—as much as 90  percent (Bhattacharyya, 2012; Malla & Timilsina, 2014)—and using solid fuels for  these activities drives the most severe negative health outcomes (Africa  Progress Panel, 2015). The limited use of electricity for productive purposes not  only suggests a failed opportunity to stimulate development gains, but also  strains the financing of energy projects. This is because exclusive domestic  energy use causes peak loads to concentrate in the early evening, increasing the  cost of the overall system (see Text Box 3) (World Bank, 2008). In addition, the  failure to increase household incomes threatens the long-term sustainability of  electricity access efforts because poor populations remain unable to afford the  tariffs that are required to cover the full costs of generating the electricity  (Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2014) (see section on tariffs and subsidies below for  details).  As a result, efforts to address energy poverty need to go well beyond simply  providing access to electricity. They need to account for the persistent use of  solid fuels for meeting people’s thermal needs, and they need to integrate better  with the factors driving economic development.   5. BEYOND ELECTRICITY:  THINKING MORE BROADLY  ABOUT ENERGY ACCESS  In addition to improving access to electricity, any serious effort to address energy  poverty will need to pay greater attention to questions of energy for cooking and  heating. To understand why efforts at electrification have failed to address  household energy poverty, it is useful to begin by discussing the paradigm that  informed the strong focus on electricity.  UNDERSTANDING FUEL CHOICES  The hope that access to electricity would address household energy poverty  stems from a particular conception of how households make choices about fuels,  known as the “energy ladder” (Agbemabiese et al., 2012; Hiemstra-Van der Horst  & Hovorka, 2008; Masera et al., 2000). Under this conception, households are  expected to purchase the most sophisticated fuel they can afford based on what  is available to them. Households are expected to choose less-polluting, more  efficient fuels, so that they substitute dung for wood, wood for charcoal, charcoal  for kerosene, and kerosene for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) or electricity—with  each fuel representing a higher, rung on the energy ladder. In this model, wood is  the fuel of the poor, and people’s fuel choices are determined by constraints  related to access to fuels and low incomes (Hiemstra-Van der Horst & Hovorka,  2008). Thus the focus on electricity has been based on the assumption that  households have a natural preference for electricity and will use it based on the  savings to be had from using a more efficient, less locally polluting fuel. However,  the energy ladder has been criticized for ignoring human agency in fuel choices  and for doing a poor job at predicting them (Hiemstra-Van der Horst & Hovorka,  2008).  Subsequent empirical studies looking at fuel use have suggested that a more  effective conceptualization of fuel choices is the idea of “fuel stacking” (Bacon et  al., 2010; Hiemstra-Van der Horst & Hovorka, 2008; Masera et al., 2000). In this  conception, rather than simply exchanging traditional fuels for modern ones,  households make deliberate choices to use specific fuels to meet particular  needs (Hiemstra-Van der Horst & Hovorka, 2008; Madubansi & Shackleton,  2006). Choices regarding which fuels to keep in the household and when to use  them are based on assessments of both needs and opportunities, which are  51 Addressing energy poverty  located in complex household energy economies. Relevant considerations  include the availability and price of different fuels, cultural preferences for using  certain cooking methods, and the opportunity cost of acquiring those fuels  considering the resources available to the household (Bacon et al., 2010;  Gebreegziabher et al., 2012; Khandker et al., 2010; Khandker et al., 2009b;  Malla & Timilsina, 2014; Meikle & Bannister, 2003).  Fuel stacking accounts for the complex fuel choices that households have been  observed to make. Within this framework, the persistent use of solid fuels for  cooking and heating, even when electricity and LPG are available, is explained  by the fact that collected fuelwood has no monetary cost and because  household-labor is often abundant. Charcoal, which must be purchased, has the  advantage of being available in small quantities that match households’ limited  access to cash (Bacon et al., 2010). In contrast, LPG must be bought in a large  canister (a problem referred to as “lumpiness”19 in the literature), and many  households are unable to afford it at any one point in time (Cowan &  Mohlakoana, 2005). Finally, in addition to concerns around reliability mentioned  earlier, households continue to use solid fuels because of cultural preferences  regarding how different fuels affect the flavor of food and because the individuals  preparing food know how to use them. In this respect households have been  observed making highly strategic choices about using different fuels for different  foods—for example, making “modern foods” such as tea, coffee, and macaroni  on an electric hotplate while using fuelwood to prepare traditional foods that  require long simmering times (and that are also vulnerable blackouts if prepared  on an unreliable grid) (Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005; Hiemstra-Van der Horst &  Hovorka, 2008).  Research on the complex energy economies apparent within households has  also found that households will maintain fuels such as kerosene and candles in  the home for illumination even when they have access to electricity (K. Lee et al.,  2016). The reason for this is that the grid is liable to suffer blackouts, and  SHS/mini-grid connections may not provide sufficient energy to cover illumination  needs for the whole household.  Overall, work on fuel choices has observed that although introducing modern  fuels into households drives changes in how households access energy services  (such as reducing the kerosene used for lighting), it does not lead to the  complete substitution of those fuels. Instead, when households gain access to  modern fuels, they tend to further diversify the array of fuels they use, adding  electricity and/or LPG to the mix (Madubansi & Shackleton, 2006; Masera et al.,  2000).  19 The issue of cash flow and fuel choice is addressed in the economic literature through the  concept of “lumpiness.” Lumpy items are those that cannot be bought in continuous or small  quantities, but which instead must be purchased in some large discrete quantity. If a fuel is  lumpy, it means that a household must have money on hand to afford it. For example, a large  LPG cylinder is lumpy because a household has to have enough cash on hand to pay for a fuel  supply that will serve them well into the future. Charcoal, however, can be purchased in small  quantities sufficient for a day’s worth of cooking. Given cash-flow constraints in energy-poor  households, the lumpiness of a fuel is thought to be an important consideration for access. As  such, it is suggested that modern fuels can be promoted if their supply chains allow for them to  be bought in small quantities that match household cash-flow dynamics.   Despite the abundant literature criticizing the concept of the energy ladder, the  ladder metaphor is invoked in contemporary discussions about energy access. In  contemporary conceptions however rungs of the energy ladder refer to the extent  to which households use modern fuels to access an increasing number of energy  services – essentially conflating the notion of a ladder rung, with tiers of energy  access. The first rung of the ladder, for example, is the use of electricity for  lighting, communications, and entertainment (see, e.g., Lee et al., 2016; Africa  Progress Panel, 2015). This new usage still focuses on the idea that people will  increasingly move toward using modern fuels to meet more of their energy  service needs and that their failure to do so is driven primarily by constraints on  their ability to choose their fuels. This conception still generally fails to account  for the agency of households in choosing fuels (Hiemstra-Van der Horst &  Hovorka, 2008). Problems of the energy ladder aside, it should be pointed out  that the fuel-stacking model, despite its advantages, fails to effectively explain  why and when households begin to abandon solid biomass fuels and use  modern fuels to meet all of their energy service needs.  The limitations of these respective models of fuel choice aside, both models have  focused heavily on the potential role of fuel price and income as constraints on  fuel choice. As such these two factors have received particular attention in the  literature.  THE IMPACT OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND FUEL  PRICE ON FUEL CHOICES  Within household energy economies, the impact of household income and fuel  price on fuel choices is particularly complex. On the one hand, income has been  shown not to determine household fuel choices (see above). On the other hand,  household income is repeatedly identified as one of the few factors that is reliably  associated with the likelihood that households will use more modern fuels (Lewis  & Pattanayak, 2012; Malla & Timilsina, 2014). Likewise, while fuel price has been  shown not to determine fuel choices, increases in the price of a particular fuel  have, in certain cases, been observed to cause households to revert to using  less desirable fuels (Malla & Timilsina, 2014; Meikle & Bannister, 2003). In other  cases, households respond to price increases by simply decreasing their energy  consumption and using less of that fuel or by minimizing other household  expenses to free up income to spend on the more expensive fuel (Meikle &  53 Addressing energy poverty  Bannister, 2003). Any fuel substitutions are likewise context specific and play out  in terms of the complex array of factors shaping the household energy economy.  One outcome of the complex relationship between fuel price, household income  and fuel choices is that research has noted how increased access to electricity  can have highly varied outcomes across different income groups. For example,  within groups that are all classified as monetarily poor, the wealthiest individuals  have been observed to make increasing use of modern fuels for thermal needs  (even though solid fuels remain the dominant source for thermal energy needs).  Among the poorest individuals, however, access to electricity has been shown to  drive no changes at all in the way people meet their thermal energy needs  (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Such outcomes mirror findings showing that  electrification projects tend to primarily drive improvements in economic  outcomes among the wealthy and that access to electricity tends to benefit the  most well-off households while resulting in few to no economic impacts among  the poor (Bhattacharyya, 2012; World Bank, 2008).  The fact that solid fuels continue to dominate household energy use, however,  means that even with the provision of electricity, households are still exposed to  the myriad challenges involved with using those fuels (Cowan & Mohlakoana,  2005). Pollutants generated while cooking remain, as do the other the dangers  (e.g., burns) and the drudgery associated with collecting fuelwood and long  cooking times. Although exposure to particulates from burning kerosene might be  diminished as a result of the switch to electric lighting, the fact that households  still keep kerosene means that the risk of poisoning persists (Cowan &  Mohlakoana, 2005; K. Lee et al., 2014). Finally, given the persistence of candles  and kerosene, dangers of fire remain (though they may be diminished by their  decreased use) (Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005). As such there is a clear need to  consider a broader set of approaches to addressing energy poverty than simply  focusing on access to electricity.  THE ROLE FOR IMPROVED COOKSTOVES  Given the problems associated with the persistent use of solid biomass for  cooking, it is clear why promoting “clean” or “improved cookstoves” (hereafter  “improved cookstoves”) is an important complementary approach to  electrification. Although there is currently no formal definition of an improved  cookstove, it generally refers to any stove that cooks more efficiently than the  traditional three-stone stove (Practical Action, 2014).  The potential impacts of improved cookstoves range from a simple reduction in  indoor air pollution as a result of improved combustion rates to the virtual  elimination of pollutants in stoves that incorporate forced ventilation. Beyond  reducing pollution, improved cookstoves also reduce cooking times and fuel   requirements. Together the result is improved health outcomes, less time  collecting fuel, savings from reduced purchase of fuel, and less environmental  stress on stores of fuelwood (Lewis & Pattanayak, 2012).  While the designs of improved charcoal-burning cookstoves are well established,  fuelwood cookstoves are still a challenge as they must be specifically designed  to handle local fuels, which can vary by moisture content, size of the logs, and  the density of wood (Modi et al., 2006).  Although efforts to promote improved cookstoves have been ongoing since the  1980s (Agbemabiese et al., 2012; Bhattacharyya, 2012), rates of adoption have  been frustratingly slow (Bhattacharyya, 2012; Malla & Timilsina, 2014). As of  2009, for example, only 4 percent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa had  access to improved cookstoves (WHO-UNDP, 2009). Part of the problem is that,  with the heavy focus on electrification, clean cookstoves have received relatively  little policy attention (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016). More recently, the issue of  clean cookstoves has gained greater traction at an international level with the  creation of the Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, which plans to foster the adoption  of clean cookstoves and fuels in 100 million households by 2020 (Bhattacharyya,  2012; Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, n.d.).  Questions about the barriers to, and determinants of, clean cookstove adoption  have spawned an extensive literature. Several factors have consistently been  found to show a positive association with the use of improved cookstoves:  degree of urbanization, household income, and education and awareness  (Gebreegziabher et al., 2012; Lewis & Pattanayak, 2012; Malla & Timilsina,  2014). The relevance of education and awareness has been found to vary  depending on who is educated—it is women and the household head whose  education drive increased use of improved cookstoves (Lewis & Pattanayak,  2012; Malla & Timilsina, 2014).  Findings from the literature on the adoption of improved cookstoves tend to  mirror the findings on the adoption of improved fuels, and lessons from the  discussion on the energy ladder are relevant. The factors listed above should be  seen as associated with improved cookstove adoption rather than determining it.  Like fuel choices, improved cookstove adoption needs to be understood within  the larger social context in which households make complex decisions regarding  the suitability of different technologies (Lewis & Pattanayak, 2012). This context  includes, for example, cultural preferences about cooking and the suitability of  stove technologies in relation to cultural norms (Agbemabiese et al., 2012; Broto  et al., 2015; Malla & Timilsina, 2014). Finally, evidence on the importance of  female education in fuel choices suggests that previous explanations regarding  the persistence of solid biomass for cooking based on its low monetary cost  might actually be determined by the opportunity cost of women’s time, with that  cost increasing when women are educated (Madubansi & Shackleton, 2006).  LIQUID PETROLEUM GAS (LPG)  Beyond policies promoting improved cookstoves, the other dominant solution to  persistent energy poverty has been promoting the use of LPG. While such  policies have had some success, for example in India, challenges remain around  efforts to make LPG a common household fuel among the poor. Such challenges  include weak supply chains (Bacon et al., 2010; Clancy, 2006), especially in rural  areas, and the “lumpiness” of the fuel20 (which can be exacerbated by supply  chain problems if households have to purchase backup canisters) (Bacon et al.,  2010). In addition, qualitative studies have revealed that people have concerns  about the safety of LPG, fearing that the canisters are liable to explode  (Madubansi & Shackleton, 2006). As with electricity, adoption of LPG is hindered  by the fact that people must purchase appliances in order to cook with it or use it  for heating (Bhattacharyya, 2012). As a result, LPG use faces many of the same  barriers as the use of improved cookstoves. Finally, some authors have identified  cultural barriers to the use of LPG, reporting that people complain that food  tastes different when prepared using LPG (Clancy, 2008).  Text Box 5: Biodigesters  Along with distributed renewable electricity generation technologies, local biogas  digesters are frequently identified as a means of addressing energy poverty by  complementing distributed electricity generation with energy for cooking and thermal  services. Yet, while biodigesters have made a significant impact in some contexts, they  have proven a difficult technology to get right, and caution should be exercised when  advocating for biogas digesters as a short-term solution to energy poverty.  Biodigesters generate combustible gas from organic waste (from humans, animals, and  crop residues) through the decomposition of organic matter in an anaerobic  environment. In addition to gas, the slurry from biodigesters can be used as fertilizer,  which restores nutrients to the soil more effectively than regular composting21 (Smith et  al., 2014). The gas from a biodigester can be used for household cooking, requiring only  a slightly modified butane-burning stove (Bond & Templeton, 2011). Biogas can also be  used to generate electricity through a modified diesel generator, but this requires first  scrubbing the sulfur out of the gas, a task that is not amenable to remote locations. It is  also possible to use the gas to drive a fuel cell, but the gas again needs to be very  clean, and overall this is considered to be a development technology (Bond &  Templeton, 2011). The principal benefits of biodigesters for rural energy access, then,  are gas for cooking and slurry for fertilizer.  Biodigesters are a simple technology that has been in use as far back as the 10th  century BCE as well as in ancient China (Bond & Templeton, 2011). In its simplest form,  20 See footnote 18.  21 The WHO warns that slurry produced using human waste is not suitable for use as agricultural  fertilizer without pasteurization (Bond & Templeton, 2011).   the digester is merely a sealed chamber—usually a bladder placed in a hole in the  ground—into which is placed a mix of organic waste and water. Where biodigesters  have been successfully established, they have been shown to provide significant  benefits to households by decreasing household expenditures on fuelwood, saving time  on the collection of fuel, and decreasing cooking time (M. T. Smith et al., 2014). Biogas  is also considered a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, so long as the organic matter is  collected sustainably (Bond & Templeton, 2011).  Biodigesters require significant amounts of animal waste and water for their operation.  Requirements vary depending on the type of animal waste, which, in turn determines  the water requirements. On average, it is estimated that generating enough gas to cook  two meals a day for a family of five requires access to the equivalent of 20–30 kg of  cattle dung (or four to five head of cattle) along with an equivalent amount of water  (Bond & Templeton, 2011; Smith et al., 2014). Biodigesters are only effective in  temperatures between 15oC and 40oC. Below these temperatures, there is scope for  heating and stirring the slurry using solar energy, but such additions increase the plant’s  complexity. The labor costs of collecting the waste to feed the digester have proven  hard to overcome (Smith et al., 2014); as such, for biodigesters to run effectively,  animals generally need to be stabled on concrete floors (Bond & Templeton, 2011).  Such requirements mean that biodigesters are generally not suitable for urban  households, other than in large-scale facilities (such as next to abattoirs) (Smith et al.,  2014).  China has had significant success using biodigesters to improve energy access, with an  estimated 26–27 million plants in the country (Bhattacharyya, 2012; Bond & Templeton,  2011). India has also had some success, with about 4 million plants. Biogas, however,  is not necessarily a quick solution to energy poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. It took China  about 40 years to build its extensive infrastructure, with a great deal of support from the  state for research, financing, training for technicians, creation of supply chains, and  promotion of the technology. In addition, China had certain advantages, such as its  large manufacturing base, that were important in its success (Bhattacharyya, 2012).  Overall, it is estimated that China provided a subsidy of $200–$400 per household for  biogas plants (Bhattacharyya, 2012), with historic subsidies covering between 30 and  100 percent of plant costs in the 1980s and 1990s (Bond & Templeton, 2011).  Laborious maintenance procedures have been the principal challenge to the successful  deployment and use of biodigesters (Bond & Templeton, 2011; Modi et al., 2006). As a  result of poor maintenance, only about 50 percent of biodigesters around the world are  thought to be operational (Bond & Templeton, 2011). Such challenges even affect  China, where only about 60 percent of biogas digesters were estimated to be operating  normally in 2006. The number of plants currently operating in any single African country  is in the hundreds (Bond & Templeton, 2011).  Given high cattle counts in Africa, biodigesters could potentially have important effects  on energy poverty, but to address thermal energy needs completely, biodigesters will  need to incorporate crop residues more effectively. Currently, the gas produced using  crops residues is too high in carbon dioxide (Bond & Templeton, 2011). In addition,  stabling of cattle is uncommon in Africa and access to water is limited in certain areas  (Smith, 2011). Adoption of biogas also faces challenges in terms of social norms  57 Addressing energy poverty  surrounding the preparation of food using gas generated from human and animal waste.  Like LPG, biogas requires the use of a modern stove appliance and as such faces the  same barriers as efforts to promote improved cookstoves.  Finally, although biodigesters are a relatively cheap and simple technology, the capital  costs are still thought to be high compared with the incomes of rural, energy-poor  households in sub-Saharan Africa (Bond & Templeton, 2011). Studies suggest that  making the technology financially feasible to low-income rural households in South  Africa, for example, would require a subsidy of nearly $2,000 per household (at 2014  prices) and credit structures in which the repayment rate is on the order of 15 years.  Despite such high costs, even with subsidies, the welfare benefits of switching to biogas  were thought to be significant (Smith, 2011).  Although biogas presents significant opportunities for improving livelihoods, attempts to  implement biogas projects in developing countries have had limited success (Terrapon-  Pfaff et al., 2014). Overall, “biogas recovery technology has been a failure in many  developing countries with low rates of technology transfer and longevity and a  reputation for being difficult to operate and maintain” (Bond & Templeton, 2011, p. 347).   6. DEBATES AND ISSUES  CONCERNING ENERGY  ACCESS  Despite the complexity of the processes shaping household energy choices, as  well as the technical challenges involved in providing households with electricity,  there has been something of a simplification of the public conversation about  energy policy and the need to balance Africa’s imperative to develop with the  need to address climate change. Some debates have been simplified while other  crucial dynamics of effective energy policy have been overlooked. The rest of this  report explores the following questions and issue areas: (1) the merits of grid  versus decentralized approaches to providing energy access; (2) the challenge of  connection fees and last-mile connections; (3) the use of modern versus  traditional fuels in addressing energy poverty; (4) how best to address the  challenge of setting tariffs and providing energy subsidies, (5) the possibilities for  improving the economic benefits of electrification, and (6) challenges in financing  increased energy access.  GRID EXPANSION VERSUS DISTRIBUTED  TECHNOLOGIES  Recent debate has emerged over whether energy poverty is best addressed by  expanding the grid or by providing distributed energy technologies. Within this  debate, proponents on both sides have been guilty of playing up the advantages  of a particular approach while often overlooking its challenges and limitations.  They have contrasted generous appraisals of one technology with equivalently  unsympathetic accounts of competing technologies. Proponents of distributed  technologies, for example, argue that the grid is expensive and slow to roll out,  and that it is run by an unresponsive bureaucracy. Further they note that the grid  has failed to provide energy to the poor in sub-Saharan Africa and that it is based  on technology that drives climate change. In contrast, they characterize  distributed technologies as cheap to deliver, capable of quickly providing  electricity access to the poor, amenable to delivery by the private sector (thereby  avoiding the problems of the state bureaucracy), and well suited to using  renewable energy.  Proponents of expanding the grid point to relatively successful cases of improved  energy access through grid expansion, such as in Tunisia, South Africa, and  59 Addressing energy poverty  Vietnam (Khandker et al., 2009b; Modi et al., 2006) (see Text Box 6). They note  the higher cost of electricity from mini-grids and the low capacities of SHSs,  suggesting that such systems do not provide households with “real electricity”  (Wolfram, 2016).  Text Box 6: Expanding access to electricity in South Africa  South Africa is the only mainland sub-Saharan African country to have achieved  significant success at increasing access to electricity. Its experience, however, reveals  the importance of local contextual factors, as well as the complicated ways in which  local political and economic incentives play out in driving and frustrating effective  management of the power sector.  The scale of South Africa’s success at expanding access to electricity is notable. In  1993, a year before the end of apartheid, more than two-thirds of South African  households lacked access to electricity. By 2001, more than 2 million households (or  one-quarter of all households in the country) had been connected, principally through  expansion of the grid (Dinkelman, 2011), but also through the provision of solar home  systems (Azimoh et al., 2015). This progress took South Africa’s electrification rate from  34 to 70 percent (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). All of these new connections were fully  subsidized, and in 2003 electricity access was further supported through the  implementation of a free basic electricity allowance (Dinkelman, 2011).  Understanding why such dramatic change was possible requires looking at the political  and economic conditions dominant in the country at the time. First, in 1993, unlike other  African countries, South Africa had significant excess generation capacity, for several  reasons. It had access to abundant cheap coal. It had expertise in electricity generation,  driven in part by the large extractive industry activity in the country. Its energy sector  achieved high efficiencies by taking advantage of economies of scale and technical  innovations. And it had overinvested in generation capacity in the 1970s, based on  overly optimistic economic growth forecasts made at the time (Cowan & Mohlakoana,  2005). In addition, Eskom, the sole electricity provider in the country at the end of  apartheid, wanted to signal to the new government that it could provide electricity to  previously disadvantaged communities without the need to introduce private competition  (Dinkelman, 2011). The result of this combination of factors was an ambitious plan to  expand access to electricity that was supported by both the state and the utility, which  had the generation capacity to support such expansion.  As households have been connected (as of 2012, electrification rates stood at 85  percent (World Bank, 2012)) and the country’s economy has grown, however, the  situation of excess generation capacity has changed. As early as 1998 the government  reported that increasing demand would lead to electricity shortages. These warnings  were ignored on grounds that the utility might be privatized. Plans to increase  generation capacity were implemented in 2004, but by 2008 the country was  implementing load shedding, after generating reserves reached their lowest-ever levels  (Phaahla, 2015a). New production was focused on the construction of 4800MW, to be  supplied via a coal-fired power plant at Medupi. Although this project was meant to be   completed in four years at a cost of R69 billion ($9.5 billion), seven years later only one  of the plant’s proposed six reactors is online, providing 794MW of power. The project is  now scheduled for completion in 2019, with an updated cost estimate of R159 billion  ($12.2 billion) (Phaahla, 2015b). The project has also been mired in claims of  corruption. The ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC), owns a 25 percent  stake in the company that was awarded the construction contract, an outcome that  would net the ANC about R1 billion (Mail and Guardian, 2010).  The power utility, Eskom, currently finds itself in financial difficulty, with sovereign creditrating  agencies having downgraded it to junk status. A proposed 25 percent tariff  increase, aimed at remedying the situation, was rejected by the national energy  regulator, partly on the grounds that Eskom’s books are not transparently available for  public scrutiny (Phaahla, 2015a).  The South African story highlights a number of general lessons regarding the technical  and political-economic dimensions of energy access. First, the particular factors driving  access are unique to the country, and thus calling on countries to simply replicate  successes seen elsewhere may be of limited use. Second, the factors driving huge  increases in electricity access have little to do with generic features of good  governance, such as transparency or accountability. Third, if a country seeks to  increase access through grid expansion, it needs to focus heavily on expanding  generation capacity and maintaining the grid. Failure to do so will only result in a less  reliable grid for all users. Fourth, problems of governance and state capture of utilities  remains a threat, and in this respect generic good governance efforts can play a role.  Finally, challenges related to the financial viability of utilities and the issue of tariffs are  problems even in countries with mature power systems and established supply chains,  and even when cheap energy resources are abundant.  Considering all of the evidence, however, it is clear that neither technology is  likely to act as a panacea to the challenge of increasing electricity access given  the context in sub-Saharan Africa today (not to mention that electricity access is  not a panacea to energy poverty). The grid has failed too many people in Africa  for too long, providing energy to better-off urban groups while leaving behind  poor people in remote rural areas. At the same time, distributed energy  technologies face many challenges, including institutional ones that will require  support from the state, which will need to take a proactive role in legislation and  subsidization (see below). Without these, efforts focused on distributed  technology have similarly ended up benefiting relatively well-off individuals and  failed to bring access to the poorest members of society (TERI-GNESD, 2014;  World Bank, 2008). In addition, the services offered by distributed generation  sources are more expensive and often limited in quantity, limiting their capacity to  provide people with all of the energy services they need. As such, effectively  addressing energy access will require both connecting remote and isolated  households through distributed technologies and expanding the grid and  increasing access to it.  It is thought that grid extension will be the best means for increasing access in  urban areas, while the goal of increasing access to electricity among rural  populations will, in most cases, be best met through a focus on distributed  technologies. Such an approach will be faster to deploy and cheaper than waiting  for grid expansion. Areas with sufficient population density can be connected  through mini-grids, and the remainder can be connected using SHSs and solar  appliances (Alstone et al., 2015; World Bank & IEA, 2015).  Despite the advantages of distributed technologies in connecting households, the  eventual goal should be to connect everyone to the grid, which will provide  households with the best-quality electricity at the lowest price (Alstone et al.,  2015; Lee et al., 2016). A large grid will also allow for diversity in the energy  system and be crucial to supporting the high levels of renewable energy  penetration needed to address climate change (see Part 1 of this series). As  such, energy policy should focus simultaneously on leveraging investment in  distributed energy technologies and on improving the function and scale of the  grid, as well as access to it.  Although the specifics of rolling out on-grid and distributed technologies will vary  by country, based on factors such as the existing extent of the grid, institutional  capacity, economic capacity, geography, demography, topography, and the  availability of different resources (Schillebeeck et al., 2012), some common  features of energy policy will be necessary. Among other things, policies must (1)  increase grid-connected generation capacity, (2) increase grid efficiency, (3)  improve demand-side management, (4) ensure the affordability of electricity, (5)  ensure the quality of electricity infrastructure, (6) reduce perverse tax incentives  on distributed generation components (see below on subsidies), (7) support the  creation of effective supply chains (including installation and maintenance), (8)  undertake resource assessments, and (9) address uncertainty in the rollout of the  grid. The last of these should include making the plans for grid rollout explicit,  ensuring that distributed infrastructure will be able to integrate with the grid when  it arrives, and putting mechanisms in place to reduce the financial risks to private  sector actors regarding the arrival of the grid. All of these actions will be crucial to  driving private-sector investment in distributed energy systems. Finally, because  the process of rolling out the grid is likely to take many years, policies supporting  distributed generation need to include realistic estimates of likely cost reductions  in batteries and solar panels.  LAST-MILE CONNECTIONS  If issues of urban energy access are going to be solved via the grid, and if  distributed energy is only a stop-gap solution to efforts at electrification, then any  comprehensive energy access policy needs to consider how to deal with the   costs of actually connecting households to the grid—also known as “last-mile”  connections.  Issues of cost  The principal challenge when it comes to last-mile connections is their high cost,  which is consistently identified as a major impediment to improving electricity  access via grid expansion (K. Lee et al., 2014; Modi et al., 2006; Scott et al.,  2003) (see Text Box 7). Specifically, last-mile connections refer to the distribution  network for electricity (see Text Box 3). The costs of the distribution network  stem from the cost of wire and poles needed to carry the electricity, as well the  labor costs of installing this infrastructure. In general, the distribution network  comprises a medium-voltage line that carries the current from the transformer  linked to the transmission network. Households then connect to this medium-voltage  line via secondary distribution lines on which the voltage has been  stepped down again in order to deliver electricity to the household. On top of the  costs of these additions to the network, there can be costs to the household,  which must be wired and metered (see section on tariffs below) before it can  receive electricity. The cost of last-mile connections therefore generally depends  on how far the household is from the substation, which determines how much  wire, how many poles, and how much labor will be required. Last-mile  connections are a challenge because they pertain to every household that is to  be connected; given the number of households, the cost of connecting all  households can get very large very quickly (K. Lee et al., 2014).  The high cost of connecting households to the grid is often cited as grounds for  promoting distributed energy technologies ahead of grid expansion. This  argument is somewhat misleading. Mini-grid technologies also have costs  associated with connecting households; distribution lines must still run from the  generating plant to the households. As with the grid, the cost of these  connections depends on the distance between the households and the plant.  And if the goal is to ensure that the mini-grid infrastructure can later be  incorporated into the grid, the infrastructure linking households to the power plant  must match that needed to connect households to the grid.  Despite the fact that connection costs are an issue for mini-grids, the cost of  distribution infrastructure is often left out of mini-grid discussions, so much so  that even the HOMER model (which is the most prominent model for calculating  mini-grid sizing requirements) does not include inputs related to distribution costs  (Bhattacharyya, 2015). The difference between connection costs for mini-grids  and those for the main grid is that grid connection fees are usually standardized,  whereas in the case of mini-grids efforts are made to reduce the capital costs of  the system through the sorts of bespoke approaches that were described in the  section on mini-grids.  63 Addressing energy poverty  Despite the high costs of last-mile connections, however, studies consistently  find that the welfare and economic benefits of connecting to the grid far outweigh  the costs22 (Khandker et al., 2009a, 2009b). When large numbers of households  live within reach of the grid but are not connected to it—a condition termed living  “under the grid”23 (K. Lee et al., 2014)—the result is not only forgone welfare, but  also forgone revenues to the utility, which is unable to charge users and thus  unable to recoup on the investments made in expanding the grid. In Kenya it is  estimated that as many as 95 percent of households and 78 percent of  businesses that are close enough to be connected to the grid remain  unconnected (K. Lee et al., 2014). In Nigeria estimates suggest that 31 million  people could be living under the grid, accounting for 40 percent of all Nigerians  without electricity (Leo et al., n.d.).  To help reduce connection costs, innovations have included privatizing the  distribution network or using cheaper materials for the poles. In both cases,  however, it should be remembered that maintaining the infrastructure and  ensuring the fairness of tariffs are important for long-term sustainability. Another  option is to bundle many households so that connection costs are shared  between them. This approach has shown to reduce connection costs  dramatically (see Text Box 7) (K. Lee et al., 2014; Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  22 Benefits exceed costs by as much as 150 percent in Bangladesh (Khandker et al., 2009a) and  are four times greater in Vietnam.  23 This term was created by K. Lee et al. (2014) to describe households that do not fit into the  binary categories of “on the grid” (i.e., connected to the grid) and “off the grid” (too far away to  connect to the grid).  24 In 2002 the exact cost for an individual connection was 10,000 Botswana pula.  Text box 7: Connection fees and bundling of households  While the actual cost of connecting to the grid varies by country (owing to variations in  the costs of materials and labor), it is often prohibitively high. In Kenya, for example, it  currently costs about $2,000 to connect a single household to the grid, assuming that  the household is located less than 200 meters from the substation (K. Lee et al.,  2014). In Botswana in 2002, full cost recovery on connection costs meant that it cost  about $1,000 to connect a household to the grid24 (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Given  that average annual household income in Africa was $762 in 2008 (Lakner &  Milanovic, 2013), it is clear why many households remain unconnected even if they  are located close to the grid.  One potentially useful option to get around the problem of high connection costs  (assuming population densities are high enough) is to bundle households together  when connecting them (Modi et al., 2006). Bundling households takes advantage of   Obviously the process of bundling households creates coordination as well as  bureaucratic challenges: households first have to know and understand that a  system for bundling them exists, then they must agree to act together and inform  the utility of their willingness to connect. Given that challenges around processing  paperwork have been shown to be an impediment to connecting individual  households that are currently under the grid (Broto et al., 2015), these challenges  should not be overlooked, and energy policies must include allowances to deal  with them. Notably, however, such challenges are thought likely to be inherent in  operationalizing the sort of bespoke energy systems that will be required to make  mini-grids cost competitive.  25 This is, in fact, a classic quality of the grid’s economies of scale and its character as an almost  perfect monopoly: capital costs of extending the grid are high, but once those capital costs have  been paid, the marginal cost of adding one more household to the grid is relatively small.  26 Under the bundling scheme households paid a Pula 100 down payment of 5%, before paying the  other 95% back over a period of 18, 60 or 180 months (Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  27 This result assumes that the distribution line would be extended 200 meters from the substation  and then connected to every household within 30 meters of that line.  28 Notably, this is the same price as the popular solar kits sold by M-Kopa.  the fact that once one house is connected, it becomes cheaper to connect any  neighboring house because the necessary low-voltage power line is already in  place.25 Bundling households involves extending low-voltage lines to their maximum  distance from the substation and then connecting all of the households that lie within  a short distance of that low-voltage line. Instead of connecting only one household at  the end of the low-voltage power line, this approach connects multiple households to  a single line. This allows the cost of connection (in terms of low-voltage power lines,  poles, and labor) to be split among all the connected households, significantly  reducing the cost.  This approach has been used successfully in Botswana, where the connection policy  was amended after it was found that individual households were unable to afford the  full connection cost. In that scheme four or more households had to come together to  apply for a connection. Doing so brought the cost of connecting an individual  household in 2002 down from about $1,000 to about $20026 (Prasad & Visagie,  2006). Likewise, theoretical work in Kenya has shown that bundling households that  are currently under the grid could bring prices down from $2,000 per connection to  $80 per connection.27 At this price it has been estimated that households would only  have to generate $10 a year in terms of improved welfare from their access to  electricity in order to make the connection welfare-improving. Furthermore, the same  analysis found that households only need to be bundled into groups of six in order to  get connection fees to around $200 per household28 (K. Lee et al., 2014). The low  connection costs for mini-grids take advantage of this this bundling approach.  65 Addressing energy poverty  Beyond cost: Tenure and connections  Although discussions and policies about last-mile connections often focus on  cost, it is important to recognize that some households remain under the grid  because of institutional challenges related to land tenure and the informal nature  of settlements in urban areas. Informal dwellings often lack an address, which  makes it impossible to receive bills or have a meter installed. Likewise, informal  dwellings that are located on land owned by someone other than the dweller,  close to other infrastructure (such as roads or railways), or in flood plains can  create problems for all manner of service delivery, as the state is usually  unwilling, or legally unable, to provide infrastructure or services under such  conditions (Cowan & Mohlakoana, 2005; Modi et al., 2006). Since it is often the  poorest individuals who occupy such marginal land, efforts to address energy  access among poor populations need to include allowances for such challenges.  It is possible that distributed energy technologies, which have few permanent  infrastructural features (such as solar appliances or SHSs), might play an  important role in improving energy access for people living on legally  unserviceable land, but no such cases were identified in this research.  Finally, in addition to the above measures, given the low incomes of many  unconnected rural households, energy policy will need to include some  mechanism for financing the costs, as households are unlikely to have access to  capital on the scale required. The most common means for doing this is to  include some portion of the connection fee in the electricity tariff, which allows  households to pay the connection fee over an extended period. On top of this, in  some cases, subsidies will still be required to connect very poor households  (Modi et al., 2006; Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  TARIFFS AND SUBSIDIES  Issues of tariffs and subsidies may be the most crucial element of any electricity  access effort. If tariffs are too low to allow for cost recovery, then electricity  infrastructure will not be sustainable in the long term because there will not be  enough resources available for maintenance, replacement of components, and  ongoing investment (Africa Progress Panel, 2015; ARE, n.d.; Prasad & Visagie,  2006). At the same time, if tariffs are based only on cost recovery and financial  sustainability, the poorest populations are likely to continue to be excluded from,  or remain without, the benefits of access to significant quantities of electricity. It is  thus widely appreciated that some form of targeted subsidies will be necessary to  enable energy access among certain groups (ARE, n.d.; Bhattacharyya & Palit,  2016; World Bank, 2008) (see Text Box 4).   Electricity tariffs  African grid tariffs are much higher than the tariffs paid by consumers in other  parts of the developing world—as much as three times higher on average (World  Bank, 2013)—but they are not considered sufficient to cover the costs of energy  generation. The reason for this seeming paradox is that historically weak tariff  collection and an unwillingness to charge the full recovery cost of electricity  infrastructure have resulted in financial problems for many African utilities. These  financial problems have, in turn, prevented utilities from investing suitably in  generation capacity and maintaining the grid. The result is a grid that is inefficient  (experiencing high losses) as well as a lack of finance for new generation  capacity. Together these problems have left many African countries reliant on  leased, emergency generation capacity, which uses expensive fuels such as oil  (Africa Progress Panel, 2015; Eberhard et al., 2008). Consequently, although  Africans now pay some of the highest tariffs in the world, they are still not  sufficient to cover the costs of expensive generation (Africa Progress Panel,  2015; Eberhard et al., 2008). Africans will need to pay higher tariffs in the short  run in order to bring tariffs down in the long run. Raising tariffs, however, is  politically difficult in Africa (Eberhard et al., 2008), where many countries have  displayed strong political opposition to efforts at raising prices in order to make  utilities financially sound (World Bank, 2005). In 2008, a survey of 20 African  countries identified only 10 that were collecting tariffs sufficient to cover historical  operating costs and only 6 that were able to cover all historical costs, including  the cost of capital (Eberhard et al., 2008).  Dynamics of this sort show how important it is to get tariffs right, ensure bill  collection, and limit theft. In the long run, if the utility is not financially sustainable  the cost of electricity will go up. Given the gross mismanagement of African  utilities that has led to this dire situation, some advocates of distributed electricity  solutions argue that the answer to Africa’s energy access challenge does not lie  with grid expansion. Furthermore, such high utility tariffs in Africa improve the  competitiveness of distributed technologies, which have struggled to be  competitive with the utilities in Asia.  Tariff structures can take many forms, each suited to a different context. Possibly  the simplest is a flat tariff, whereby all consumers pay the same amount  regardless of how much electricity they use. Such a simple structure makes bill  collection straightforward. It can also help increase the energy consumption of  poor households, which pay the same amount regardless of how much electricity  they use. However, flat tariffs will almost certainly be unsustainable as  households start to use more energy than they are effectively paying for,  resulting in problems for the electricity generator. In addition, a flat tariff can  exclude poor households that do not have the income to pay for the regular fee  (Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  67 Addressing energy poverty  Excessive consumption of electricity in mini-grids, based on a simple flat tariff  system, can be prevented by installing load limiters, which limit how much  electricity any one user can consume. Such an approach ensures that the  generation capacity of the system is not overloaded (which is important for longterm  sustainability in terms of battery use; see Text Box 3), though load limiters  increase up-front system costs (Deshmukh et al., 2013; TERI-GNESD, 2014).  An alternative to a flat tariff is a consumption-based tariff, whereby consumers  pay based on the amount of electricity they use. This system is much more  sustainable because users cover the full cost of their consumption. It also creates  an incentive for demand-side management. The downside is that the system  requires the installation, maintenance, and checking of meters as part of bill  collection—all of which increase the costs and management complexity of the  overall system (Deshmukh et al., 2013). In cases where the amount of electricity  being consumed is very small, the cost of metering can be hard to justify. The  use of meters can also result in unforeseen problems: households have been  known to tamper with them in order to steal electricity. One way to address this is  to place meters on the outside of people’s homes so that tampering can easily be  identified. A final advantage of meters is that they allow for energy to be priced  differentially (for example, making it more expansive at peak times). This  approach can help redistribute the load on the system, increasing the system’s  overall financial viability (see Text Box 3); it is not possible with a flat tariff  (Bhattacharyya, 2015).  Progressive tariffs are a final option, whereby the price a household pays for  electricity is based on a sliding scale. Users who consume the most electricity  pay the highest tariff, whereas smaller consumers pay a lower tariff. This system  allows larger (usually wealthier) consumers to subsidize the access of smaller  (usually poorer) consumers. It also gives households incentives to manage their  demand. Again, such a system requires metering and suffers the associated  challenges. While progressive tariffs might seem to be the obvious choice, their  suitability can depend on how energy is consumed. In many parts of sub-  Saharan Africa it is common for households with a grid connection to provide  connections to neighbors who live in informal structures and charge them for the  electricity they use. Under this system, because the connected household is  consuming a large amount of electricity, it will be subject to a higher tariff, which  is then passed on to the informally connected (and usually poor) households,  defeating the purpose of the progressive pricing system (Meikle & Bannister,  2003). Progressive subsidies may also overburden wealthy households, causing  them to use less energy or replace electricity with LPG (Cook, 2011). In such  cases the viability of the overall tariff system can be compromised as the utility  loses revenue and the possibility for cross-subsidization is undermined  Finally, for access purposes, it may be necessary to ensure that bill collection  schedules coincide with income cycles in the areas of newly connected   households. For example, subsistence households do not earn monthly incomes,  but rather receive income at the end of the harvest season. Though matching bill  collection to periods when households have money can be important for  improving access and sustainability, it tends to increase the administrative cost of  bill collection (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Scott et al., 2003). An effective  means for getting around such problems has been the installation of pre-paid  meters. While there is some cost to install these meters, as well as institutional  requirements to ensure they are maintained, pre-paid meters reduce collection  costs, and most reports indicate that households are happy to be able to avoid  surprise electricity bills (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Broto et al., 2015; Mushi,  2014). Possibilities for pre-paid meters are also thought to be growing with the  advent of mobile money29 and cell phone technologies, which allow users to  purchase electricity on a pre-paid basis using a cell phone. As with regular  meters, though, tampering with pre-paid meters has been observed in Tanzania,  resulting in theft of electricity and financial challenges for the utility (Mushi, 2014).  Innovative models for ensuring bill collection—such as having bills be the  responsibility of groups of people in order to create peer pressure for payment—  have also been shown to increase collection rates (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016).  While tariffs are important for cost recovery, and despite the challenging situation  in Africa, researchers have pointed out that simply raising tariffs so that they  cover costs would place too great a burden on households (Africa Progress  Panel, 2015). For example, where African grid tariffs are as high as $0.25/kWh,  for a household consuming as little as 50kWh/month, monthly expenditure on  electricity will quickly exceed 5 percent of their income (assuming household  income of $260/month) (Eberhard et al., 2008) (see Text Box 4).  In this regard, a singular focus on cost recovery as the basis for setting tariffs  (itself a by-product of the privatization of utilities) is thought to have resulted in  skewing energy access heavily toward urban areas and nonpoor groups who  have the ability to pay (Mostert, 2008; Scott et al., 2003). In Botswana, for  example, such an approach is thought to have prevented 40 percent of rural  households from accessing the grid (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Since consumers  usually pay for their connection to the grid through an additional cost on the tariff,  it is clear that simply pushing for full cost recovery on tariffs will not be a viable  solution to improving energy access, especially among the poor. Energy access  efforts must include targeted subsidies to support both connection fees and  electricity tariffs, for both on-grid and distributed technologies (Africa Progress  Panel, 2015; Deshmukh et al., 2013; Eberhard et al., 2008).  29 Mobile money creates opportunities for novel financing of distributed energy infrastructure as well  as possibilities for improving bill collection, but the exact degree to which access to mobile  money can be advanced across the continent is debated; see for example (McLeod, 2016).  69 Addressing energy poverty  Electricity Subsidies  Electricity subsidies can take a number of different forms. Geographic targeting,  whereby people in a certain area all receive a specific subsidy, is straightforward  to administer, but it allows leakage to the nonpoor as income does not always  correlate neatly with geography. Means testing (or tariff setting based on  household wealth) is more effective for targeting, but it is expensive and time-consuming  to administer because it requires finding a way to continuously  assess household wealth. As with the progressive tariff system mentioned  earlier, subsidies can also be provided based on consumption (Prasad & Visagie,  2006), and again prepaid meters have an advantage in that subsidies can simply  include a basic amount of free electricity each month (Bhattacharyya, 2012).  Consumption-based, or metered, subsidies are thought to be an effective and  cost-effective means of targeting subsidies (once the cost of the meter and its  maintenance are factored in), but they are not useful for energy forms other than  electricity (see below).  It is important to note that unless the issue of last-mile connections is addressed,  any subsidy on electricity consumption will end up benefiting the relatively  wealthy who have been able to get a connection (Eberhard et al., 2008; World  Bank, 2005). In this way, electricity subsidies can be regressive in the same way  that fossil-fuel subsidies have traditionally been (see below). The same can be  said when subsidies are provided only to grid-connected consumers, while tariffs  for mini-grids are negotiated in an unregulated environment with the provider.  Such cases present a bias toward the grid which, given the barriers to  connecting, likely results in a regressive subsidy.  Whatever system of subsidy is considered, the cost of targeting should stay  low—certainly lower than the benefit any household might receive from the  subsidy (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Beyond subsidies delivered directly to the  consumer, electricity subsidies can also include loans for energy infrastructure at  below-market rates or without conditions or security, tax breaks on components,  state investments in capacity building, removal of import tariffs on electricity  components, and support for capital costs (ARE, n.d.; Bhattacharyya, 2015;  Deshmukh et al., 2013; Prasad & Visagie, 2006).  The desire for the private sector to play a significant role in the delivery of minigrids,  as well as the high cost of energy delivered by these systems, means that  subsidies of some variety are thought to be essential for determining their  scalability, equitability, and long-term viability (Deshmukh et al., 2013; Mostert,  2008; TERI-GNESD, 2014). There may be some low-hanging fruit in this respect  around tariffs and duties. For example, duties cause PV systems to be three  times more expensive in Ghana than they are in Bangladesh and make small  hydropower twice as expensive in African countries as it is in Sri Lanka (ARE,   n.d.). Addressing such issues is a simple way to bring down the costs of capital  on these systems and increase their attractiveness to the private sector.  Despite such potential reforms, however, and regardless of the declining costs of  technology, subsidies for mini-grids may need to be substantial (Bhattacharyya &  Palit, 2016). In Bangladesh, for example, even when all the capital costs of (PVdiesel  hybrid) mini-grids were covered, costs could still not compete with grid  prices (Bhattacharyya, 2015) (see Text Box 4). Thus, for a system to be  sustainable, subsidies might be needed to cover not only capital costs, but also  operation and maintenance costs, as well as the costs of replacing components  in renewable energy systems (Bhattacharyya, 2015; TERI-GNESD, 2014).  Fossil-fuel subsidies  In light of the relatively limited role electricity will play in meeting thermal needs,  there is also a need to discuss fossil-fuel subsidies. Advocates concerned with  climate change and energy access frequently criticize fossil-fuel subsidies (Africa  Progress Panel, 2015), but from an energy poverty perspective, fossil-fuel  subsidies are simply another form of energy subsidy. To this end, some authors  argue that fossil-fuel subsidies have played an important role in advancing the  adoption of modern fuels (kerosene and LPG) in low-income households  (Eberhard et al., 2008).  Despite such gains, the major challenge with fossil-fuel subsidies is that they are  frequently consumed by people who are not poor, and only small proportions of  subsidies end up supporting poor people. The IEA estimates that of the $409  billion in fossil-fuel subsidies that are paid globally, only $35 billion (or 8 percent)  reached the poorest income groups30 (IEA, 2010). Since nonpoor groups use  more energy than poor groups, blanket subsidies on fossil fuels end up benefiting  the wealthy far more than they do the poor—essentially making them highly  regressive (Bacon et al., 2010; Meikle & Bannister, 2003).  Compared with electricity, efforts to target fossil-fuel subsidies have met with  limited success. Fossil fuels can be transported, which allows for theft and black  market sales, and with some tinkering on the internal combustion engine, many  fossil fuels are relatively substitutable. For example, subsidized kerosene—a fuel  used predominantly by the poor and therefore not susceptible to consumption by  wealthy households—has been used to adulterate diesel, which is then used in  far greater quantities by wealthy groups (Bacon et al., 2010). In India, even when  means-testing was used—Indian households had to carry cards qualifying them  to receive subsidized kerosene—the relatively high price of diesel soon saw a  black market develop around kerosene, so that it again entered the automotive  30 These groups are defined as the poorest 20 percent of a country’s population.  71 Addressing energy poverty  sector31 (Bhattacharyya, 2012). Likewise, poor targeting of LPG in India has  resulted in policies benefiting the wealthy, as poor groups could not afford the  appliances necessary to capitalize on the LPG subsidies. In addition people  modified their cars to run on LPG (Bhattacharyya, 2012). Problems of leakage  can be partially addressed by ensuring that subsidies are supported with policies  that allow households to purchase appliances and by dying kerosene blue to  prevent adulteration with diesel (Bhattacharyya, 2012).  Fossil-fuel subsidies can also place a significant strain on the national budget,  especially if fuel prices fluctuate and the fuel is imported. Further complicating  such dynamics is the fact that once fuel subsidies are in place, political pressure  makes them very difficult to remove (Bhattacharyya, 2012).  Overall, it is simple to note that tariffs need to cover costs, but the imperative for  cost recovery should not inhibit people’s access to energy. Implementing  effective tariff structures and subsidies in particular African contexts however will  likely prove extremely challenging. Given that utilities are currently unsustainable,  that grid tariffs are currently high, and that distributed energy tariffs will be even  higher, the challenge of managing the balance between access and sustainability  is significant, especially if one considers the weak economic base of many  African countries. On top of this, the potential for graft is an obvious concern  regarding subsidies—whether they are for fossil fuels or electricity access.  Subsidies therefore need to be accompanied by a strong regulatory environment,  with strong provisions for transparency and accountability, to ensure that they are  fiscally sound (Modi et al., 2006). Any serious policy on energy access needs to  include some account of how to resolve these challenges, based on realistic  appraisals of state capacity, poor people’s current reliance on fossil fuel  subsidies, the imperatives around energy access, and any expected price  changes in electricity generation capacity and energy prices. Finally, if subsidies  are meant to allow people to gain access to energy on a temporary basis until  such access allows them to increase their income to the point that they no longer  need the subsidy, then energy access policies need to include some realistic  account of the likely impacts of energy access on economic development. This  last issue is a point to which the report now turns.  “ELECTRICITY FOR DEVELOPMENT” OR  “ELECTRICITY AND DEVELOPMENT”  Investments in electricity infrastructure have long been justified on the grounds  that they will drive important improvements in economic development. Further to  this, proponents of energy access in particular have argued that improving  access will have more profound impacts on human development than providing  large-scale industries with electricity and hoping that trickle-down economics will  play their part. Hopes that access to electricity will drive local economic  development are also crucial given the challenges around the cost of energy and  the scale of subsidies required, as discussed above. Unless electrification drives  an increase in incomes, and therefore an increase in people’s ability to pay for  modern energy access, electrification efforts may well become unsustainable.  However, as discussed earlier empirical evidence on the impacts of electrification  on economic development has been somewhat ambiguous, showing broad  generalizable impacts in some cases and no noticeable effect in others.  Furthermore, where impacts have been observed they tend to accrue  disproportionately to the wealthy (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Prasad & Visagie,  2006; World Bank, 2008) and to women (Dinkelman, 2011). Although it remains  the case that electricity is necessary for the sorts of increased productivity that  characterize rich industrialized (and post-industrialized) economies, access to  electricity is also an insufficient condition for driving economic gains. It seems  that simply providing electricity will not drive the kinds of economic development  that are so desired and so necessary (Khandker et al., 2009b).  To explain the relative lack of economic impacts of electrification, authors have  pointed out that economic development has rarely been included as an explicit  goal of electrification efforts. As such, investment in increasing access to  electricity has usually not been accompanied by policies aimed at driving  economic development (Schillebeeck et al., 2012; Terrapon-Pfaff et al., 2014).  To generate economically viable small businesses, however, households need a  range of other resources beyond electricity. For example, a household that  wished to start up a cottage woodworking industry would find it impossible to do  so without access to the credit required to make investments in heavy-duty  woodworking equipment, regardless of whether it has access to electricity or not.  Likewise, the impact of electricity access on households’ income diversification  will be limited if those households do not get better access to markets through  improved road infrastructure (ARE, n.d.; Practical Action, 2014). Such  considerations are especially important given that the populations most likely to  suffer from poor electricity access are also likely to be remote from other  necessary resources, such as roads, schools, hospitals, and markets (Prasad &  Visagie, 2006).  Thus while the provision of electricity is an important factor shaping development  outcomes, policies aimed at achieving energy access should not assume that  economic development will be an inevitable outcome (Terrapon-Pfaff et al.,  2014). Instead, efforts at improving access to electricity need to be located within  the context of broader development policies and integrated with other supportive  development infrastructure (Schillebeeck et al., 2012). In this respect some  73 Addressing energy poverty  authors have specifically pointed out the need to ensure that efforts to promote  energy access need to be located within the larger context of an energy  transition, which links energy for thermal needs, electricity for lighting, and  electricity for national industry. In this conception, addressing energy poverty  needs to be linked with addressing Africa’s disproportionately small generation  capacity (Sokona et al., 2012).  MODERN VERSUS TRADITIONAL FUELS  Given that access to electricity is unlikely to completely address energy poverty,  particularly for thermal services, it is important to consider how to provide energy  for cooking and heating while reducing the harm caused by the use of  “traditional,” or solid biomass, fuels.  Countries’ efforts in this area have reflected the dominant concerns about the  impacts of solid biomass fuel use on health and the environment (mainly  deforestation), as well as the associated drudgery. The result has been a push to  move individuals up the “energy ladder” and away from such fuels. As  mentioned, much of this focus has fallen on electrification, or encouraging the  use of modern, petroleum-based fuels. Policies on biomass have historically  been neglected (Owen et al., 2013), and where they exist they have been  criticized for being incoherent and disjointed (Zulu & Richardson, 2013). In 2013,  for example, 35 governments in sub-Saharan Africa had strategic targets to  increase access to electricity, 13 had targets related to promotion of modern  fuels (kerosene, LPG, and natural gas), and only 7 had policies related to  improved wood or charcoal stoves (Zulu & Richardson, 2013).  More recently, however, some researchers have come to question the simple  rejection of biomass fuels. New work has made clear that households cannot  easily replace biomass, and its use is in fact expected to increase in sub-  Saharan Africa through 2030 (Malla & Timilsina, 2014). In addition, studies have  revealed that biomass supply chains are extensive. The process of producing,  distributing, and selling charcoal provides a significant number of jobs (see Text  Box 8) (Clancy, 2008; Lambe et al., 2015; Nissing & von Blottnitz, 2010; Owen et  al., 2013) and is a potentially important source of livelihood diversification among  women (Jones et al., 2016) and a social safety-net for rural populations (Zulu &  Richardson, 2013). Such extensive supply chains also mean that wood and  charcoal are readily and reliably available across sub-Saharan Africa in  quantities that suit the income characteristics of poor households (Broto et al.,  2015; Zulu & Richardson, 2013).   Finally, the idea that the collection of biomass drives deforestation has come to  be heavily contested (see Text Box 9), and the impacts on climate have come to  be viewed potentially favorably when compared with improved, petroleum-based  fuels. To this end, some authors have pointed out that while countries in Africa  are generally attempting to reduce their use of biomass, countries such as  Germany are working to increase the use of biomass in grid-scale energy  generation through the use of wood pellets (Owen et al., 2013). Overall, authors  have begun to point out that rather than viewing biomass as a fuel to be avoided,  developing countries should focus on how to best manage biomass in  households in ways that exploit its advantages while limiting its damaging effects.  Text Box 9: Rethinking environmental concerns about biomass  Environmental concerns about the sustainability of biomass as a source of household  energy have their origins in the environmental writings of the 1970s (e.g., Ekholm,  1975), which focused on problems of population growth and forecast that increasing  demand on wood stores would soon decimate forests, with significant impacts for  society (Clancy, 2008). Despite the fact that such predictions clearly did not come to  pass, the narrative they spawned remains common. Some authors and policy makers  Text Box 8: Charcoal and livelihoods  Because of the informal (and sometimes illegal) nature of charcoal supply chains,  their economic impacts are frequently overlooked in policy research. Studies of  biomass supply chains have revealed, however, that they support a significant  number of livelihoods and that the transport, processing, and retail of charcoal are  worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually (Mwampamba et al., 2013a). In  Rwanda, for example, the charcoal sector is estimated to generate $77 million  annually while in Kenya it is estimated to be about $450 million— equivalent to the  country’s tea industry. The story is similar in Tanzania, where charcoal is estimated  to contribute $650 million to the economy—more than 5.8 times the combined value  of tea and coffee production in the country (Zulu & Richardson, 2013).  In terms of jobs, charcoal production in Malawi was estimated to employ 120,000–  140,000 people in 2008. A study from Addis Ababa points out that on a single  market day in 1984, 42,000 suppliers were found to be transporting traditional fuels.  After the government put in place a strategy to limit the use of fuelwood in the city  (which successfully reduced fuelwood use from 70 to 13 percent), that number had  dropped to 3,500 suppliers. Although about 2,000 jobs were thought to be added in  the small business sector through the manufacture of electric, kerosene, and  improved biomass cookstoves, the Ethiopian government was reluctant to  acknowledge the problem of lost livelihoods as a result of a shift away from charcoal  fuelwood as a primary household energy source (Shanko & Rouse, 2005).  75 Addressing energy poverty  still describe the imminent dangers of severe environmental degradation, and even  desertification, as a result of poor households’ reliance on solid biomass for energy  (Owen et al., 2013). This concern has sparked associated worries about the impacts on  water runoff and climate change.  Some contemporary researchers have begun to question this view. Concerns about  fuelwood have largely been dismissed; it has been found that fuelwood is usually  collected from dead trees and its impacts on forest stocks and climate change are  therefore negligible (Bailis et al., 2005; Modi et al., 2006). Concerns about charcoal,  however, remain, as charcoal is produced from forest stock. Charcoal has been  identified as contributing to deforestation (Lewis & Pattanayak, 2012; Malla & Timilsina,  2014; Modi et al., 2006) and driving carbon emissions (Bailis et al., 2005; Bailis et al.,  2015).  However, the exact impact of charcoal collection on forest stocks is also now contested  (Bailis et al., 2015), with numerous studies questioning the link between deforestation  and charcoal production (Mwampamba et al., 2013a). Reviews of the literature looking  at the impacts of charcoal production on deforestation have found that the impact is  both relatively minor and reversible (Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013; Clancy, 2008; Owen  et al., 2013). In terms of scale, charcoal production is estimated to account for only 2–7  percent of global deforestation (including cases of charcoal production for industrial  use, as in Brazil) (Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013). More recent analysis notes that only 4  percent of land across the world’s tropics constitutes regions in which the majority of  traditional fuelwood is harvested unsustainably. Within sub-Saharan Africa, the vast  majority of traditional fuelwood is thought to be harvested sustainably (Bailis et al.,  2015).  The impacts of charcoal collection vary across sub-Saharan Africa depending on  particular practices of forest cutting. West Africa is characterized by selective forest  clearing, while in East and southern Africa clear-cutting is prominent (Chidumayo &  Gumbo, 2013). The largest contiguous area of concern is thought to be a particular  swath of East Africa (Eritrea, western Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi).  Southern Africa contains areas of concern, but none of them large and contiguous  (Bailis et al., 2015).  Even where clear-cutting is taking place, authors note that forest regrowth has been  observed (Mwampamba et al., 2013a; Ribot, 1999) over periods of 9–30 years,  depending on the region (Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013). How land is managed after  being cleared has been shown to matter more than the fact that land was cleared at all  (Bailis, 2009; Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013).  Overall, the idea that forest clearance for charcoal production drives deforestation has  come to be questioned. Authors now suggest that its impact seems to more closely  resemble degradation, particularly when compared with other drivers of deforestation,  such as commercial tree felling or the conversion of land for agricultural use  (Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013; Clancy, 2008).  Charcoal production also raises questions about impact on runoff and climate change.  Impacts on runoff are thought to be quickly undermined by forest regeneration, while  wetland clearance and reservoir construction are thought to have much greater effects   on runoff dynamics than forest clearance for charcoal production (Chidumayo &  Gumbo, 2013). With regard to climate change, carbon that is released in charcoal  burning is thought to be eventually sequestered in new forest growth (Chidumayo &  Gumbo, 2013). Even at these lower levels, though, the impacts of traditional fuel use  can generate relatively large proportions of the carbon emissions produced in countries  with few industrial emissions (Bailis et al., 2015). Thus, efforts to reduce emissions by  promoting and using improved cookstoves remain important.  While felling trees for charcoal use is thought to have only local and temporary effects,  kiln sites have been found to have more permanent effects owing to the high  temperatures that permanently damage soils. Although kiln sites are relatively small,  forest recovery in such sites is limited, because forests do not recover in the medium  term but are replaced instead by shrubby plant species (Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013).  Among the damaging effects of traditional biomass, none is more severe than the  impact on people’s health. Further, while the impacts on deforestation may be  limited and time bound (see Text Box 9), forest clearance still temporarily  undermines access to forest services, while the drudgery of collecting fuelwood  represents a welfare cost to the women and children to whom this task frequently  falls. Moreover, in the future increased demand from growing urban centers may  weaken the sustainability of this practice. This is especially the case in semi-arid  areas, where the relative impacts of charcoal production on forest cover change  may be greater than those of land clearance for agricultural purposes (Sedano et  al., 2016). Under such circumstances, even if forest degradation is temporary,  combustion of biomass produces carbon immediately while regrowth takes time.  Under conditions of increased future demand, this will result in increases in the  total carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Efforts to promote improved cookstoves,  which might serve to limit these pressures are, therefore, crucial.  As mentioned earlier, efforts on this front have been bolstered by the creation of  the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (Africa Progress Panel, 2015;  Agbemabiese et al., 2012; Practical Action, 2014), which has a goal of providing  100 million cookstoves by 2020. Considering that there are expected to be 3  billion people in rural Africa and Asia by that time, the Alliance for Clean  Cookstoves will reach only about 16 percent of the needy population (assuming 5  people per household) (Bhattacharyya, 2012). This suggests that although the  current focus on cookstoves is an improvement on historical neglect, there is a  need to put even greater resources into the project.  Although there is a strong case for acknowledging the extent to which the supply  chains around solid biomass support livelihoods, such supply chains are thought  to be characterized by high levels of inequality. Middlemen and wholesalers are  able to capture most of the value, while individuals involved in production and  retail are relatively exploited (Zulu & Richardson, 2013). Efforts to support the  creation of inclusive and sustainable supply chains for solid biomass are  therefore an essential element of any energy access effort.  77 Addressing energy poverty  Finally, regardless of the benefits of improved cookstoves, the use of solid  biomass for cooking will result in excessive drudgery and unacceptable health  impacts, most of which will be borne by women, who are usually responsible for  these tasks. Although it is unclear exactly how to address these problems, a  concerted effort needs to be dedicated to solving such problems, while  acknowledging the likely persistence of solid biomass fuels in the home.  Overall, considering the question of modern versus traditional fuels, the intention  here is not to promote a single fuel or approach over another. Instead it is to  point out that different fuels have different impacts involving complicated tradeoffs.  Petroleum-based fuels are more efficient and have important health  advantages over solid biomass, but they also drive climate change (Alstone et  al., 2015; Bailis et al., 2005; Clancy, 2008) and have made only limited inroads  into the household energy economies of the poor. On the other hand, biomass  fuels provide important access to energy and sustain livelihoods. The use of  traditional fuels is also not simply going to go away. In sub-Saharan Africa, the  number of people reliant on biomass fuels is expected to increase between 2014  and 2030 from 793 million people to 823 million (IEA, 2016). As such, a simple  view that treats biomass as a “traditional” or “backward” fuel, with no place in  development policy will undermine efforts to address energy poverty.  Any serious policy aimed at addressing energy poverty needs to engage with the  complexity of factors determining how households choose their fuels. This will  need to include an explicit focus on the role of biomass in households. Important  dimensions of such policy will include the promotion of improved cookstoves,  including standards for their construction, tax incentives for their manufacture,  subsidies and credit systems to support their purchase, awareness raising about  their value, and investments in the infrastructure needed for their manufacture  (such as electricity) and their supply (such as roads) (Agbemabiese et al., 2012).  Likewise, policies will need to include plans for community-based sustainable  forest management, and the creation of policies that ensure the effective  distribution of wealth within the charcoal value chain (Clancy, 2008). Finally,  efforts that seek to improve the efficiency of charcoal use or provide effective  biomass substitutes, such as briqueting, can also play a role in alleviating the  impacts of degradation or address concerns in cases where charcoal production  is unsustainable (Mwampamba et al., 2013b).  FINANCING  It is clear that finding the financing to tackle energy poverty will be a major  challenge. This financing will need to cover increased generation capacity,  upgrades to the grid, connection fees, and subsidies both to cover basic energy  consumption and to reduce the barriers to the private sector. Looking at universal   energy access alone, reports suggest costs of the order of $17–$24 billion  annually (Africa Progress Panel, 2015; IEA, 2012; IEG, n.d.). About 65 percent of  that money is needed to support new generation, and approximately 25 percent  is needed for transmission and distribution (IEG, n.d.). In addition, an estimated  $3.8 billion per year is required to achieve universal access to clean cooking  facilities (IEA, 2012). On top of this an estimated $20–$35 billion needs to be  invested annually in plants (67 percent) and transmission and distribution (23  percent) to meet current and future demand in Africa (Africa Progress Panel,  2015; IEG, n.d.). These large sums of money dwarf current investment in the  sector: about $8 billion annually (Africa Progress Panel, 2015). The picture looks  worse in in countries with low levels of energy access, where public and private  investments have been only about $3.6 billion annually (IEG, n.d.).  Figure 8: Comparing required annual financing for electricity infrastructure  in Africa with current financing  Source: Africa Progress Panel, 2015; IEG, n.d.; World Bank Group, 2012.  It is unlikely that the international financial institutions will be able to solve this  financing challenge alone. Consider that between 2000 and 2014 annual  investments in energy from the World Bank Group were around $1.5 billion  annually, with most of that money going to countries with relatively high levels of  energy access and being invested mainly in improving the quality, reliability, and  efficiency of supply to already connected consumers (IEG, n.d.). Countries with  low levels of electricity access received disproportionately small investments,  attracting only 8 percent of total investment in generation capacity (in terms  increasing GW capacity), 7 percent of investment in connections, and 3 percent  of T&D network investments. World Bank projects lasted around nine years on  average. Unless something changes on this front, countries will only receive a  little over two project cycles before 2030, meaning that energy access goals are  unlikely to be met (IEG, n.d.).  The possibilities for official development assistance (ODA) are expected to be  similarly limited. ODA has stagnated since 2011, and while estimates for  financing Africa’s infrastructure needs are estimated at around $93 billion, total  aid to the continent is about half that, with only around $18 billion being available  for infrastructure investment (Africa Progress Panel, 2015).  Despite these challenges, however, the financing problem for energy  infrastructure may well be surmountable. African domestic taxes are thought to  be able to cover about half the financing gap for electricity infrastructure. On top  of this, Africa is estimated to spend about $21 billion on poorly targeted fossil-fuel  subsidies every year (though most of this is dominated by spending in North  Africa, with South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola being the only sub-Saharan  countries paying significant subsidies (IEA, 2011)). The continent is also  estimated to lose around $69 billion annually through illicit financial flows.  Finally, while holding out hope for ODA might be a limited option, it should be  noted that if rich countries met their longstanding goal of contributing 0.7 percent  of GDP to ODA, this would free up an estimated $178 billion in extra financing for  Africa (Africa Progress Panel, 2015).  Given these conditions, the challenge of mobilizing finance for investments in  energy infrastructure is believed to be one of the principal barriers to achieving  universal energy access (Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016). Solving this problem will  likely require using public finances to leverage private finance and generating  policies that create a conducive environment for private investment (Africa  Progress Panel, 2015; Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016). Important channels for  public expenditure will be investments in increasing the efficiency of the grid  (Eberhard et al., 2008) and subsidizing last-mile connections and basic electricity  consumption (Bhattacharyya, 2015; Bhattacharyya & Palit, 2016; Deshmukh et  al., 2013). Policies will need to focus on reducing taxes, tariffs, and import costs  on renewable energy components, supporting the creation of supply chains for  distributed renewable energy technology, and reducing uncertainty around the  expansion of the grid (see below).  On top of financial support, there is a need to increase access to credit (to both  consumers and local entrepreneurs) through efforts at financial inclusion and  increase the periods over which loans can be paid back (Africa Progress Panel,  2015; Turman-Bryant et al., 2015). Efforts in this regard should pay particular  attention to the new financing possibilities being created as a result of new  technologies such as cellphones and mobile money (Alstone et al., 2015).   7. CONCLUSIONS AND WAYS  FORWARD  With a clear sense of the nature of energy poverty, and the opportunities for  improving energy access via different technologies and approaches, the report  moves to consider the important ways forward for energy policy in countries with  low levels of energy access. Overall the emphasis should fall on (1) leveraging  financing, (2) reforming institutions, (3) addressing the challenge of solid  biomass, (4) making explicit plans for grid expansion and distributed energy  integration, (5) balancing different generation technologies and approaches to  access, (6) supporting the whole supply chain across generation technologies,  and (7) placing efforts at electrification within broader development strategies.  FOCUS ON THE FINANCING  Financing presents a fundamental challenge for addressing energy poverty in  sub-Saharan Africa. Public finance will not be able to cover these costs and thus  it is imperative that public finances, along with donor and non-governmental  support, be dedicated towards efforts that leverage private finance in the sector.  At the same time, it is imperative that opportunities for increasing public finance  must be pursued by reducing wasteful and regressive expenditures and  addressing illicit financial flows. Public and donor support should go toward  reducing taxes, tariffs, and import costs on renewable energy components;  undertaking resource assessments; subsidizing basic electricity allowances and  connection fees; and creating and supporting institutions focused on promoting  learning around new technologies.  To help promote investment in technologies that increase energy access, it will  be important to develop policies that reduce risk for private investors, such as  making grid expansion plans transparent, and to create institutes to train the  relevant technicians. Finally, there is a need to promote financial inclusion and  increase access to credit for both potential consumers and local entrepreneurs.  Despite these opportunities for improving financing, in very low-income countries  it will likely be exceptionally challenging to find the finances to ensure that lowincome  groups can gain access to electricity and shift their cooking to improved  cookstoves. Appreciating the scale of this challenge is central to generating  realistic efforts to tackle it.  81 Addressing energy poverty  FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONS  Recent advances in renewable technologies have created new possibilities to  advance energy access at a rate and cost that would not be possible if grid  expansion was the only option available. Important as such advances are,  however, they create a risk that advocates will focus solely on the technology  and overlook the importance of the institutional context in which that technology  is being delivered. In particular, there is a risk of believing that distributed  technologies can simply be provided by the private sector and that challenges  associated with unresponsive and corrupt utilities are no longer an issue.  To reduce this risk, it is worth keeping in mind that distributed energy  technologies are not all new and neither are efforts at improving energy access  (Agbemabiese et al., 2012; Sokona et al., 2012). For example, straightforward  technologies such as windmills have long been promoted in Africa as a means to  provide power for irrigation without resounding success (Sokona et al., 2012).  Likewise, diesel generators have long been able to provide electricity at prices  comparable with what is currently possible using solely PV systems  (Bhattacharyya, 2015) and with much lower up-front costs (World Bank & IEA,  2015), and yet the private sector has not simply capitalized on the latent demand  and provided electricity via mini-grids.  To this end, the literature on energy access repeatedly observes how “weak  institutional structures and organizational systems contribute to the poor  performance of projects.… economically viable projects can fail simply because  of an inadequate appreciation of the importance of appropriate organisational  structures and institutional arrangements. Past experiences also show that a  large number of off-grid electrification projects have had limited success…  because of the disproportionate focus on technical installation without adequate  attention to the long-term sustainability of the projects” (TERI-GNESD, 2014, p.  26). As mentioned above, “no electrification project has ever succeeded without  significant government backing and strong political will” (Schillebeeck et al.,  2012, p. 7), and achieving countrywide rural electrification through the efforts of  small-scale private companies alone is impossible (Mostert, 2008, p. 12). As  such, policy and regulatory environments will matter, as will financial support to  enable supply chains and cover subsidies. The public sector will therefore remain  a crucial part of this process, with the utility likely playing a central role.  There is, therefore, an absolute need to maintain core advocacy work on creating  public energy institutions that are responsive and accountable. It would be an  error, for example, to assume that the private sector can resolve the challenge of  energy access and that debates over the privatization of state utilities can now be  neglected. If this occurs, the ongoing failure of power sector reform to benefit the  poor is likely to continue (Prasad & Visagie, 2006). Further, given the role of  subsidies and the scale of tenders that will likely be involved in increasing energy   access, the scope for misuse of funds is significant. Given that utilities are  already cited as sites of patronage in Africa, the focus on energy access could  well result in a greater need to ensure institutional accountability.  A note of caution on this front is that the political and economic dynamics  shaping institutional responsiveness might be more complex than is often  portrayed in the literature on good governance and institutions. For example,  efforts that have sought to explain energy access by looking at governance  metrics and corruption indicators have been found to lack any power when it  comes to explaining electrification rates across countries (Wolfram et al., 2012).  Such findings mirror a larger trend in the development literature toward  questioning the relationship between both democracy and governance, and  human development outcomes (Nelson, 2007; Ross, 2006; Truex, 2015).  Findings such as these point to the need for institutional reforms to go beyond  cookie-cutter approaches to improving governance and engage with nuanced  accounts of power and political economy analysis when seeking to drive  improved institutional responsiveness. See Text Box 6 for an example of how  these complex processes play out.  DO NOT NEGLECT TRADITIONAL FUELS  Although electricity is a unique source of energy that creates unique  opportunities for improving people’s standard of living, the empirical evidence is  clear: use of solid fuels will remain prevalent regardless of whether households  are connected to electricity and regardless of whether they are connected via the  grid or distributed energy sources. The use of biomass is actually expected to  increase, not decrease, in sub-Saharan Africa (Malla & Timilsina, 2014). Since as  much as 90 percent of household energy needs come from cooking and heating  (Bhattacharyya, 2012), any serious policy on energy poverty needs to dedicate  significant effort to ensuring that such needs can be met safely and sustainably.  Policies must account for managing the use and collection of solid biomass  rather than simply trying to replace such fuels and ignoring the conditions of their  use. To this end the challenges and opportunities around promoting petroleum-based  fuels, such as kerosene and LPG, need to be weighed against the  challenges and opportunities of meeting energy needs through solid biomass  fuels such as fuelwood and charcoal.  In terms of charcoal and fuelwood, policies need to focus on creating standards  for, and ensuring access to, improved cookstoves. While the creation of the  Global Alliance on Clean Cookstoves represents important progress on this front,  given the scale of the challenge of energy poverty, it is clear that still more needs  to be done (Bhattacharyya, 2012). Efforts in this respect include removing taxes  and duties on imported cookstove technologies, raising awareness about the  83 Addressing energy poverty  benefits of using improved cookstoves, creating access to capital for private-sector  cookstove development and purchase, and ensuring that likely users of  improved cookstoves are engaged throughout the design, manufacture, and  retail process to ensure that cookstoves are culturally appropriate and support  local poverty alleviation efforts (Lambe et al., 2015). On top of such actions, as  with electricity access, efforts around cookstoves need to be supported by the  larger infrastructural context so that, for example, roads exist to allow for stoves  to be distributed and grid electricity is cheap and sustainable to allow for stoves  to be manufactured affordably (Agbemabiese et al., 2012).  In addition to promoting improved cookstoves, efforts should be directed toward  encouraging the appropriate drying and storage of fuelwood as well as the  soaking of grains to reduce cooking times (Modi et al., 2006). Finally, policy  needs to focus on creating the conditions for the sustainable harvesting of fuels.  To this end, much can be done to improve efficiency of charcoal kilns (Bailis et  al., 2005). Likewise community management of forests and acknowledgment of  the importance of fuelwood and charcoal production as forms of employment will  be central to ensuring sustainability and poverty reduction. Calls for biomass  collection to be made illegal should be resisted, as this tends only to result in  elicit transactions that are likely to undermine sustainable management (Clancy,  2006). Supply chains for both biomass fuels and cookstoves should be made  more equal and less exploitative. Policy could also play a role in increasing  access to solid fuels by creating fuel depots, which can reduce drudgery, lower  costs, and ensure the sustainable supply of solid biomass (Modi et al., 2006).  Focusing on biomass fuels does not mean excluding attention to improved,  petroleum-based fuels or the uptake of electricity for cooking. The push for clean  cookstoves is not an end in itself, but rather an important interim measure that  can improve health, reduce drudgery, maintain access to forest services, and  mitigate the emission of greenhouse gasses as well as other pollutants, while  access to modern fuels is achieved. It is thus also important to promote the use  of modern fuels; encourage the use of, and create finance for, low-cost  appliances; address bottlenecks in the supply chain of modern fuels; ensure that  fuels are available in small quantities; and ensure that transport infrastructure is  in place to support supply chains (Modi et al., 2006). A focus on education,  especially among women, is also a key way to ensure that households’ fuel use  is rational and not simply determined by the low opportunity cost of women’s  time. In addition, countries need to carefully weigh their support for fossil-fuel  subsidies; they may have been effective in driving the uptake of improved fuels,  but they are highly inefficient and regressive owing to problems with targeting  and leakage.  Finally, complementary actions can be taken to reduce the risks associated with  kerosene, including setting standards that prevent it from being resold in drink  containers, dying kerosene a color so that it does not look like water, and using   childproof caps on containers, which has been shown to significantly reduce  unintentional poisoning32 (Meyer et al., 2007; Tshiamo, 2009). Some of the risks  associated with energy poverty, such as fire risk, are located in larger social  contexts associated with substance abuse, land tenure, and urban planning  (Morrissey & Taylor, 2006). In South Africa, for example, despite improvements  in both energy access and the availability of spill-proof kerosene stoves, the  number of informal settlement fires has continued to rise (Kimemia et al., 2014).  Efforts to address energy poverty therefore need to be rationally located within a  larger policy environment that addresses these larger developmental challenges  as well.  ADDRESS UNCERTAINTY AROUND GRID  EXPANSION  Debates about the merits of centralized, on-grid approaches versus distributed  energy technologies for addressing energy poverty are overstated. Both  strategies will need to be deployed simultaneously. Electricity will best be  introduced to most rural households through distributed technologies, but this will  likely be a temporary solution. The eventual goal should be grid expansion, which  will achieve the lowest cost of electricity for any household and allow for high  rates of renewable energy penetration (see Text Box 3).  As a result, it is essential that plans for grid rollout are transparent and that the  government sticks to those plans. This sort of certainty will be necessary for the  private sector to invest in distributed energy technology. Given that plans for grid  rollout can involve time scales of 25 years (Eberhard et al., 2008), staying the  course on policies made today will involve resisting intense political pressure to  change those plans and connect certain constituencies. To this end, an effective  means for planning the rollout of the grid is on the basis of least-cost. Also  needed are policies that detail what will happen when grid expansion meets  privately owned, distributed generation projects that have not yet recovered their  costs and generated a return on capital.  MIX TECHNOLOGIES FOR ACCESS  In balancing expansion of the grid with distributed energy technologies, as well  as identifying roles for the state, the private sector, and community-led efforts,  every country context will be unique. This context will depend on factors such as  32 Certain graphics, such as the skull and crossbones on kerosene containers, have actually been  discouraged by the US National Committee for Injury Prevention and Control because they  have been shown to attract children rather than deter them (Meyer et al., 2007).  85 Addressing energy poverty  the size of the economy, the distribution of the population (and the distribution of  wealth across the population), the nature of the terrain, the availability of different  energy sources and fuels, and the current quality of infrastructure. Despite such  variation, in general, decisions on technologies should include the following  principles:  1. Policies should be in place to connect “under the grid” populations and be  complemented by polices to ensure that there is sufficient generation  capacity to meet the extra demand. Such policies need to consider the  particular challenges faced by the urban poor; economic trickle-down will not  automatically meet these groups’ needs (Clancy, 2006), especially when  connection problems stem from their interaction with compromised access to  serviceable land.  2. Income density will be an important guide to determining where grid  expansion should be a priority. The grid should be expanded to areas where  its considerable economies of scale can be exploited.  3. Where incomes densities are relatively high yet population centers are  remote, mini-grids will be the best solution. They will provide the cheapest  form of energy with the additional possibility of being scaled up to meet future  growth in demand.  4. Where remote populations are scattered into small homesteads, SHSs will  likely be the best choice.  5. Among very poor households, solar appliances might be the best option.  Policies to support this should focus on awareness raising, the removal of  taxes and tariffs on solar appliances, and creation of product quality  verification standards (Turman-Bryant et al., 2015).  6. Plans to expand energy access through biodigesters should be modest given  the barriers experienced in other countries when it comes to effectively  integrating them into household energy consumption.  Efforts at grid expansion are likely best undertaken by a centralized state body  owing to the fact that the grid represents an almost prefect monopoly. Beyond  grid expansion, a mix of private and public approaches can productively generate  and sell electricity. Likewise, the provision of distributed energy technology can  take place through a variety of hybrid arrangements involving the state and the  private sector (Mostert, 2008). Establishing a dedicated government department,  focused on increasing energy access, within the utility has proven useful in cases  where access to electricity has been successfully expanded33 (Eberhard et al.,  2008). In all cases, policies aimed at achieving energy access should include  33 It should be noted that having such a dedicated body does not always result in improved energy  access.   provisions for flexibility so that it is possible to learn from successes and amend  policies as new problems arise. The process by which Africa is electrified will not  parallel experiences from other countries. With few blueprints for best practices,  learning must be a central feature of policy.  SUPPORT THE WHOLE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY  SUPPLY CHAIN (NOT JUST UP-FRONT COSTS)  As mentioned, the state and the utility will likely matter a great deal in efforts to  increase energy access and address energy poverty—even for distributed  energy technologies. Policies should focus not only on addressing challenges  related to the costs of generation, storage, and distribution, but also on the entire  supply chain. This will include creating institutions that train technicians,  installers, construction staff, economists, and engineers (Modi et al., 2006;  Mostert, 2008). It will require ensuring that parts for servicing and replacement  are available and affordable, undertaking resource assessments, and creating  institutions for financing for both entrepreneurs and consumers. Without such  conditions in place, projects are likely to prove unsustainable (Terrapon-Pfaff et  al., 2014) and the subsidies covering initial capital costs could well be wasted as  projects fail or are abandoned.  Because distributed renewable energy technologies are new, the state will also  play an important role in overcoming first-generation technology barriers.  Activities will include providing data and promoting learning about the creation of  effective supply chains and viable business models (Bhattacharyya & Palit,  2016).  PLACE ELECTRICITY ACCESS WITHIN THE  BROADER CONTEXT OF DEVELOPMENT  Although access to abundant energy is clearly a precondition for the levels of  economic productivity and well-being experienced in industrial and post-industrial  economies, simply providing households with electricity is unlikely, by itself, to  drive the large development outcomes that are possible. As such, while  improving electricity access is an important development imperative in and of  itself, it must be conceived of within a broader development agenda that focuses  on the provision of other infrastructure such as roads, markets, and sanitation,  and the availability of other services such as credit, education, health, and  policing. In this respect it will be important to integrate energy poverty alleviation  into efforts to close the energy gap in sub-Saharan Africa. Such a large-scale  integration of development efforts is challenging because it will involve many  87 Addressing energy poverty  different government departments and ministries, but this integrated planning is  likely to be necessary to realize the development opportunities made possible by  electrification.

RA-2015-7.txt,"The Land Sector and Country Commitments to Global Climate Action: A Rainforest Alliance Assessment of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)   December 2015 Authors: Kassy Holmes Alex Ramage This report was made possible due to the generous support of the SEM Charitable Trust.  The Land Sector and Country Commitments to Global Climate Action: A Rainforest Alliance Assessment of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs)  INTRODUCTION Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) are commitments that have been submitted by the member states of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in advance of the 21st session of the Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris. They are the foundation of what will become a new, global agreement to advance international action on climate change. Each INDC details the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission commitments each country aims to achieve, along with adaptation strategies and other relevant information. The Rainforest Alliance, as an organization focused on transforming land-use practices and building sustainable livelihoods for communities reliant on forests and agriculture, is particularly interested in assessing the extent to which the INDCs account for reducing emissions caused by the land sector and improving the adaptive capacity of stakeholders involved in this sector. This paper analyzes how the land sector is being represented within a select group of INDCs. It is a summary of priority thematic issues related to agriculture, forestry, other land uses, and climate change. It is not an exhaustive analysis of each country's submission or of all INDCs. The issue areas of emphasis look at how the INDC may: a) advance sustainable forestry strategies (including REDD+), b) promote Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices that reduce deforestation,  c) strive to increase yields and incomes, and d) help vulnerable communities adapt to climate change. To that end, this paper focuses on the INDCs of forested countries in the tropics and neo-tropics, including those with strong agricultural industries, along with some other developed or emerging market countries whose commitments help determine the pace and depth of change within the land sector worldwide. These include: Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, European Union, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Liberia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia, Uganda, United States, and Vietnam. This analysis is supplemented with examples from the Rainforest Alliance and partners working to advance climate change action within the land sector; these examples highlight successes and lessons learned that can be applied globally. OVERVIEW OF INDCS AND LAND SECTOR Land sector emissions encompass those generated by deforestation, agriculture, forestry, and other land use. Within the INDCs, some countries consider the agriculture sector to be separate from what is called the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector, while others use the term Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) to refer to both LULUCF and agriculture. The terms AFOLU and LULUCF are therefore both used herein, meaning ""the land sector"".    AFOLU contributes up to 24 percent of GHG emissions worldwide. It is the second largest source of emissions after energy and accounts for more than the emissions caused by transport and buildings combined.1 In some countries, this percentage is even higher: AFOLU accounts for 75 percent of emissions in Kenya and almost 80 percent in Indonesia.2 As of December 4, 2015, 157 INDCs have been submitted. These collectively represent 184 countries and almost 98 percent of global emissions, as measured in 2010.3 According to the UN, ""most Parties [have] included emissions and removals from LULUCF"".4 This fact, in itself, is a signal of progress; however, the extent to which each submission elaborates on how emission reductions within the land sector will be achieved, and the inclusion of specific targets and plans for monitoring and evaluation, vary significantly. One broad concern is that the ambition of countries' mitigation efforts is not always clear, because the `Business As Usual' projections provided are often not explained in the INDCs. The United States' INDC does not specify how emissions within the AFOLU sector are to be reduced (nor does it include detailed actions for energy, industry and other sectors). While a degree of flexibility within mitigation strategies is understandable, a greater level of specificity would be helpful for understanding how progress will be made towards the overall US target of 26-28 percent (below 2005 levels) by 2025. The European Union's INDC excludes LULUCF from its mitigation framework, citing unexplained ""technical conditions"".5 It does pledge to establish policy that  will include LULUCF within the framework by 2020, but this leaves a concerning range of important issues unclear, including whether LULUCF emissions and removals are to be included in the base year, and if so how. While many of the INDCs contain commitments which will make a significant contribution towards reducing global warming to the <2°C target, there are many that do not demonstrate the ambition necessary to avert a global climate crisis. For example, the 2030 targets of Russia and Japan are achievable with no substantive change in policies, and appear to use a high-baseline in 1990 to avoid meaningful reductions from more recent benchmarks. For industrialized G8 countries to propose commitments that require no additional political effort contravenes the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol. 6 7 FORESTS Forests are vital to our planet. They are home to half of the world's plant and animal species, provide critical ecosystem services, and absorb billions of tons of carbon every year.8 Through reforestation programs and the protection of forest stocks, there is further opportunity to greatly increase the quantity of carbon absorbed and stored in trees. Given their importance, forests must be at the center of any international agreement in Paris, yet there is wide variation in the detail given to both accounting and action on forestry across the INDCs.   Indonesia is the world's fifth-highest emitting country, has the third largest tropical rainforest and ranks second to Brazil for tropical deforestation. Half of Sumatra's forest cover was lost between 1985 and 2008. Loss of peatland and LULUCF is responsible for 79 percent of Indonesia's total GHG emissions.9 Despite these figures, there is no explanation within the Indonesian INDC of how the country intends to make their emission reductions, or which sectors will be targeted. An earlier version of Indonesia's INDC included plans to protect 12.7 million hectares of forest areas ""for social forestry, ecosystem restoration, conservation and sustainable use"".10 However, this level of detail is missing from the final INDC. Where deforestation accounts for the greatest share of national emissions, as in Indonesia, the absence of specific actions or strategies to address land-sector emissions is troubling. Alongside measures to decrease and eliminate deforestation, some INDCs detail national plans to actually expand forest cover to reduce net emissions. Ecuador's INDC contains a commitment to restore 500,000 additional hectares annually until 2017 and increase this total by 100,000 hectares per year until 2025.11 Ghana also includes a commitment to reforestation and the afforestation of degraded lands, giving an unconditional commitment of 10,000 hectares of annual reforestation/afforestation.12 This commitment would double with sufficient international financial support. China's INDC pledges an increase in forest carbon stocks of 4.5 billion cubic meters, implying an increase in forest cover of 50-100 million hectares, creating a roughly 1-gigaton carbon sink. This is a heartening demonstration of commitment from the world's largest GHG emitter, but it will be important that land chosen for reforestation takes into account the livelihoods of local people and supports ecosystem conservation and expansion, rather than monoculture plantations.13 The INDC for China remains ambiguous on two fronts: the year when China's CO2 emissions will peak and begin to fall, and whether the country's targets include emissions from land use and forestry. In a country with such a large population, and with almost twice the CO2 emissions of the United States, this lack of transparency is concerning. In contrast, other INDCs include definitive commitments on deforestation, reforestation and the conservation of ecosystems. Mexico's INDC includes a commitment to ""reach a rate of 0% deforestation by the year 2030"" and to ""reforest high, medium and low watersheds with special attention to riparian zones... taking into account native species in the area"". 14 15 This level of detail, with accompanying figures and  specific percentages, represents the transparency and ambition in planned action that is highly constructive when trying to reach an international agreement, but lacking from many of the INDCs. Some INDCs include forest cover expansion as a national objective, but lack detail on how and when these goals will be accomplished. Kenya's INDC states the country will ""make progress towards achieving a tree cover of at least 10% of the land area of Kenya"".16 India's INDC similarly declares the country's long-term goal to expand forest cover to ""33% of its geographical area... eventually"".17 While an open-ended commitment is better than none at all, it would be advantageous to enter the negotiations with a detailed picture of how and when each country intends to meet its objectives. The ecosystem services forests provide - including water, soil and air quality, carbon sequestration, habitats for communities and species, and buffering from natural disasters ­ are important to human life and must be protected against climate change impacts. While there are some examples of countries which have included forests as part of their adaptation plans (as seen below), it is clear that forests are evaluated more prominently in terms of mitigation. · Peru commits to promoting landscape approaches through its National Adaptation Plan that ""increase forests' resilience to climate change, and reduce vulnerability of local populations"". Leuser rain forest, Indonesia Photo: Danurfan Indie   · Colombia commits to increasing ""2.5 million hectares in coverage of newly-protected areas in the National System of Protected Areas, in coordination with local and regional stakeholders"". 19 · Liberia mentions planned actions related to adaptation and forestry including reforestation, strengthening the participation of local communities in forest conservation activities and safeguarding biodiversity. 20 · Costa Rica aims to advance ecosystem-based adaptation practices that include increasing forest coverage by 60 percent and exploring ""synergies between adaptation practices and the reduction of emissions through avoided deforestation"". 21 · Mexico's INDC also stresses the importance of protecting forests as part of an ecosystem-based adaptation strategy. 22 Sustainable forest management that emphasizes improved resilience is critical, not only in the tropics, but in North America, where pine bark beetles, whose proliferation is due to warmer temperatures linked to climate change, impacted ""more than 4 million acres since the first signs of outbreak in 1996"" in Northern Colorado and South Eastern Wyoming alone.23 Community engagement in silvicultural forest management can drastically reduce the spread of these pests, and demonstrates the inextricable link between climate change mitigation and adaptation in the forest sector. 24 Communities whose livelihoods depend on forests, and indigenous communities in particular, must also be included in climate change strategies and engaged in resilience and capacity-building efforts. This is particularly critical given the vital role such stakeholders maintain as forest stewards. In the Amazon alone, it is estimated that over half of the carbon stored in the forest is within indigenous territories and protected natural areas and only 1.9% of the deforestation in the Amazon occurs inside land managed by indigenous communities.25 While the INDCs of some countries such as Peru, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam and Costa Rica note the importance of encouraging the participation of indigenous organizations and respecting the rights of traditional forest communities, many INDCs do not emphasize the need to include indigenous communities in advancing sustainable community forestry practices, REDD+ or forest conservation. As the GuateCarbon Project (box) demonstrates, when those who live and depend on forests manage them sustainably, significant benefits accrue not just for those communities but for forest conservation and climate change mitigation efforts worldwide.  Guatemala: Landscape Level REDD+ and the GuateCarbon Project Based in the Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR), GuateCarbon is a forest carbon project that demonstrates the success of community-based forest concessions on government land and could provide a valuable example to other countries seeking to address deforestation. The project is a collaborative partnership, managed jointly by the Association of Forest Communities of Petén (ACOFOP) and Guatemala's National Council of Protected Areas (CONAP), with technical assistance provided by the Rainforest Alliance and the Wildlife Conservation Society. By implementing sustainable forest management practices as embodied by the Forest Stewardship Council® standards and conservation practices to protect forest carbon stock reserves, the concessions aim to generate carbon credits that will be verified against the Verified Carbon Standard and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity standard. ""The additional revenue will help us improve forest management and conduct surveillance to stop illegal logging and control forest fires,"" says Arturo Sánchez, a member of the Árbol Verde community forest concession. ""We will also be able to conduct ongoing monitoring to assess forest cover and examine the impacts of our work."" The project is expected to result in 36.9 million metric tons of CO2e in avoided emissions over the course of its 30 year lifetime. As a result of implementing sustainable forest practices, community-managed forests in the 700,000-hectare project area have a deforestation rate 20 times less than surrounding areas. Furthermore, this project is feeding into Guatemala's emerging REDD+ strategy, pointing to the important role that large, landscape-level forest carbon projects can play in in shaping national REDD+ strategies.   REDD+ Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus additional measures (REDD+), such as forest conservation and sustainable forest management, is an approach supported by the United Nations to create a financial value for the carbon stored in forests. REDD+ policies and measures seek to provide incentives for tropical forest countries to maintain and enhance forest resources for the environmental services they offer. REDD+ has been identified as one of the more cost-effective ways to reduce global emissions, as preventing deforestation achieves impacts in a very short period of time. 26 Many tropical and sub-tropical forested countries reference REDD+ within their INDCs, including Brazil, Colombia, India, and Indonesia. It is widely seen as an important tool in the mitigation of climate change, but its prominence and detail within the INDCs varies. Regarding REDD, Peru cites the need to ""reinforce support for this mechanism under the new agreement"".27 Guatemala's INDC states it will utilize a REDD+ strategy as a key incentive for reducing emissions within the LULUCF sector, with the aim of developing a National Emissions Reduction Program.28 Ghana's INDC focuses its land sector emission reductions almost entirely on REDD+, stating that its five named actions fall under the promotion of ""sustainable utilization of forest resources through REDD+"".29 These actions include annual reforestation/afforestation of 10,000 ha of degraded lands and a 45 percent emission reduction from cocoa landscapes, coupled with efforts to increase the incomes of 20,000 cocoa farmers by ""doubling the average yield per hectare"". 30 The REDD+ safeguards outlined in the Cancun Agreement (2010) underscore respect for the interests and rights of indigenous communities and observance of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) in REDD+ programs and projects. Costa Rica's INDC is an example that explicitly states that all climate policies and actions must have full compliance with the Cancun Safeguards and abide by the rules of FPIC.31 It will be important to the integrity and longevity of REDD+ that these rules and guidelines are followed and updated as necessary. REDD+ exemplifies a trend inherent to the INDCs: many of the most transformative changes are contingent on the agreement of a financial distribution mechanism between mature industrialized economies and the world's developing nations. This is noted in Uganda's INDC, which states that the country's achievement target in the forestry sector ""assumes continuation of existing supported measures in the sector and in particular financial flows through the implementation of REDD+.""32 Brazil similarly asserts that ""...  the implementation of REDD+ activities and the permanence of results achieved require the provision, on a continuous basis, of adequate and predictable resultsbased payments in accordance with the relevant COP decisions.""33 There is uncertainty not only concerning the adequacy and sustainability of funding sources for REDD+, but also on how emission reductions will be compensated and toward which country's INDC these emissions reductions will count. Reaching agreement on these issues that form the basis of a successful REDD+ mechanism is one of the primary challenges for the Paris summit. While there are examples of countries that include REDD+ within the INDCs, such as those above, some countries like Ecuador, Kenya, and the United States do not mention it at all. Considering how much tropical forest countries have invested over nearly ten years of preparing for REDD+, it's disconcerting that there aren't more INDCs explicitly calling for REDD+ as a principle mitigation action.    Ghana: A landscape approach to REDD+ in the cocoa growing region Ghana is the world's second largest producer of cocoa, with the majority of its harvest coming from the west of the country. Cocoa production is one of the country's leading causes of deforestation, and smallholder farmers are also experiencing the effects of climate change, with a heightened dry season and unpredictable weather patterns. Cocoa farmers must therefore be included in efforts to reduce deforestation and improve the resilience of cocoa supply chains to a changing climate. Rainforest Alliance is working to advance this goal through an innovative REDD+ agroforestry project implemented at a landscape-level across 36,000ha in the Juabeso-Bia region of Western Ghana. Through certification against the Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) standards, training and capacity building, farmers are implementing practices that increase on-farm carbon storage, reduce GHG emissions and enhance productivity. Farmers are now gaining the skills needed to better manage risk within their farms and build resilience. They are also implementing measures to increase on-farm carbon storage through reforestation with the aim of ultimately generating REDD carbon credits. Over 2,000 farmers are engaged in the project which is expected to contribute 140,000 tonnes of CO2e sequestration over 20 years. The project's ultimate goal is to replicate this model in other biodiversity hotspots in the country where cocoa is grown.  AGRICULTURE Several INDCs recognize agriculture as a key source of emissions, though the level of detail on how such emissions will be reduced is inconsistent. Some key examples of countries that explicitly refer to agriculture include the following. · Kenya's INDC states the country will promote and implement Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) in line with the country's highly impressive National CSA Framework, which includes commitments such as rehabilitating ""at least 20 percent of degraded land... by 2030"". 34 35 · Costa Rica asserts that it is ""looking earnestly into emission reduction through different measures... while increasing productivity and the range of environmental services provided by agriculture and livestock"".36 To that end, the country is advancing Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA) within the coffee sector, as well as developing NAMA proposals for livestock and biomass, among other initiatives. · Vietnam's INDC commits the country to reducing emissions associated with agriculture through CSA and improved production processes and technologies that, for example, allow farmers to use waste as feed and fertilizers. 37 · Brazil's INDC commits to strengthening the Low Carbon Emission Agriculture Program (ABC) as ""the main strategy for sustainable agriculture development"", through the restoration of ""an additional 15 million hectares of degraded pasturelands by 2030"" and enhancement of ""5 million hectares of integrated cropland-livestock-forestry systems (ICLFS) by 2030"". 38 In most INDCs the actions to reduce GHGs associated with agriculture are not detailed or prominently expressed. This is concerning given the fact that although total AFOLU emissions have decreased within the past decade, GHGs generated through crop and livestock production have increased, making agriculture the main GHG source in the AFOLU sector.39 As an example, New Zealand is a developed country where agriculture constitutes around half of GHG emissions. Despite the large amount of GHGs generated by the agricultural sector, New Zealand's government has stated that it is unlikely that agricultural emissions will be specifically targeted for reductions in its INDC.40 Argentina's agricultural emissions, largely from cattle-ranching, are actually set to increase by 35 percent over the next 15 years, and it will continue to account for a third of total emissions.41 If all countries demonstrated    a similar lack of ambition within their dominant emission sectors, the world would be facing the prospect of global warming in excess of 3-4°C­ enough to raise sea levels by several meters and bring devastating droughts to much of Earth's arable land. 42 43 Agriculture is often mentioned in connection with adaptation within the INDCs. As reported by the UN, the key priority areas for adaptation listed within the INDCs are water, agriculture, and health.45 In fact, adaptation strategies within agriculture seem to be some of the more detailed of the INDCs and include implementing sustainable agriculture programs, integrating pest management, incorporating crops that are more resilient to heat, drought and diseases, expanding use of agricultural calendars, executing sustainable livestock management, and reducing erosion. 46 · Ecuador's INDC speaks to the need for advancing CSA, through promoting agroforestry and silvopastoral practices, the use of technology and data, and capacity-building and knowledge-sharing to improve the resilience of farmers and agricultural systems.47 · Peru also commits to ""reducing the negative impact of climate change on agrarian activity (agriculture, livestock, and forestry)."" 48 · Costa Rica emphasizes the importance of increasing the resilience of agricultural production, particularly through community-based adaptation approaches. 49 · Colombia specifies goals and targets, something that is often lacking from the INDCs. Colombia's INDC expresses an ambition that ""10 subsectors of the agricultural sector such as rice, coffee, livestock and silvopastoral, [will gain] improved capabilities to adapt appropriately to climate change and variability""; and it commits to ""1 million producers [receiving] agro-climatic information to facilitate decision-making in agricultural activities"". 50 · India's National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture ""focuses on new technologies and practices in cultivation, [and] genotypes of crops that have enhanced CO2 fixation potential, which are less water consuming and more climate resilient. India has developed 580 district-level contingency plans based on early warning systems and other weather forecasting systems."" Gender and Climate Change Adaptation Across the globe, women are engaged in agriculture, forestry and other livelihood activities that are equally affected by climate change, yet their unequal access to education and resources (natural and economic) can render them more vulnerable to climate impacts than men. Women make up 50 percent or more of the agricultural workforce in some countries, and have knowledge and skills that can benefit climate adaptation and mitigation. If given access to the same production resources as men, it is projected that women could increase their farm yields by 20 to 30 percent. This would boost overall agricultural output by up to four percent and reduce the global poverty rate by up to 17 percent. 44 We encourage the adoption of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) and provide women with training on how to meet the requirements of Sustainable Agriculture Network (SAN) and Rainforest Alliance certification. This aims to bring environmental sustainability while creating a safe and equitable working environment for women, by protecting their rights and strictly prohibiting discrimination and forced labor. Furthermore, it states that men and women must have equal training opportunities and receive equivalent compensation when completing the same type of work. · Liberia's INDC includes the promotion of drought-resistant /flood-tolerant crop species"", the development of climate resilient crop/agroforestry diversification, the creation of a climate adaptation knowledge and experience-sharing platform, and the establishment of a ""gene bank of climate-resilient varieties of indigenous food crops"". Agriculture offers a mixed picture across the INDCs. There are some highly encouraging adaptation strategies that demonstrate that many countries across the world are taking on the crucial challenge of building resilience in food production. However, agriculture alone represents 13 percent of global emissions, and the INDCs do not contain enough detail on the mitigation strategies that will be implemented to address this challenge.53 Except for some notable exceptions, including Costa Rica, Kenya, and Ecuador, CSA does not feature in the INDCs to the extent that it will be required throughout the world in the coming years. In addition to the need to reduce GHGs within the sector, agriculture will be faced with rising production demands with a need for overall food production to increase by an estimated 70 percent by 2050.54 This will require increased production efficiencies along with large yield increases, all of which demand a global shift towards CSA. ACCOUNTING & METHODOLOGY Although is it expected that countries follow the IPCC Good Practice Guidance related to monitoring and accounting for emissions, there is no mandated framework, so countries vary in the methods and approaches used with regards to the land sector. As noted by the UN, ""Many of the INDCs do not provide comprehensive information on the assumptions and methods applied in relation to LULUCF, which presents a major challenge for the quantitative evaluation of the aggregate effect of the INDCs."" 55 Assessing climate change adaptation (i.e. climate resilience or reduced vulnerability) presents another monitoring and accounting challenge within the INDCs: how  do we determine whether a community has `adapted' or is `resilient'? Unlike `hectares of land certified' or `tons of carbon sequestered', there are no stand-alone indicators or metrics for adaptation. Countries will need to design creative ways to address this challenge and to better understand existing methods and approaches in order to ensure that adaptation interventions are indeed improving the adaptive capacity of those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. More broadly, without sufficient oversight and transparency, there is a risk that countries' emissions and deforestation data may be miscounted or misrepresented. The need for the application of standard procedures of measurement is demonstrated by the disparity between AFOLU emissions data being reported by the Indonesian government and the level of deforestation that the wider scientific community estimates in Indonesia over the same period.  Measuring tree to determine carbon sequestration in Ghana   While the Indonesian government claims that national AFOLU emissions have declined since 2003, the scientific community suggests that present trends indicate an annual 20 percent increase in deforestation, and that should this continue, emissions from forestry and other land use could be doubled over the next 15 years. We highlight cases such as these to emphasize the need for globally-united AFOLU policies to tackle land sector emissions. Indonesian deforestation is driven largely by international demand for palm oil and timber, and therefore a global binding agreement that embeds CSA and offers the opportunity to monetize standing forests, if coupled with sufficient political and scientific ambition, could help forested countries like Indonesia become leaders in the fight against global warming. FINANCING As noted previously, many of the actions put forward within the INDCs of developing countries are conditional on substantial international funding. The question remains as to where exactly this funding will come from and how it will be sustained in the long-term to sufficiently meet the requirements of the mitigation and adaptation measures of developing countries. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is an organization established in 2010 by the UNFCCC for the distribution of funding for mitigation and adaptation projects. The UNFCCC has agreed that $100 billion per year will be required for climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries by 2020. The GCF will distribute the large majority of this public and private financing. There is recognition of the Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities: that industrialized countries bear the greater responsibility for climate change, and therefore for supplying the GCF (although there is some disagreement on how developing economies' contributions should increase post-2020). However, with just over $10 billion pledged to the GCF in the five years since it was established, there's little indication that this enormous increase in funding will be forthcoming. It is a concern that an internationally established organization, central to climate change mitigation and adaptation, is making such slow progress in achieving the funding it requires five years after its inception. The GCF has done important preliminary work to establish itself as the vehicle for climate mitigation and adaptation project-funding, but it requires consistent political momentum and commitment in order to achieve the ambitions of its constitution. CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS This paper has looked into the INDCs of nations with the most influence over current and future emissions in the AFOLU sector. A global agreement is what is required, and it is evident that the land sector, responsible for almost a quarter of all emissions, must be considered a central component of it. The INDCs vary in both detail and ambition, however there are encouraging signs from a large number of countries that this traditionally underrepresented portion of global emissions is gaining new traction in both mitigation and  adaptation. Further, it is becoming clear that these outcomes can be achieved together. Agriculture represents in itself one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. The rise in population to almost 10 billion by 2050, alongside the greater food demands that follow increased wealth in the developing world, will require an increase in agricultural yield of 70 percent in the next 35 years. Achieving this growth while making drastic cuts in carbon intensity will demand significant resources and an internationally united campaign to change agricultural practices. Protecting and expanding forests is recognized by many countries, including Mexico, China, and Colombia, as a cost-efficient strategy in the mitigation of global warming. Funding mechanisms such as REDD+, which recognize the value of the carbon stored in the world's forests, can be a means by which forested (and often developing) countries can achieve sustainable economic growth while they and the rest of the world enjoy the benefits of our forest ecosystems, including their capacity for carbon storage. Maintaining old growth forest in regions populated by indigenous communities protects irreplaceable cultural and biological diversity. Any mechanism that inadvertently favors intensive monoculture plantations over these ancient ecosystems must be resisted. However, with the correct regulations in place, forests can be both a stable home for humans and half our planet's species and an indispensable carbon sink. RAINFOREST ALLIANCE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COP21: · Forested countries throughout the world should not overlook adaptation in their forest climate action plans. · China should specify an ambitious timeframe and level at which its emissions will peak and focus its impressive reforestation pledge on the restoration and expansion of natural ecosystems (rather than monoculture forests or plantations). · India and Kenya should develop an ambitious program to achieve their targets for the expansion of forests in a timely manner--and then build on their successes. · We encourage all countries to deliver their forest mitigation and adaptation actions in partnership and collaboration with the indigenous and agricultural communities that live and work on these lands.   · We recommend that Climate-Smart Agriculture practices, which are essential to both mitigation and adaptation, are implemented throughout the world. These increase the yield of land and income for farmers and reduce devastating agricultural expansion. · We highlight the need to empower women through education, refining production practices and diversifying income streams to improve adaptive capacity and equality. · We applaud Ghana, Kenya, Ecuador and Brazil for making specific commitments for the restoration of degraded lands for agriculture and reforestation · New Zealand and Argentina should recognize the opportunity for reductions in agricultural carbon intensity and match the levels of ambition shown by countries such as Costa Rica and Vietnam. · We encourage the international community to establish a consensual model by which REDD+ can provide an adequate economic incentive to forested countries and communities to prevent the logging and land-use change that is causing deforestation across the tropics and neo-tropics. We also encourage countries to implement agricultural programs that maintain ecosystems and sequester carbon. This is reliant on adherence to best practice for FPIC and the Cancun Safeguards, designed to protect local communities and prevent perversions of broader objectives. · We encourage delegates in Paris to agree an international standard for accounting and representing land sector emissions. This is evidently crucial if the international community is to hold nations to any agreement that emerges from the summit. · We urge the international community to come to an agreement on how the Green Climate Fund is to achieve and maintain the level of funding that it needs and to provide further detail on how mitigation and adaptation projects in the developing world can gain access to these funds. AFOLU is one of many overlapping sectors that will require a fundamental shift in global action and approach. Success will rely on unprecedented international collaboration and a shared determination to achieve and build on a meaningful agreement in Paris. Forests and agriculture must be at the center of this change in approach if we are to save the diversity of the planet's cultures and species, adequately feed a growing population, and avoid the worst effects of climate change.

Who is responsible for taking action, and  what actions should they take? How do we deal with  impacts that often fall on those least responsible for  creating the problem? What are our responsibilities  to future generations?  These questions persist despite more than 20 years  of international cooperation and discussion. With  the impacts of climate change already being felt,  it is clear that that we need answers–and action–  more urgently than ever.  While a new international agreement in 2015 offers  a tremendous opportunity to tackle climate change,  we must also ensure it helps tackle, rather than  heighten, other urgent challenges people face, from  food security and housing to decent livelihoods and  adequate transportation. By focusing not on what  separates us but what unites us–the opportunity for  all humans to achieve wellbeing and lead a dignified  life–climate action and equity can go hand in hand.  Building Climate Equity provides just that new perspective.  It draws on successful experiences tackling  climate change while building peoples’ basic capabilities.  It demonstrates that climate action and equity  can be intricately linked and mutually reinforcing.  Focusing on these links between climate action  and capabilities can result in greater consensus  and more ambitious and effective climate outcomes.  This report provides recommendations to  strengthen the synergies between climate action  and equity both in a new 2015 climate agreement  and beyond. While we cannot set aside critical  issues such as responsibility for emissions, a focus  on capabilities can help us build the necessary consensus  to support a strong, durable, and ambitious  international framework.  We hope this report guides the international  community on the design and implementation of  climate action that builds capabilities and achieves  equity. By doing so, we can look forward to a more inclusive,  low-carbon and climate resilient future  for everyone.  FOREWORD  Andrew Steer  President  World Resources Institute  vi   Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 1  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Climate change poses significant and inter-related equity  challenges. As climate impacts increase so too does the urgency  of addressing these equity challenges. This report offers a new  approach to these challenges by linking actions to combat climate  change with broader equity objectives, placing the wellbeing of  people and communities at the core of climate action. Building on  the findings of 30 case studies in 23 countries it demonstrates how  climate policies within countries, including policies directed at both  low-carbon energy development and resilience to climate change  effects, can simultaneously build the capabilities of individuals and  communities. It provides recommendations for how international  institutions and policymakers can support these national level  actions, and the key role that the new international climate  agreement can play in creating transformational climate action by  focusing on equity and capabilities.   For more than two decades, crafting global actions  that all nations find equitable has been a central  challenge for international climate policy. Contentious  debates over how to equitably combat climate  change and how to equitably assess which countries  are most responsible for taking action has slowed  progress toward a global climate agreement.  As climate impacts mount, so does the urgency of  resolving this challenge. Those least responsible  for climate change are often the most vulnerable  to changes in weather patterns, sea level rise, and  other impacts, further exacerbating existing inequities.  Meanwhile, actions—both to address climate  impacts and to reduce emissions—are intertwined  with broader equity issues involving livelihoods,  health, food security, and energy access.  The urgency of the equity challenge is heightened  by recent negotiations for the new international  climate agreement in 2015. Parties have determined  that the agreement must both be “applicable to all  Parties” while remaining “under the Convention,”  raising questions regarding equity that must be  addressed by global leaders if the agreement is to  build consensus and ambition (UNFCCC 2011).  This report offers a new approach to these challenges  by linking actions to combat climate change  with broader equity objectives, placing the wellbeing  of people and communities at the core of  climate action. It expands the narrative for climate  equity to one that is capable of addressing current  and future climate impacts, human development,  and responsibility for emissions, and that can accelerate—  not impede–momentum for climate action.  It demonstrates that climate action and equity are  integrally linked and can be mutually supportive,  and that the 2015 Agreement, in particular, can play  a key role in strengthening those synergies.  A Capabilities Approach to Climate Action  Building Climate Equity proposes that the international  community adopt a capabilities approach as a  means of embedding equity in climate policy.  First formulated in the development arena by economist  Amartya Sen and philosopher Martha Nussbaum  (Sen 1999; Nussbaum 2003), the capabilities  approach emphasizes the role that access to a range  of basic capabilities plays in human wellbeing and  the realization of human rights. These capabilities  include the opportunity to pursue a decent livelihood;  to benefit from sufficient nutrition, transport,  education, housing, physical safety, and security;  and to engage in collective decision-making.  Climate policies—both those reducing emissions  and those adapting and building resilience to  climate impacts—can contribute to protecting and  strengthening these basic capabilities. Such an  approach not only addresses the challenges posed  by climate change but will build equity and in turn  enable greater consensus for climate action.  Climate Policies at Multiple Levels  Climate action and capabilities are linked at multiple,  interdependent levels as shown in Figure 1. This  includes the capabilities of individuals and communities,  such as those involving livelihoods, health, nutrition,  shelter, physical safety, and decision making.  It also includes national capabilities, such as human  development, economic capacity, resilience to climate  impacts including physical security and capacity  to adapt in the face of climate change, as well as  governance capacity and social support structures.  This report examines how a capabilities approach  can be used to guide equitable climate action at the  international, national, and sub-national levels by  focusing on the promotion and enhancement of  capabilities of the most vulnerable and least well off.  This report offers a  new approach to these  challenges by linking  actions to combat climate  change with broader  equity objectives, placing  the wellbeing of people  and communities at the  core of climate action.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 3     The Report in Brief  This report begins by highlighting how climate policies  within countries, including policies directed at  both low-carbon energy development and resilience  to climate change effects, can simultaneously build  the capabilities of individuals and communities.  These policy examples are drawn from 30 case  studies in 23 countries around the world, including  renewable energy, equitable carbon pricing, fossil  fuel subsidy reform, low carbon transportation,  community forestry, and a range of adaptation and  resilience policies. We focus in particular on the  capabilities of the most vulnerable and least well  off because their capabilities are most at risk and in  need of strengthening.  Building on the findings in these case studies, this  report provides recommendations about ways that  international institutions and policymakers can  concretely support the development and implementation  of these types of actions at the national and  sub-national levels.  Next, the report specifically addresses how the 2015  international climate agreement can take account of  and help build capabilities. This approach enhances  the meaning of “respective capabilities” within the  Convention’s principle of “common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities”  (UNFCCC 1992).  A pragmatic and multidimensional understanding  of national capabilities can assist countries in  evaluating the equitability of actions in the 2015  Agreement. However, this report does not suggest  that capabilities become the sole framework for  pursuing climate equity. Responsibility for climate  change, including historical responsibility, remains  fundamental to the equity discussion and to shaping  global mitigation and adaptation efforts.  To provide a framework for developing and  evaluating countries’ intended nationally determined  contributions (NDCs) in the negotiations,  this report proposes equity criteria based on  national capabilities along with emissions responsibility.  It then suggests how a capabilities approach  can focus attention on the ways in which each  element of the 2015 Agreement can build the  capabilities of countries and communities.  Each of these components is described in more  detail below.    PATHWAYS TO A  LOW-CARBON FUTURE EXAMPLES OF CLIMATE ACTIONS THAT PROTECT OR ENHANCE CAPABILITIES  Renewable energy access  and deployment  Scaling-up the use of renewable energy can improve energy security and access while avoiding  greenhouse gas emissions, and can also offer long-term economic savings and health benefits (Torres-  Duque et al. 2008; Fullerton, Bruce, and Gordon 2008; Palit and Chaurey 2011; Köhlin et al. 2011).  By making finance for renewable energy accessible to marginalized and nontraditional banking  populations (Omwansa and Sullivan 2014) or by designing equitable feed-in tariffs or other  mechanisms (Tongsopit 2014; Chrometzka 2014 ), deployment of renewable energy can enhance  capabilities (Mendonça, Lacey, and Hvelplund 2009).  Equitable carbon pricing Carbon pricing schemes can incentivize emission reductions, support energy efficiency and security  initiatives, and protect or enhance capabilities. Progressive schemes can redirect revenues or other  in-kind benefits to vulnerable populations (British Columbia 2009) (California 2014).  International and national efforts to promote carbon pricing or markets should be based on  assessments of differential vulnerability and include stakeholder participation to ensure that monetary  and nonmonetary benefits flow to vulnerable populations.  Fossil fuel subsidy reform Reduction and eventual elimination of fossil fuel subsidies could contribute to emissions reductions,  support energy efficiency and security, and free up resources for other development priorities, all of  which could benefit long-term capabilities (Mourougane 2010) (IEA 2012).  Subsidies often do not provide a direct benefit to the poorest communities, which are the most  vulnerable to the effects of reform (Arze del Granado, Javier, Coady, and Gillingham 2012). Reform  efforts require careful design and can include transfer mechanisms, broad public communication, and  supports for core development needs (Hassanzadeh 2012).  Low-carbon transportation  planning  Safe and affordable transport options are crucial from a capabilities perspective. Low-carbon transport  systems can help meet mobility needs, as well as reduce emissions and provide health benefits (United  Nations 2013).  Using policy and finance signals to incentivize development of public transit has been successful in  multiple contexts (Road Traffic Technology n.d.).  Community forestry Strengthening community forest management and community forest rights can help reduce emissions  and can also enhance capabilities (Stevens et al. 2014). Efforts to establish legal protections, support  community-led reforestation, and support community management can contribute to both climate and  capabilities goals.   Recommendations for International  Institutions and Policymakers  International institutions and policymakers can  help enable national and local governments to  undertake the types of equitable climate policies  highlighted in Tables 1 and 2. To encourage action,  this report proposes recommendations for a wide  range of international institutions and policymakers,  including multilateral and bilateral development  finance institutions. These recommendations  include the need to:  ▪▪Provide upfront investment for low-carbon pathways  and adaptation efforts that are designed to  enhance equity and build capabilities, including  for equitably designed energy policies.  ▪▪Provide technical assistance, capacity building,  and guidance to enable countries to formulate  and implement the types of equitable climate  policies highlighted here.  ▪▪Ensure that finance is accessible to those who  need it, including nontraditional banking populations,  to undertake innovative and locally  appropriate climate action.  ▪▪Support the implementation of “before and  after” vulnerability assessments and evaluations  to identify impacts of climate action on  the capabilities of affected groups.  ▪▪Enable participatory planning and stakeholder  engagement in the development of climate  policies across all sectors.  Operationalizing Equity and Capabilities  in the 2015 Climate Agreement  The 2015 international climate agreement offers a  critical opportunity to make fundamental progress  on equity issues globally. A capabilities approach to  equity can inform two key dimensions of the agreement.  The first dimension concerns the content of  individual countries’ intended nationally determined  Table 2 | Equitable Climate Policies to Achieve Adaptation and Resilience  BUILDING ADAPTIVE  CAPACITY AND RESILIENCE EXAMPLES OF USING CLIMATE ACTION TO PROTECT OR ENHANCE CAPABILITIES  Addressing adaptation needs  of the most vulnerable  populations  Recognizing that different levels and types of vulnerability exist, both among and within communities,  can help generate equitable adaptation and resilience plans that focus on capabilities.  Integrating assessments of climate hazards with assessments of social vulnerability can result in more  targeted and effective policy interventions (Burton, Huq, Lim, et al. 2002; Huq, Rahman, Konate, et al.  2003; Adger, Neil, Agrawala, et al. 2007).  Inclusive participation Enabling communities and vulnerable populations to determine effective adaptation and resilience  strategies through highly participatory processes can increase their ability to take locally appropriate  and long-term adaptation measures that protect and enhance their social and economic opportunities  (WRI, UNPD, UNEP, et al. 2011; Osbeck. Powell, Gerger Swartling. et al. 2010).  Support for innovation Providing access to credit to early adopters of innovative adaptation and resilience practices,  particularly among highly vulnerable populations, and enabling local and indigenous practices to be  disseminated, are essential to mobilizing effective adaptation (UNFCCC 2013).  National equitable  adaptation planning  Prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable in national adaptation planning, ensuring their  participation in the planning process, and undertaking robust assessments of vulnerability that address  capabilities and social and economic contexts, can all play a vital role in achieving equitable adaptation  and resilience outcomes (UNFCCC 2013).  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 7  contributions (NDCs), while the second dimension  concerns the multiple elements of the 2015 Agreement  as a whole—including mitigation, adaptation,  loss and damage, finance, capacity building, technology,  and transparency and accountability.  Incorporate Equity and Capabilities into Intended  Nationally Determined Contributions  1. Use equity considerations in formulating and  evaluating national contributions  Intended NDCs, which are to become the core  national commitments in the 2015 Agreement,  provide a focal point for embedding equity into the  agreement. The process established for intended  NDCs in the 2015 agreement should ensure that  contributions are equitable as well as sufficient to  achieve the objectives of the Convention. The following  aspects of equity provide a set of criteria by  which to measure the types and levels of contributions  that countries should put forward:  ▪▪Emissions responsibility, including historical,  current, and projected emissions both in per  capita and aggregate terms; and  ▪▪National capabilities, including:  □□ human development;  □□ economic capacity, including consideration  of the relative costs of climate action and the  economic benefits from taking climate action;  □□ resilience to climate impacts, including  physical security and capacity to adapt in  the face of climate change; and  □□ governance capacity and social support  structures.  These criteria offer a perspective concerning respective  capabilities in a range of countries, while maintaining  the clear differences between developed and  developing countries. The criteria provide a means  to evaluate countries’ intended NDCs in terms of  the types and levels of actions proposed.  2. Include specific capabilities-focused policies in  nationally determined contributions  The benefit of using a capabilities approach to help  countries identify specific policies to include in their  intended NDCs is that it encourages an examination  of actual pathways—and potential barriers—to  achieving equitable climate action. Considering  intended NDCs in terms of their national capabilities  provides countries with the opportunity to  identify actions that can be undertaken without  additional resources, as well as further actions that  would be possible with international support.   Incorporate Equity and Capabilities across  Multiple Elements of the 2015 Agreement  1. Focus adaptation and loss and damage on the  most vulnerable populations  A capabilities approach highlights the role that  well-designed adaptation policies can play in  protecting and improving the long-term well-being  and livelihoods of vulnerable populations. The 2015  Agreement should include a collective goal focused  on building the resilience of the most vulnerable  populations. Given the increasing importance of  loss and damage and the need to develop a response  that is robust, consistent, and sustained, the 2015  Agreement should also support the development of  national loss and damage scoping studies to identify  the needs of particularly vulnerable populations.  2. Provide adequate and targeted finance to build  capabilities  Adequate and appropriately directed finance is essential  to building capabilities and enhancing equity. The  2015 Agreement should link post-2020 finance with  developing countries’ national climate strategies and  provide the investment needed for climate policies that  also focus on strengthening long-term capabilities.  3. Create a capacity-building facility  A lack of governance and technical capacity constrains  many governments from undertaking the  planning and analysis needed to take climate action  and enhance capabilities (UNFCCC 2014a). To  prioritize capacity building within the UNFCCC, the  2015 Agreement should create a dedicated capacity-building  facility, which would serve as a focal point to  design, coordinate, support, and manage capability  building across all elements of the 2015 Agreement.  4. Develop and deploy innovative technology that  focuses on capabilities  Technology that is accessible to, and designed for,  the most vulnerable and least well off will be essential  to advancing low-carbon pathways and adapting  in ways that build capabilities. The 2015 Agreement  should stress the importance of financial institutions  in funding research, development, and deployment  of innovative technologies with a particular focus  on technologies that can build the capabilities of the  most vulnerable and least well off.  5. Strengthen transparency and accountability with  a focus on capabilities  Transparency and accountability are essential for a  climate agreement capable of tracking progress and  deepening action over time. A capabilities approach  emphasizes the need to build countries’ capabilities  so they can track and report on emissions, climate  action, and finance. It also focuses on integrating  monitoring of the ways in which climate policy  affects capabilities.  6. Establish an equitable long-term mitigation goal  A collective long-term trajectory for emissions  reductions or specific mitigation actions should be  constructed in a way that helps countries identify  specific policies and investments that help build  capabilities, such as increased access to renewable  energy. In committing to such a goal, the 2015  Agreement must recognize that countries with  different capabilities will progress toward the goal  at different paces and support will be needed to  help countries with lower capabilities achieve the  common goal.  7. Establish cycles of action to strengthen capabilities  The set of “cycles” envisioned in the 2015 Agreement  for strengthening action after 2015 should  incorporate a focus on building capabilities  (UNFCCC 2014b). Each cycle should include an  analysis of how future actions can be designed to  further strengthen capabilities. The formulation  and assessment of countries’ commitments should  be informed by a set of equity criteria, including  those involving capabilities, determined through a  technical process in the UNFCCC after 2015.  Capabilities and Long-Term Transformation  The long-term goal of climate policy should be to  protect and strengthen the capabilities and fundamental  well-being of current and future generations.  In doing so, we must look at familiar principles  with new eyes. The discussion should not be in the  abstract but rather focused on action to preserve and  strengthen specific outcomes for people and communities.  As policymakers and communities encounter  new challenges, a capabilities approach to climate  policy analysis and implementation can help keep  the long-term enhancement of human well-being  firmly at the center of attention and build the political  momentum needed for transformation.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up INTRODUCTION  Equity is at the heart of three core issues for climate change policy:  addressing the impacts of climate change, which are felt unequally;  determining who is responsible for taking actions to limit its effects;  and understanding the ways in which climate policy intersects  with other dimensions of human development, both globally and  domestically. This report uses the capabilities approach to address  these challenges, creating a new narrative for equitable climate action  that focuses on building the capabilities of those on the ground as  well as building consensus in the international climate negotiations.   Equity in the climate change policy context is a  central, but still deeply debated, concept. In its  simplest form, equity involves concepts of fairness  or justice in the way people are treated, though it  ultimately depends on the perspectives of those  involved in striving to achieve it. The central equity  challenges for climate change policy involve several  core issues: addressing the impacts of climate  change, which are felt unequally; identifying who  is responsible for causing climate change and for  actions to limit its effects; and understanding the  ways in which climate policy intersects with other  dimensions of human development, both globally  and domestically.  In 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention  on Climate Change (UNFCCC or the Convention)  laid out the centrality of equity in its core principles.  Article 3(1) states that, “The Parties should  protect the climate system for the benefit of present  and future generations of humankind, on the basis  of equity and in accordance with their common  but differentiated responsibilities and respective  capabilities” (UNFCCC 1992).  Ever since, debates about precisely what equity  means in a climate policy context, and how to put  it into practice, have been at the center of international  climate negotiations and policymaking. Many  of these debates have focused on questions about  who should take action to combat climate change,  what actions they should take, and who should  finance them. Resolving these differences is critical  to achieving a workable international climate agreement  in 2015. It also requires us to look at equity  in new ways, to bring countries together around an  ambitious but equitable climate action agenda.  These questions found their original expression in  the Convention through differentiation of Parties  central obligations. Countries categorized under  Annex I, primarily but not solely developed countries,  are obligated to take measures to mitigate  climate change. Annex 1 Parties later agreed to  more detailed obligations and commitments for  emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol  (UNFCCC 1998 Article 3).  Differentiation between developed and developing  country Parties has also informed obligations for  finance and technology transfer under the Convention.  Developed countries in Annex II, a subset of  those included in Annex I, committed to provide  funding and other resources to help developing  countries both reduce their emissions and adapt to  climate change (Winkler and Rajamani 2013).  Over time, however, the binary distinction between  developed and developing countries has softened  as global economies and emission trajectories have  changed leading to calls from many Parties, both  developed and developing, that a new model of differentiation  may be required (Rajamani 2012, 616).  In 2011, the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17)  in Durban agreed to launch a new platform of negotiations  for a new international climate agreement  to be finalized in 2015 and become operational in  2020 (called the 2015 Agreement) (UNFCCC 2011).  The negotiating platform, called the Durban Platform,  contained no explicit reference to equity, but  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up the Parties agreed that the 2015 Agreement would  be “a protocol, another legal instrument or an  agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention  applicable to all Parties.”  The term “applicable to all” was intensely debated  at Durban because it was seen by many Parties  as signaling a political intention to create greater  symmetry in the commitments undertaken by  all Parties to the 2015 Agreement (Winkler and  Rajamani 2013, 2). How to satisfy this requirement,  while remaining under the Convention, namely the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC) as laid  out in Article 3(1), has once again brought questions  about the meaning of equity to the forefront  in international climate negotiations. If the 2015  Agreement is to establish a more complex model  of differentiation, how might it be designed to take  into account the varying human development needs  and inequities in human well-being among Parties  to the Convention? What is an equitable allocation  of responsibility and action in the context of growing  emissions and climate impacts?  In addition, the process for negotiating a new  climate agreement at COP 21 in 2015 has itself  triggered questions about fair treatment. Countries  will present the mitigation measures they propose  to undertake in the form of “intended nationally  determined contributions” (intended NDCs). These  will be assessed or reviewed and countries might  be expected to adjust their proposed contributions.  Because governments submit their own initial  proposals, there is an urgent need to determine  the equity considerations that should guide those  contributions. An expanded view of how to assess  equitable action is necessary to encapsulate the  multidimensional nature of equity.  Ensuring equity in the 2015 Agreement is not limited  to mitigation measures, a point that has been highlighted  by climate policy analysts Harald Winkler and  Lavanya Rajamani (2013, 4), stating that “Applying  equity only to mitigation is unlikely to be fair to all.”  As a result, in equity debates globally. As nations face  the early consequences of, and rising threats from,  climate impacts, the objectives and institutions of  the global climate regime, including the UNFCCC,  have expanded beyond the imperative of emissions  reduction – so too has the analysis of equity. Increasing  focus must accordingly be placed on the issues  that support climate adaptation and resilience as well  as mitigation—including finance and investment,  transparency and accountability, and technology, and  capacity building (Klinsky and Winkler 2014).  Understanding Equity in the  Context of Climate Change  Three key dimensions of equity cut across the  climate debate. These are responsibility for greenhouse  gas emissions, the disproportionate nature  of vulnerability to climate impacts and the need  to support the continued ability for countries to  develop in the face of climate change. Each of these  considerations is discussed below, highlighting the  complex and multidimensional nature of equity in  the context of climate change.   Equity Considerations in Reducing Emissions  In the climate context, international discussions of  equity have traditionally focused on interpretations  of the principle of CBDR-RC and, more specifically,  on how to apportion the mitigation actions needed  to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The responsibility  to take action has been seen as a function  of a country’s emissions: how much it has emitted,  is emitting, or will emit, have been the key factors  considered in proposing requirements for action.  However, linking greenhouse gas emissions and  mitigation actions in a concrete way has been a  matter of substantial debate.  Consider Historic Emissions  According to one view, expressed by many developing  countries, particularly emerging economies,  developed countries should take the lead in the  mitigation effort because they are historically  responsible for the majority of global greenhouse  gas emissions (see, for example, Algeria 2014;  China 2014; Cuba 2014; Like-Minded Developing  Countries 2014a; Like-Minded Developing  Countries 2014b;). Their case is bolstered by the  Convention, which states that developed countries  should “take the lead in combatting climate change”  (UNFCCC 1992).  Proponents of this viewpoint often argue that an  allocation of emissions should be assigned to countries  on a per capita basis. For instance, the BASIC  Expert Group, a group of climate policy experts  from the governments and leading academic  institutions of the BASIC countries (Brazil, South  Africa, India, and China), explored the implications  of using different cumulative emission metrics as a  framework for assigning mitigation burdens among  parties (BASIC Experts Group 2011). Among their  proposals was a methodology that involves calculating  total GHG emissions since the beginning of  the industrial revolution in 1850 on an equal per  capita basis (BASIC Experts Group 2011, 61). Using  this approach, the quantity of future emissions still  possible if the world is to keep temperature below a  specific level—the available “carbon budget”—would  be assigned to countries according to how much of  the per capita budget they have already used.  Proponents of this approach assert that, because  developed nations have exceeded their fair share of  the carbon budget, they must take the greatest share  of emissions reductions and provide the means (support  for finance, technology, capacity building) for  developing countries to mitigate and adapt.  Others, including major developed nations and  some developing countries, have argued that the  convention’s principles are dynamic and should  respond to changing environmental, geopolitical,  and economic realities (see, for example, Mexico  2014; Switzerland 2014; United States 2014;  Australia 2014; Norway 2014). Proponents argue  that all major emitters should be held to obligations  to take climate action and the UNFCCC’s annexes  must be made more flexible or relaxed.  Focus on Current Emissions  These countries argue that responsibility to act  should focus on greenhouse gases released in the  present and future to keep temperature rise below  catastrophic levels. According to this approach,  emissions are considered in the aggregate rather  than on a per capita basis, since a ton of carbon  has the same effect no matter where it is emitted.  The pattern of greenhouse gas emissions among  countries has shifted significantly in the past 15  years and will shift even further in the near future.  In 1990, developing countries (those not listed in  Annex I of the Convention) contributed 40 percent  of annual global emissions. By 2010, their share  of global emissions was nearly 60 percent; in that  time, China’s share of global emissions increased by  12 percent, representing the majority of developing  countries’ increased share (CAIT 2.0).  Proponents of this view include not only developed  countries but also countries that contribute little to  emissions but lack the financial and other resources  to adapt to climate change, such as small island  states and least developed countries. In addition,  a growing number of middle-income countries,  particularly in Latin America, have asserted that the  collective objective of avoiding catastrophic impacts  is a pressing reason for them to act by reducing  emissions (AILAC 2014).  However, the average per capita emissions of  developing countries, and particularly of the least  developed countries (LDCs), generally remain  smaller than those of developed countries. Given  that efforts to pursue development can at times  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up conflict with the need to reduce emissions, an  essential question for the long term is how developing  countries can pursue low-carbon pathways in  ways that promote economic development.  Consider Capability to Mitigate  The question of which countries should take what  mitigation actions has also been explored on the  basis of countries’ capabilities, drawing on the  “respective capabilities” language of CBDR-RC in  Article 3(1) of the Convention as a starting point.  Proponents have generally defined capability as the  ability of a country to pay for mitigation action, with  some suggesting gross domestic product (GDP) per  capita as the metric for determining capacity to pay  for emissions reductions.  Some policy experts have proposed that the weight  given to emissions in determining responsibility  could depend on whether they are “survival,”  “development,” or “luxury” emissions, and have  suggested reducing emissions responsibility to  allow for costs that are necessary for poverty reduction  (Fleurbaey et al. 2014, sec. 4.6.2.1; Müller  and Mahadeva 2013, 2). Using this approach, the  concept of capability includes the “right to development,”  implying that least-able countries would  have lower emissions reduction requirements,  based on measures such as the Human Development  Index (BASIC Experts Group 2011).  Use an Equity Reference Framework  More recently, the Africa Group and others have  proposed the use of an “Equity Reference Framework”  (ERF) to inform emissions reduction allocations  (Africa Group 2014). This would include a  basket of factors, such as emissions responsibility,  GDP per capita, and development metrics, allowing  a more flexible approach that reflects the multiple  dimensions of equity in a climate context.  Cost Effectiveness  An additional approach to respective capabilities,  is to consider the cost-effectiveness of countries’  actions to reduce emissions, which suggests that  reductions should be apportioned to equalize marginal  costs across countries (Höhne, den Elzen, and  Escalante 2013, 5; Höhne, et al. 2014, 2).  Equity Considerations in Climate Impacts  In addition to responsibility for emissions, the  impacts of climate change on human society also  raises profound equity concerns that must be  addressed through climate action. The Fifth Assessment  Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) warned that climate change  is happening now and that, within the 21st Century,  “climate-change impacts are projected to slow down  economic growth, make poverty reduction more  difficult, further erode food security, and prolong  existing and create new poverty traps, the latter  particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots  of hunger.” (Romani, Rydge, and Stern 2012).  These climate impacts will be felt globally, but they  will not be experienced equally. The impacts of  climate change pose, and will continue to pose, the  greatest threats to those most vulnerable—typically  those who have the fewest resources to meet them,  or are the most socially and politically marginalized  (Box 1). This is true today and will be for many  decades to come, with future generations—who  have no representation and have not contributed  to the problem—likely to be most affected. For   example, shifting monsoon seasons are likely to  disrupt agricultural patterns across South Asia,  wreaking havoc with communities’ abilities to grow  sufficient food and continue to inhabit rural agricultural  areas. Salt-water intrusion, sea level rise,  and coastal erosion could threaten physical safety,  economic vitality and the ability to pursue livelihoods  in coastal communities around the world.  Even a 1.5o C global temperature increase will result  in serious harm to sensitive areas and vulnerable  populations (IPCC 2014).  Meeting Development Needs  Addressing issues of human development are  critical to consensus-based international climate  action. The causes and consequences of climate  change are deeply intertwined with global patterns  of inequality. Climate change acts as a multiplier of  existing vulnerabilities and threatens to roll back  gains in poverty reduction and progress toward the  Millennium Development Goals that already have  been achieved as well as undermining future efforts  toward the Sustainable Development Goals (World  Bank 2010).  There is no argument among countries that economic  development must continue in order to  address the substantial global inequities in wellbeing.  Although global poverty has been halved in  recent decades, wide disparities remain in health,  education, energy, housing, transport, and access  to water and other resources (World Bank 2014b).  Recognition of ongoing human development needs  in the climate context has always been enshrined in  Article 2 of the Convention, which recognizes that  GHG stabilization, “should be achieved within a  time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt  naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production  is not threatened and to enable economic  development to proceed in a sustainable manner”  (UNFCCC 1992). Thus, efforts to reduce development  inequities among countries must inform any  climate policy approach, if it is to be considered  equitable. Moreover, progress in human development  is threatened by increasing climate impacts,  whose severity varies in part according to the vulnerability  and capacity of those facing them. Building  the underlying capabilities of communities is  therefore a central strategy for minimizing climate  losses and safeguarding human development.  Recent evidence shows substantial opportunities for  social and economic gains from climate action, in  addition to savings related to avoiding catastrophic  impacts (The Global Commission on the Economy  and Climate 2014). Moreover, as this report argues,  climate action is mutually supportive of efforts to  build capabilities and enhance equity.  A New Narrative  Global progress has been held back largely by  disagreement over what level of action is appropriate  for whom and when such action must be taken.  Disagreement has been most contentious when  considering competing needs for development and  climate action—often creating a false competition,  resulting in a zero-sum outcome. Since climate  action is in the long-term interest of all, establishment  of the conditions supporting consensus is also  in the interest of all. What is needed is an understanding  of how action will strengthen consensus  over time so that increasingly stronger action can  be taken to confront climate change and achieve  development simultaneously.  References to vulnerability, and those most vulnerable,  capture those systems, sectors, regions, and individuals  most likely to be especially impacted by climate change.  The types of climate change impacts that will occur, such  as shifts in seasonal rainfall, droughts, cyclones, and  rising sea levels, will vary from location to location.  The severity of impacts in any location will be  determined, in part, by the vulnerability of the local  people and ecosystems on which they rely. These  differences in vulnerability—both within and among  countries—stem from a wide range of social, economic,  political, geographical, and ecological factors. In  all sectors and regions, certain groups of people  will be particularly vulnerable because of structural  and situational drivers of vulnerability that may be  unconnected to geographical location. These typically  include the poor, young children, women, the elderly and  populations such as indigenous people who have been  historically marginalized and underrepresented.  BOX 1 | WHO IS MOST VULNERABLE TO  CLIMATE CHANGE?  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up If this is to happen, this report argues, we must  consider familiar principles in new contexts. In  considering the principles of equity and CBDR-RC,  an enhanced notion of “respective capabilities”  should inform our deliberations. When responsibility  to take action is discussed, the discussion should  be focused on responsibility for action to achieve  particular outcomes. We suggest that one important  outcome is to preserve and strengthen the capabilities  of people, especially the poor and most vulnerable,  to confront climate change. Over time, this  will build the capacity of nations and strengthen  their ability to take climate action, and can even  strengthen the consensus for action.  Fortunately, we have reached a point where countries  do not have to choose between making progress  on poverty and growth and confronting climate  change. In the following chapters, we elaborate on  the meaning and significance of viewing climate  action through the lens of a capabilities approach.  We show how capabilities can be strengthened by  climate action at the country level in a way that  promotes equity and addresses poverty.  This report does not argue that a capabilities  approach should become the only framework  for pursuing climate equity. Rather, we propose  that the concept of capabilities offers useful guidance  in achieving equitable climate action that  is grounded in a thorough understanding of the  geographical, social, and economic differentiation  that exists among individuals and communities.  This understanding can be used to build consensus  and collective ambition in the international climate  agreement in 2015, as well as to support the design  and implementation of policies at all scales that  strengthen capabilities.    RIGHTS, CAPABILITIES  AND BUILDING EQUITY  Given the state of equity discussions in the climate negotiations, and  the opportunities and challenges provided by the 2015 Agreement,  this chapter introduces the concept of the capabilities approach  and discusses how it applies to climate action. We describe how  the capabilities of individuals, communities and nations can  be built through well designed climate action. By proposing a  capabilities approach for climate action, we also explain how a  focus on capabilities in climate policy can be used to augment an  understanding of national capabilities and common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).   Given the state of equity discussions in the climate  negotiations, and the opportunities and challenges  provided by the 2015 Agreement, this chapter  introduces the concept of the capabilities approach  and discusses how it applies to climate action. We  describe how the capabilities of individuals, communities  and nations can be built through well-designed  climate action. By proposing a capabilities  approach for climate action, we also explain how  a focus on capabilities in climate policy can also  be used to augment an understanding of national  capabilities and common but differentiated responsibilities  and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).  The Relationship of Capabilities to  Human Rights and Development  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states  that “All human beings are born free and equal in  dignity and rights” (United Nations 1948, Article 1).  The declaration then articulates a suite of fundamental  rights common to all people, which they  should be able to exercise. These include:  ▪▪Rights to life and liberty and security of person  ▪▪Social, political, and cultural rights that guarantee  one’s right to engage in social and political  life and participate in decision-making  ▪▪Rights designed to ensure adequate material  resources to allow free and dignified choices.  Since its adoption in 1948, the Universal Declaration  of Human Rights has become a powerful document  asserting the essential importance of each individual’s  claim to the core rights needed to live a dignified  life. These rights have been adopted by the vast  majority of the world’s countries, but many people  are still denied some or all of their human rights. For  example, Article 23 recognizes that “everyone has the  right to work, to free choice of employment, to just  and favorable conditions of work and to protection  against unemployment.” Yet, faced with dire poverty  and limited opportunities to access education, mobility,  or essential resources, millions of people do not  have free choice of employment or access to safe or  adequate working conditions.  It was recognition of precisely this gap between the  fundamental rights all people can claim in theory,  and their ability to access and exercise these rights  in practice that spurred a focus on capabilities.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Focus on Capabilities  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, development  specialists Amartya Sen (Sen 1999) and Martha  Nussbaum (Nussbaum 2003) proposed that  scholars and public policymakers focus on efforts  to ensure capabilities. In this context, capabilities  are what provide people the ability to achieve their  human rights. For example, a capabilities approach  asks whether people are able to become educated,  and then examines what resources are needed to  ensure that all people can access and exercise their  right to education. This approach to public policy  has been deployed in a wide range of contexts (see  Robeyns 2006 for a review). For instance, it has  been used to examine the ways in which gender  (Robeyns 2003) and disability (Burchardt 2004;  Nussbaum 2009) have shaped the achievements  and choices of women and people with disabilities.  In these cases, it has led to better identification  of specific policies and changes needed to help  empower people to achieve their capabilities.  A capabilities approach has been instrumental in  informing thinking in the development arena (Box  2, leading, for example, to the formulation of the  Human Development Index produced by the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In the  climate context, its central tenet—that capabilities  are needed to ensure realization of human  rights—can be used to propose proactive capability-building  strategies as part of climate policy.  Amartya Sen characterized a capabilities approach as  a way to recognize that human flourishing depends on  multiple factors, such as adequate shelter, sufficient  nutrition, and social engagement, that cannot be easily  aggregated into a single metric.  Recognition that human development could not be  captured by a single metric informed the design of the  United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP)  Human Development Index, which covers several key  capabilities—namely health, education, and economic  resources. However, the index was seen as only one  possible manifestation of a capabilities approach.  Since then, the UNDP’s annual Human Development  Reports have expanded on multiple aspects of  capabilities—including gender, human rights, and  democratic political institutions (see Fukuda-Parr 2003  for a review).  The central rationale for using a capabilities approach  has been to identify what supports or hinders people as  they try to live full lives. In Sen’s words, “development is  freedom.” This capabilities perspective can draw attention  to pathways that enhance people’s well-being and can be  used to identify strategies that support climate actions  and contribute to multiple aspects of human well-being.  BOX 2 | USING A CAPABILITIES  APPROACH IN PUBLIC POLICY   Human Well-Being  The capabilities approach focuses directly on  human well-being, which is conceptualized as the  ability of each person to have the freedom and  dignity to make meaningful choices about how he  or she wishes to live. This approach recognizes that  each human requires multiple core needs and rights  to be satisfied in order to achieve well-being. For  example, sufficient income without physical safety  does not result in well-being, nor would access to  education without sufficient nutrition. Capabilities  consist of people’s ability to access and use  resources to achieve their own ideas about what a  dignified life looks like.  The conceptualization of human well-being in the  capabilities approach is important in two ways.  First, the capabilities approach recognizes multiple,  no-nsubstitutable capabilities because of the  multidimensionality of human well-being. Second,  by centering on human well-being, the capabilities  sees resources as necessary means to an end but  not the core focus of attention. Instead, a capabilities  approach emphasizes the need to understand  which resources or opportunities are limiting the  achievement of well-being in particular situations  and to focus on identifying pathways for building  capabilities. Using this approach can move debates  away from zero-sum stalemates about resources in  the abstract, and refocus attention to the creative  process of supporting people’s ongoing efforts to  achieve well-being.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides  a framework for identifying capabilities essential to  realizing human rights. An ongoing debate has examined  the need for, or utility of, a universal list of capabilities. In  this report we do not insist on a universal list but suggest  that many important capabilities can be identified by  basing our conception of human well-being on the  call for human rights. An illustrative list of capabilities  stemming from the Declaration, and likely to be impacted  in a changing climate, includes the following:  ▪▪Sufficient nutrition as guaranteed by the right to life  (Article 3)  ▪▪Physical safety, health, and bodily integrity (Article 3,  Article 25)  ▪▪Adequate shelter and physical comfort (Article 25)  ▪▪Sufficient and safe employment (Article 23)  ▪▪Active inclusion and engagement in a meaningful  social network or community (Article 27)  ▪▪Access to education (Article 26)  ▪▪The opportunity to be engaged in decision-making at  the individual or collective level (Article 21)  BOX 3 | CAPABILITIES AND  THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION  OF HUMAN RIGHTS  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In proposing the capabilities approach as a new lens  through which to achieve equity in climate actions,  there must be an awareness of its limitations. A key  criticism has been that while the approach provides  a framework for analyzing the relationships between  specific policies and human well-being, it does not  provide a full-fledged theory of justice (Robeyns  2005). It does not tell us who should be responsible  for providing the resources necessary to achieving  capabilities, although it does help us identify who  has which capabilities, and why differences among  people or groups of people may be occurring. In  addition, there is a wide range of capabilities; fully  assessing all of them would be data intensive and  perhaps impossible (Clark 2006).  In this report, we do not seek to evaluate a complete  set of capabilities for an individual or group of individuals;  rather, we use the approach to identify links  between climate policies and capabilities in the interest  of proactively designing policies that can enhance  equity (Box 3). Sen’s capabilities approach asks us  to focus on understanding what, exactly, is either  helping or preventing people from being able to live  in dignity; each person should have the resources  and opportunities to be able to make meaningful  decisions about how he or she wishes to live his or  her life. We therefore focus our discussion of equity  on the most vulnerable and the least well off because  they either do not have sufficient capabilities or are  on the edge of having these capabilities eroded to a  point at which they would again face deeply limiting  options about their lives (Box 4).  The capabilities that we address are a starting point  to illustrate how the capabilities approach can  support the achievement of broader human rights  in line with the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and support an understanding of national  capabilities to augment the principle of CBDR-RC  in the international context.  The capabilities approach is not a complete theory of  justice because it does not indicate specifically what an  equitable allocation of resources or burdens is, nor does  it identify who is responsible for particular obligations.  Instead, the capability approach acknowledges the equal  value of all people, and imposes a strong guideline  that each person must have sufficient resources and  opportunities to live in dignity, however he or she defines  this. The opportunities people have to make genuinely  free decisions are their “capabilities.” This criterion  draws attention to the situation of those who either do  not have sufficient capabilities, or who are on the edge of  having these capabilities eroded to a point at which they  would lose the ability to make free and dignified choices  about their lives. For this reason the report focuses  particularly on the capabilities of those who are least well  off or most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.  BOX 4 | WHY THE CAPABILITY APPROACH  FOCUSES ON THE MOST VULNERABLE  AND LEAST WELL OFF   Characteristics of a Capabilities Approach  Viewing equity through the lens of a capabilities  approach places people and communities at the  heart of climate policy and moves beyond abstract  arguments about burden sharing. The key driver for  such an approach is recognition that climate change  will have particularly negative impacts on those  who are most vulnerable, regardless of where they  live. Without addressing this fundamental inequity  and supporting approaches that build capabilities  as well as the systems that provide for them, the  international response to climate change will fall  short of its equitability mandate.  Three core characteristics of the capabilities  approach enable the approach to guide policy  towards a focus on people and communities and  towards equitable climate action. These are that  human well-being is (1) multidimensional, (2) it  is the end goal, and (3) individual capabilities are  embedded in larger systems. Each characteristic is  described below.  Human Well-Being is Multidimensional  As described earlier, a basic tenet of a capabilities  approach is the recognition that each human being  has multiple human rights, and these are not substitutable.  Since capabilities are what people need to  realize and use their rights, capabilities too are multiple  and non-substitutable, although interdependent.  For example, the ability to access and benefit  from education requires several other capabilities,  including the ability to enjoy bodily health and  experience physical and psychological safety. If a  child does not have sufficient nutrition, physical  safety, and social support, she is unlikely to benefit  fully from the presence of a village school to access  her right to education, but this does not mean that  these capabilities are interchangeable. Rather, they  are interdependent, and non-substitutable.  The multidimensional nature of well-being means  that single metrics cannot and should not be used to  determine equity in the context of climate-change  policies. If the ultimate goal of climate policy efforts  is to promote and ensure human flourishing, then a  multidimensional approach that acknowledges many  different human needs and capabilities is required.  Human Well-Being is the End Goal  A capabilities approach places the achievement of  human well-being as the ultimate end goal. This is  also reflected in the UNFCCC’s objective of human  development: “The ultimate objective of this Convention  … is to achieve… stabilization of greenhouse  gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that  would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference  with the climate system. Such a level should be  achieved within a timeframe sufficient…to enable  economic development to proceed in a sustainable  manner.” (UNFCCC 1992, Article 2)  We argue that climate change policy should also be  oriented toward furthering human well-being both  through avoiding climate impacts, and through  using climate action to support and enhance  capabilities. The capabilities approach forces decision-makers  to consider the resources that might  be needed in specific situations, and encourages  long-term innovative thinking about policy options  for achieving well-being.  Individual Capabilities are Embedded  in Larger Systems  Finally, people do not live in isolation but are  embedded in social, political, and economic systems.  The capability to achieve human well-being depends  on a range of resources, many of which need to be  supplied by the state or society in general. Capabilities  are experienced individually; however, social,  economic, and material structures, many of which  operate at the national level, provide the foundations  for developing individual capabilities.  While national and individual capabilities are  different, they are related. By acknowledging the  extent to which human capabilities and well-being  in general are dependent on, and affected by, larger  national systems and structures, we can begin to  think further about countries’ capabilities that  should be included in international debates about  equity and climate action.  The capabilities of countries, in terms of their abilities  to provide structures and resources to enable  human well-being, is an important element of the  international equity conversation around action  on climate change, discussed later in this chapter.  Because inadequate access to resources can prevent  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up people from developing capabilities, attention to  both specific resource needs and their distribution  is important for directing policy efforts toward  increasing the capabilities of the most vulnerable or  least well off.  Two Pillars for a Capabilities Approach  to Climate Change Equity  Drawing on an understanding of the capabilities  approach as expressed above, this report proposes  that the international community adopt the  approach as a means of embedding equity in climate  policy. The capabilities approach, as it applies  to climate equity, rests on two interrelated pillars:  Pillar 1. Sufficient mitigation and adaptation actions  are required to prevent the direct impacts of climate  change from eroding the capabilities of the least well  off and most vulnerable, now and in the future.  This pillar concerns the direct impacts of climate  change on people’s capabilities, particularly those  of the most vulnerable. This includes impacts that  result from inadequate mitigation, insufficient  adaptation, or a failure to address loss and damage  caused by climate change. Impacts on both current  and future generations should be considered.  Pillar 2. Climate policies should be designed to  enhance, rather than diminish, the capabilities of  those who are most vulnerable, least well off, and  least able to represent themselves.  This pillar addresses the effects that climate policies  themselves can have on human capabilities. Climate  policies to reduce emissions or build resilience to  climate impacts can either enhance the capabilities  of the most vulnerable and least well off, or exacerbate  existing inequities and undermine efforts in  other policy arenas.  Taken together, these two pillars provide a basis for  understanding how to apply a capabilities approach  to equity in climate action. Such a basis encourages  climate policies to seek to build long-term capabilities,  while also contributing to society’s ability to  move toward a low-carbon and climate-resilient  model of development. By recognizing that climate  action and equity are linked and can be mutually  supportive, this base requires focusing attention  and resources on ensuring that climate action  contributes to efforts to promote the well-being of  all vulnerable people—regardless of location—and  to preferentially provide benefits to those who are  least well off, or least represented.  A capabilities approach to achieving climate equity  demands strong mitigation action to avoid future  climate impacts, addressing equity concerns  Intergenerational equity is the principle that humans  “hold the natural and cultural environment of the Earth  in common both with other members of the current  generation and with other generations, past and future  (Weiss 1990). It is a core component of equity.  The UNFCCC recognizes that climate change is  fundamentally an intergenerational problem. ”The Parties  should protect the climate system for the benefit of  present and future generations of humankind, on the  basis of equity and in accordance with their common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities”  (UNFCCC 1992, Article 3[1]).  Strong mitigation action to prevent a 2oC warming, and  the devastating impacts it would trigger, is essential to  protecting the core capabilities of future generations. In  addition, purposefully considering future generations  in the design of climate action could build their  capabilities and well-being. For example, efforts to  invest in new employment strategies that expand the  reach of renewable energy to marginalized communities  could provide long-term livelihood options. Similarly,  investments in low-carbon, climate-resilient building  or climate-resilient agriculture research and practice  support the ability of communities and countries to build  the foundations for future well-being.  Thinking about intergenerational equity from a  capabilities perspective may help to identify investments  that could reduce future generations’ vulnerability to  such situations. For example, Bangladesh is building  long-term capabilities in the face of serious coastal  threats by increasing educational opportunities. Shifting  the employment patterns of youth and future generations  away from agriculture in climate-sensitive areas and  toward new opportunities could build long-term  resilience, but it requires investments in education now.  BOX 5 | INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY  AND CAPABILITIES   under the first pillar. However, since many climate  impacts are already occurring, it also urges actions  that include efforts to address those impacts in  ways that will build the long-term capabilities of  impacted communities. It emphasizes that climate  action should not come at the expense of human  well-being (second pillar).  Finally, and of critical importance, a capabilities  approach is applicable to both current and future  generations, and therefore accords with the principle  of intergenerational equity (Box 5). Climate  change presents significant threats to future wellbeing.  Not only are future generations likely to be  most vulnerable to its impact, they are also least  represented in current decisions on climate action.  Without transformation toward low-carbon and  climate-resilient development, future generations  who played no part in generating historic emissions  will have increased difficulty in achieving wellbeing.  A capabilities approach can therefore serve  as a useful tool to guide policymakers toward efforts  that support the development of long-term and  lasting human capabilities and the ultimate goal of  transformative climate action.  Capabilities and the International  Equity Challenge  National Capabilities and Climate Change  Many of the core systems crucial to the development  of capabilities—including education, health  care, social security, legal recourse for public  engagement and property rights, and the judiciary—  are explicitly dependent on functioning  governments. Other resources needed for certain  capabilities, such as income, are tightly linked to  the vitality of national economic systems. At some  level, all capabilities depend on physical security  and environmental integrity.  As highlighted in the Introduction, the capabilities  approach was designed to facilitate comparison  and to highlight inequalities in actual or potential  capabilities. This element of the approach can be  used to operationalize concepts of equity in international  negotiations under the UNFCCC. Individual  rights and capabilities are at the heart of the  capabilities approach, and are necessary to ensure  the achievement of equity concerns in international  and national policy decisions. Nevertheless,  international policymaking within the UNFCCC is  largely concerned with agreements among nations  and requires some degree of comparing capabilities  among countries.  While the capabilities of individuals and nations  are very different, they are also related and can be  mutually supportive. The capabilities of a nation  are a product of the capabilities of its individual  citizens, and conversely, individuals’ capabilities are  embedded within the broader social system, which  is facilitated or created by the nation.  In recognition of the socially embedded nature of  individual capabilities, this report proposes four  national capabilities. They provide a limited but  pragmatic starting point for considering capabilities  in the UNFCCC discussions. They relate to core  systems that enable individuals to achieve their  capabilities. The four national capabilities are:  human development, economic capacity, resilience  to climate impacts, and governance capacity and  social security structures. Together these four capabilities  can be used to craft a more robust framing  of “respective capabilities” than has previously been  developed. Each is described below as it relates to  climate change, along with possible metrics.  Human development  A country’s level of human development has long  been acknowledged as an important component of  its capabilities. The aggregate state of well-being of  a national population clearly affects what is possible  in terms of climate action, and what is needed in  terms of policies to enhance individual capabilities.  Aggregate well-being can include factors such  as health and education, levels of poverty, access  to energy sources, and gender equality. A range of  metrics has been used to describe human development,  the most common of which is the Human  Development Index; a metric that itself was based  on a capabilities approach. Other ways of representing  human development include aggregate  measurements of poverty—number of people living  on less than $2 a day, or people with insufficient  energy access—or through specialized metrics that  take other issues into account, such as the Gender  Inequality Index.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Economic capacity  Economic capacity has long been of central concern  in the discussion of capabilities. A country’s ability  to make the investments required for climate  mitigation or adaptation, or compensating for loss  and damage, is directly tied to its access to liquid  financial assets, its debt load, and overall fiscal  health. From the perspective of its citizens, issues  like employment, functioning local markets, and  access to credit may be crucial for the development  of capabilities. The economic costs to a country of  climate actions can be significant; what often goes  unexamined is the economic benefit a country can  derive from climate actions.  Resilience to climate impacts  Climate impacts can significantly reduce capabilities,  particularly of those who are most vulnerable  or least well off. Future generations also face  heightened risks from climate impacts. At the  national level, physical, social, and economic security  against climate change is an important element  of capabilities. A country that faces major threats  to its physical security or cultural heritage and  identity from climate change must divert resources  to address the issue and, if these efforts are insufficient,  to deal with the short- and long-term impacts  of loss and damage.  Governance capacity and social support structures  The ability of a national government to effectively  govern and make decisions within its territory,  regulate industries, provide adequate social support,  and provide access to justice for all citizens within  national borders, is a necessary condition for supporting  a wide range of individual capabilities. Effective  governance is also necessary to enable climate action  to be designed and implemented in ways that can both  meet climate goals and enhance capabilities.  For example, as countries face climate impacts,  investments in social support systems may provide  necessary development opportunities in vulnerable  communities. Similarly, sufficient governmental  capacity to conduct impact assessments and monitor  policy effectiveness is important in all forms of climate  action. The inclusion of governance capacity as a  national capability resonates with the long-standing  acknowledgment of the importance of capacity building  as a key element in enabling broad climate action.   Metrics for national capabilities  Countries, like individuals, have multiple capabilities;  a fact that poses challenges to developing  an aggregated measure. In Table 3, we suggest a  number of possible metrics that might be used in  assessing national capabilities.  Some metrics, such as countries’ Human Development  Index ratings, or income per capita, are  already available and can be compared easily.  Others, such as qualitative loss and damage risks to  cultural systems, or degree of governmental competence,  are more difficult to measure but they may  be no less essential to an adequate assessment of a  country’s overall ability to support the core systems  required for citizens to develop their capability  potential. We propose that countries should be  encouraged to use quantitative metrics where  appropriate and systematically recognize elements  that cannot easily be quantified and include them in  overall evaluations of national capabilities.  Common but Differentiated  Responsibilities and Respective  Capabilities  The principle of “common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities” (CBDRRC)  is fundamental to the UNFCCC, and to the  concept of operationalizing equity. To date, considerable  effort has been devoted to understanding  the implications of the “common but differentiated  responsibilities” component, but the “respective  capabilities” element has been less fully explored.  While a capabilities approach itself is not a theory  of justice, the concept of capabilities can be applied  within the international framework established by  the UNFCCC (Box 6). This report proposes that a  robust approach for assessing capabilities be used  alongside assessments of responsibility. Such an  approach would not replace concerns about responsibility,  but would offer an expanded framework for  discussing national capabilities, and for identifying  and supporting actions aimed at protecting the  most vulnerable, the poor, and future generations.  In the international climate context, this means that  countries with greater capabilities should take the  lead on climate action and actively support policies  and measures that have the potential to build the  capabilities of the most vulnerable or least well off.  The underlying argument is that equity is multifaceted  and makes multiple demands: global mitigation  and adaptation to address existing impacts is  essential for well-being now and in the future, and  efforts to support and implement climate action  should be shared with due consideration for both  responsibility and capabilities. Addressing climate  change need not impose only burdens; smart  climate policies could result in significant long-term  benefits. This multifaceted approach offers multiple  resources for supporting the political momentum  needed to achieve global climate stabilization and  build capabilities.

Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Using the Capabilities Approach  in a Climate Context  The capabilities approach, as it is understood at  both the individual and national levels, has four  elements that facilitate its use as a framework for  advancing equity in climate action: focus on the  most vulnerable and least well off, now and in the  future; address benefits as well as burdens; focus on  pathways of action; and effectively engage respective  capabilities. The elements are elaborated below.  Focus on the most vulnerable and least well off,  now and in the future  Using a capabilities approach maintains focus on  those who are most vulnerable or least well off,  now and in the future, regardless of where they are  located. Such an approach requires that significant,  and equal, attention be paid to adaptation, building  resilience, and addressing loss and damage. Applying  a capabilities approach allows these issues to be  addressed at the core, not the periphery, of climate  action. When looking at individual capabilities  and pathways for action, it stresses awareness of  differences in vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and  resources, even within communities.  Address benefits as well as burdens  The capabilities approach highlights the opportunities  that climate action has for human development.  For instance, developments in renewable energy  and energy efficiency have the potential to provide  rural electrification, which improves health and  economic opportunities for communities. Further-  The principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities and  respective capabilities (CBDR-RC)  is built on principle 7 of the Rio  Declaration on Environment and  Development, adopted in 1992 at  the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development, but  finds expression in the UNFCCC in  Article 3; it also permeates the balance  of responsibilities between countries in  Article 4.  The phrase “respective capabilities”  suggests there are two bases  for differentiation–one based on  contribution to harm (responsibilities),  and the other based on capability to  take action (capabilities). It is implied  that such differentiation must be in  service of the common environmental  goal (Rajamani 2006).  This report does not suggest  that capabilities become the sole  framework for pursuing climate equity.  Responsibility for climate change,  including historical responsibility,  remains fundamental to shaping global  mitigation and adaptation efforts.  Acknowledging historical responsibility  for emissions is necessary because  it allows the inequity of cumulative  contributions of GHG emissions,  which have led to higher atmospheric  concentrations, to be explicitly  incorporated into the international  discussion of climate change. However,  responsibility alone cannot adequately  address either the issues raised by  inequitable climate impacts or the need  to share the benefits of climate action  and enhance human well-being.  Our proposal seeks to address  this limitation by augmenting the  principle of “respective capabilities”  with a capabilities approach that can  provide guidance for climate policy  and action. Individual and national  capabilities are separate but can be  viewed as reinforcing each other. The  capability of a country, and therefore  its ability to contribute to global climate  action, is a reflection of individual  and local capabilities. Policies  that build individual capabilities,  therefore, support the community and,  ultimately, the national system. The  evidence we present suggests that an  additional focus on the capabilities  of communities and countries will  help governments operationalize this  principle by designing climate policies  that actively promote equity and further  human development.  An emphasis on capabilities can  also underscore the ways in which  responsibility for emissions—  including historical responsibility—is  critically important. The emissions  that result in climate change are also  the cause of the climate impacts  that can erode the capabilities of the  poorest and most vulnerable. Adopting  this approach could, therefore, help  countries effectively address the  multiple dimensions of climate equity  and craft an effective and broadly  supported 2015 Agreement.  BOX 6 | A CAPABILITIES APPROACH AND THE PRINCIPLE OF COMMON BUT DIFFERENTIATED  RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESPECTIVE CAPABILITIES   more, climate-resilient agriculture has been shown  to improve food security while contributing to  global climate mitigation.  The increased potential for benefits, and opportunities  to build capabilities, necessarily adds a positive  new dimension to the climate equity debate.  Instead of overlooking this potential, a capabilities  approach asks, “how could the benefits from technological  or social innovation be used to further the  capabilities of those who have the least, or are most  vulnerable?” Conversely, capabilities can be damaged  by climate policies that are not well designed  or that have not addressed the needs of particular  communities. Either way, a capabilities approach  explicitly requires an assessment of the impact  on communities, in particular those that are most  vulnerable or least well off.  Focus attention on pathways of action  The capabilities approach encourages attention  to the specific opportunities, resources, and barriers  that either assist people to live with dignity,  or prevent them from doing so. Despite equity  being central to climate action, international equity  debates have too often ended in stalemate, with  few concrete suggestions for climate action. Many  international approaches to equity have relied on  high-level abstract metrics that are generalized  across all nations. There are good reasons for this,  since any attempt at creating a burden-sharing  arrangement needs ways of comparing countries.  However, dependence on such metrics can overlook  possibilities or pathways for action at national or  local levels.  Effectively engage respective capabilities  An understanding of capabilities and an acknowledgment  of the linkages between individual and  national capabilities benefits international policy  discussions by providing a means of more fully  comparing and evaluating the capabilities of different  countries. Defining national capabilities  provides a multidimensional framework for comparison  more suited to the diversity of countries  than are single metrics. If used within the principle  of CBDR-RC, national capabilities could provide  a pragmatic approach for comparing efforts and  contributions across countries.  Without transformation  toward low-carbon  and climate-resilient  development, future  generations who played  no part in generating  historic emissions will  have increased difficulty  in achieving wellbeing.  APPLYING THE  CAPABILITIES  APPROACH TO LOWCARBON  PATHWAYS  Climate actions that promote low-carbon energy pathways must also  build capabilities of those who are potentially most vulnerable. This  chapter examines case studies from 15 countries across five policy  areas of renewable energy deployment, carbon pricing, fossil-fuel  subsidy reform, low carbon transportation, and forest management  to draw some lessons on how climate policies enhance capabilities  and address equity. Based on these examples, we put forward  recommendations on what the role of international policies and  institutions could be and how the international community could  support national and local level low-carbon actions.   In this chapter the report examines case studies  from 15 countries, both developing and developed,  that exemplify how capabilities can be met while at  the same time pursuing a low-carbon pathway.  Although we distinguish between actions to promote  low-carbon energy pathways in this chapter  and actions to promote climate resilience in chapter  3, we recognize multiple overlaps between them in  policy areas ranging from forest protection to urban  planning. Indeed, sustainable development policies  often provide many benefits that include mitigation  and adaptation, as well as other social, economic,  and environmental objectives.  Five Key Policy Areas to Promote  Low-Carbon Pathways  Achieving adequate mitigation of emissions will  depend on the ability of countries to adopt lowcarbon  development pathways. However, to generate  international momentum and to contribute to  greater well-being, especially among those who are  most vulnerable or least well off, climate actions  must also build capabilities. Our case studies fall into  five key policy sectors: renewable energy deployment,  carbon pricing, fossil-fuel subsidy reform,  low-carbon transportation, and forest management.  In each of the five policy areas, we found that, with  effective policy design and sufficient enabling factors,  climate action can build individual capabilities.  Case studies from developed and developing countries  highlight the ways in which climate policies  can affect capabilities and equity in a diverse set of  circumstances. The lessons that emerge from these  local and regional policy efforts suggest strategies  for reorienting international policies to focus on  enabling low-carbon climate policies that simultaneously  enhance capabilities.  An overview of case studies is provided in Table 4.  We identified the linkages between each policy area  and the equity concerns and current challenges or  strategies for enhancing capabilities. In the last  part of the chapter we identify possible roles for  international policies and institutions in supporting  concrete actions in this area.  Renewable Energy Access, Deployment,  and Innovation  As the world faces growing energy demand, renewable  energy must play an increasing role if climate  stabilization goals are to be achieved. The energy  sector accounted for about 60 percent of total  global GHG emissions in 2012, and energy-related  GHG emissions have been rising. Moreover, fossil  fuels accounted for over 80 percent of global energy  consumption in 2012 (IEA 2013a) . Achieving the  2oC warming limit will require a profound transformation  of energy systems through steep declines in  carbon intensity across all sectors of the economy  (IDDRI and SDSN 2014).  In spite of the dominance of fossil fuels, in 2010  an estimated 1.3 billion people did not have access  to modern energy services, and almost 2.7 billion  people relied on traditional biomass for cooking  (IEA 2011). Over 95 percent of people without  access to modern energy services live in developing  countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and  Asia, and roughly 84 percent live in rural areas (IEA  2011; Ballesteros et al. 2013). A capability perspective  requires attention to both mitigation and  energy access, and increasing renewable energy is a  key strategy for achieving this.  Table 4 | Five Policy Areas Drawn from Case  Studies Focus on Low-Carbon Pathways  POLICY AREA FEATURED COUNTRIES    Renewable Energy and Capabilities  Access to reliable, safe, and affordable energy is an  essential element in securing a range of capabilities.  Increasing household electrification, especially  if it replaces the use of traditional biomass, can  significantly contribute to health and education and  free up time for other pursuits (Torres-Duque et al.  2008; Fullerton, Bruce, and Gordon 2008; Palit and  Chaurey 2011; Köhlin et al. 2011). Energy access at  power levels sufficient for productive uses, such as  in cottage industries, can also support local employment  and financial well-being (EUEI and GIZ 2011).  In rural or remote regions, renewable electrification  can be more cost effective than conventional  grid extension and, in some situations, may be the  only practical option. In 2010, the International  Energy Agency (IEA) assessment of energy access  suggested that the most cost-effective electrification  for 70 percent of rural, remote areas would be  through off-grid or micro-grid systems, more than  90 percent of which would be powered by renewables  (IEA 2011). For this reason, the IEA suggested  that 64 percent of investment in energy access  would have to go to off-grid and mini-grid solutions  (primarily renewables) if universal energy access  was to be achieved by 2030.  Renewable energy sources could offer long-term  energy security and affordability benefits because  they are insulated from world energy price  increases and volatility. For instance, in Bangladesh,  where 75 percent of rural people lack electricity,  a public-private partnership is offering affordable  solar electric systems for homes (Box 7).  Figure 5 | Key Approaches for Building  Capabilities through Low-Carbon   Upfront costs  Renewables can present lower costs and more  reliable energy than traditional fossil-based electricity  sources, especially in the long run, but they  usually require significant upfront investments  that can limit access, especially to those who  are least well off (IEA 2011). Small-scale energy  entrepreneurs have developed creative financing  for low-income households. Such innovations  have included loans to traditionally “nonbanking”  populations (Box 8), subsidy and loan combinations  and pay-as-you go systems (Omwansa and  Sullivan 2014). Key lessons from such efforts have  included the importance of facilitating finance for  Electricity access has been increasing in Bangladesh, but  roughly 47 percent of the population still lacked access  (Hamid 2012; Urmee, Harries, and Schlapfer 2009; Kabir,  Dey, and Faraby 2010), and roughly 75 percent of people in  rural areas lacked access to energy (Hoque and Das 2013).  Over 80 percent of the country’s electricity is generated  with natural gas, but domestic supplies are insufficient  to meet Bangladesh’s current and growing demand  for energy (Baten et al. 2009). As a result, Bangladesh  imports fossil fuels, the cost of which strains the  country’s foreign reserves (Hamid 2012).  The Infrastructure Development Company Limited  (IDCOL), a public-private entity, initiated a rural  solar energy program, with funding from a variety of  international development agencies, in 2002 (Urmee,  Harries, and Schlapfer 2009; Kabir, Dey, and Faraby  2010). IDCOL works with partner organizations that  interact directly with consumers. IDCOL provides a  small subsidy and loan to partner organizations that,  in turn, extend credit to people who buy their solar  home systems. Partner organizations are incentivized to  ensure their solar home systems are well-built and well-maintained  (Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010; Arc Finance  2014). A typical solar home system costs $155 and  provides enough power for several lights and a television  set (Hamid 2012; Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010). These  systems reduced women’s burdens in the household (for  example, fetching water or cooking became much easier  and less time-consuming with access to electricity). With  time freed from household duties and electricity to light  their homes after dark, women were also able to engage  in income-generating activities such as sewing or poultry  farming (Kabir, Dey, and Faraby 2010; Hoque and Das  2013; Hamid 2012).  Several factors contributed to the success of the  program. These include:  ▪▪International financial support extended not only as  a capital subsidy but also as low-interest loans that  ultimately were extended to consumers.  ▪▪The “incentive structure” of the program, which  ensured effective after-sales service of the systems.  ▪▪Adequate administrative support and oversight from  IDCOL.  ▪▪Affordability of the products to consumers in terms  of total costs and repayment schemes matching the  structure of their income.  ▪▪Successful mobilization of partner social enterprises  that rapidly expanded to reach millions of customers.  BOX 7 | RURAL ELECTRICITY ACCESS  IN BANGLADESH  Selco India, founded in 1995, is a for-profit organization  that aims to provide electricity and, especially, lighting for  India’s rural and urban poor, mostly through photovoltaic  solar power (Selco 2014). Selco uses a no-subsidy  approach in which it helps arrange loans for poor  customers who lack significant savings so they can pay  for their lighting or energy supply themselves. Selco’s  products have benefited over half a million people in more  than 80,000 households and, in 2005, Selco’s revenue  was US$3 million (Bazilian et al. 2012), demonstrating  the long-term viability of its financial model.  In one case, Selco worked with a female entrepreneur  to provide portable lanterns for historically vulnerable  tribes in the Kutch district of Gujarat. The tribes’ location  was too remote for members to take regular long trips to  make loan payments. Instead, one loan to buy lanterns  for all the tribal households was made to a single female  entrepreneur, who then delivered the lanterns and made  payments on the loan (Selco 2014). According to Selco,  it is “essential to leverage the expertise of local financial  institutions to make the initial cost of solar energy  service affordable: not by lowering the capital cost but  by creating financial products that match the cash flow of  the client” (Selco 2014, 4–5).  Selco’s innovative approach to financing is at least  as important as its solar technology (Bazilian et al.  2011; IEA 2011). Selco’s approach to expanding  access to energy, particularly its financing innovations,  demonstrates that it is possible to expand access to  energy, even in remote, rural areas, without accelerating  climate change.  BOX 8 | INNOVATIVE FINANCING FOR  RURAL ELECTRICITY IN INDIA  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up very low-income or seasonally employed workers  (and such facilitation includes capacity building  within financial institutions), and understanding  the finance opportunities of individuals and communities.  Even with these systems, however, reaching  very poor populations remains challenging. For  instance, with pay-as-you-go systems, people living  in poverty face the constant threat of disruptions to  their energy supply.  Some developed countries have started programs to  improve low-income households’ access to renewable  energy systems and employment opportunities.  For example, the California Solar Initiative, which  began in 2006, includes employment training in  renewable energy and installation of renewables for  low-income households (California Public Utilities  Commission 2014) (Box 9) .  Third-party power purchase agreements have been  used to allow households to avoid upfront solar  costs, although these agreements are aimed at consumers  already capable of paying for grid electricity.  Finding ways to address upfront costs can expand  access to the benefits of renewables at both the individual  and national levels (which, in turn, provides  a range of benefits important for individual capabilities,  including improved air quality, energy security,  and long-term price certainty). For example, in  the face of a growing economy and limited domestic  fossil fuel resources, Ghana has been attempting to  expand its renewable energy capacity (Ghana 2011).  This strategy includes developing the 155 megawatt  Nzema concentrated solar power plant. However,  finance has remained challenging and this project  depends on significant overseas investment  (Clover 2014). For countries with limited financial  resources, there is a need for international support  to overcome upfront costs of large-scale renewable  energy deployment.  Colocating renewable energy generation  Renewable energy systems, especially in large-scale  deployments, can have disadvantages, such as noise  from wind farms or the cost of new transmission  lines from areas of high-wind-potential to areas of  high population. Many renewables require large  areas of land, which might be difficult and expensive  to access, and renewable energy installations can  result in habitat loss—for example, in sensitive high-altitude  slopes suitable for wind farms—or competitive  use of agricultural land and water resources; for  example, in areas used for biomass. In many cases,  the communities most impacted by the development  of renewable energy sources are not its final  consumers. These inequities in distribution of the  benefits and burdens of renewables can erode public  support for renewables generation (Devine-Wright  2005; Wolsink 2007). Colocating the production  and use of renewables, wide public engagement, and  ensuring transparent economic benefit sharing from  renewable production can erode some of these equity  concerns. Renewable energy cooperatives represent  an institutional innovation that has been proposed  to connect costs and benefits of large-scale energy  production and help to create a more equitable,  and more publicly acceptable, model of renewable  generation (see Box 10).  The falling cost of solar photovoltaic panels has made  them economically competitive with electricity rates  over the long run in some jurisdictions, and their  installation can result in household economic savings.  As of mid-2011, the majority of Californian residential  solar photovoltaic installations are arranged through  third-party companies in power purchase agreements.  In these agreements, a third party owns and maintains  the solar panels, and households commit to a long-term  electricity price that is either competitive with, or slightly  lower than their current price of electricity from the grid.  These arrangements, and their potential for long-term  household savings, have contributed to a doubling  of installed Californian residential solar photovoltaic  capacity between 2011 and 2013 (EIA 2014a). Power  purchase agreements have allowed a greater diversity  of people—including lower income people traditionally  excluded from such long-term investments—to benefit  from long-term solar power savings, while helping  California meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets.  BOX 9 | SOLAR POWER IN  CALIFORNIA, USA   Equitable public finance to support renewables  The design of public policies to support renewables  can effectively address equity concerns. For example,  feed-in tariffs (FITs) have caused particular  concern because they can cause electricity prices  to rise due to less grid users–but grid infrastructure  costs remaining static. Under a FIT scheme,  producers of renewable sources of electricity are  offered a long-term contract, which typically guarantees  a set price, or a scheduled suite of prices, for  the power they will produce and sell to the electrical  grid. Low-income customers often are more  affected by price increases because energy usually  accounts for a larger proportion of their budgets.  Low-income households, in some cases, also face  higher energy needs because of poor quality housing  and the use of older, less efficient appliances.  One of the important strategies for more equitable  direction of public energy finance is to ensure that  the needs of lowest income and most vulnerable  populations are understood and taken into consideration  during decision-making. This can take the  form of needs-assessment or demand-characterization  studies that specifically identify the most  pressing needs and the resources and opportunities  available to community members (see Box 11).  Wind power has a long history in Denmark, but the  1973 oil crisis stimulated interest in large-scale wind-energy  production (Tranaes n.d.;Mendonça, Lacey, and  Hvelplund 2009). The Danish government supported  cooperatives through policies such as a 30 percent  subsidy for new wind energy projects and feed-in tariff  (FIT) policies (Mendonça, Lacey, and Hvelplund 2009).  Although communities in other countries often  oppose new wind power projects because of visual  and noise impacts, Danish communities have tended  to support them. This is often attributed to the  cooperative ownership structure, which tightens the  relationship between benefits and burdens of renewable  generation, and actively involves communities in energy   decision-making. In a cooperative structure, those who  have to bear the aesthetic and environmental burdens  of wind power also receive financial or energy benefits  from these projects. In addition, individuals have greater  opportunities to participate in  decision-making, which  has reduced tensions about equity and generated wider  support (Devine-Wright 2005; Sørensen, Hansen, and  Larsen 2002).  BOX 10 | DENMARK’S WIND ENERGY  COOPERATIVES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Carbon Pricing  Climate change is partly a result of market failure.  GHG emissions cause negative impacts but the  costs of these impacts are excluded from the markets  that created them. Thus individuals, companies,  and countries have little financial incentive to  reduce their emissions. Carbon pricing attempts to  remedy this situation by assigning a price to GHG  emissions, typically either through a carbon tax or  by creating a cap-and-trade market.  Carbon pricing can aid mitigation and, if well  designed, can provide positive benefits for consumers  (Preston et al. 2013). There is a large potential  for increased use of carbon pricing as a strategy for  achieving emission reductions and the associated  monetary and non-monetary co-benefits (World  Bank and EcoFys 2013).  Carbon Pricing, Co-benefits, and Capabilities  Carbon pricing shifts the incentive structure for  routine economic decisions to support the mitigation  efforts that will be required to protect long-term  capabilities. As greenhouse gases tend to be emitted  along with other pollutants, reducing emissions can  also improve air quality and human health, which  also contribute to human well-being. Low-income  residents are particularly susceptible to poor air  quality because many live near polluting industries,  and because the health care costs of air pollution may  be relatively more onerous. Environmental justice  studies have consistently found that marginalized  communities tend to have higher exposure to industrial  pollutants, and are less likely to be meaningfully  involved in local  decision-making about facilities siting  or management (Cole and Foster 2001; Bullard 1997).  Carbon pricing can also create benefits beyond climate  change mitigation and improved air quality. Increased  energy costs have systematically been linked to higher  economy-wide energy efficiency (Grubb 2014). Over  time, higher energy efficiency leads to significant  savings. For instance, the Regional Greenhouse Gas  Initiative trading scheme among power plants in the  northeastern United States is expected to save the  region over $2 billion in lifetime energy costs (RGGI  2014). Increased efficiency can also help reduce  national vulnerability to fuel-price volatility, a particular  concern for many developing countries.  Carbon pricing, either as a tax or as a permit  auction, can also generate government revenue  for other national priorities. For example, the  US$1.7 billion in auction revenues generated by the  Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the United  States since 2008 has funded energy efficiency and  clean technology development, and reduced customers’  electricity bills (RGGI 2014). In California,  auction revenues support a range of services including  community development and public transportation  (California 2014). Similarly, the carbon tax  in Ireland (Box 12) has allowed the government  to minimize increases in income or employment  taxes, which tend to slow economic recovery, while  increasing resources for low-income residents  (Convery, Dunne, and Joyce 2013).  Facing a predicted doubling of energy demand within  20 years (Chrometzka 2014) and limited domestic fossil  fuel resources, Thailand was one of the first Asian  countries to pursue renewable energy development. In  2013, the country unveiled one of the region’s most  ambitious solar photovoltaic targets, aiming to produce  3,000 megawatts by 2021 (TSRM2013). Thailand initially  included a feed-in tariff (FIT) featuring a generous  premium for renewable energy, but this proved so  attractive that it created a “solar gold rush” and more  proposed capacity than expected. The Ministry of Energy  became concerned that, if the government’s official target  of 500 megawatts were to be exceeded, there would be a  sharp increase in the pass-through costs to consumers  (Graecen and Tongsopit 2013).  To rebalance its policy and better direct the benefits of  solar power generation to individual households and  communities who had initially been excluded from the  policy’s benefits, the new FIT design includes explicit  rates and targets both for residential rooftop solar, and  community photovoltaic systems. Aims of this program  include greater residential income-sharing benefits, in  addition to higher employment and community financial  benefits. Financing was provided through the Thai Village  Fund (Tongsopit 2014; Chrometzka 2014). Extending  the policy to the community was particularly designed to  help individuals who could benefit only by participating  as members of a group; the policy redesign demonstrated  a strong desire to address some equity concerns of the  original policy. However, funding, especially for the  low-interest loans initially included in the community  projects, has presented an ongoing challenge, and has  slowed the roll-out of the program (TSRM 2014).  BOX 11 | FEED-IN-TARIFF IN THAILAND   Strategies for Equitable Carbon Pricing  Carbon pricing policies can have negative effects on  the poor but, with careful design, they can achieve  progressive impacts.  Minimizing regressive impacts  Carbon pricing tends to increase energy prices,  creating some equity challenges. People with lower  incomes typically use less energy, but energy expenditures  usually constitute a larger proportion of their  budgets. Fortunately, carbon pricing need not be  regressive. For instance, British Columbia’s carbon  tax provided income tax reductions to low-income  residents to compensate them for increased energy  prices (British Columbia 2009). A variety of compensation  schemes can be used to make carbon pricing  result in progressive outcomes (Preston et al. 2013).  Companies may also face unequal difficulties in the  face of carbon pricing schemes. A common challenge,  especially in some developing countries, is  that energy entities can have a wide range of operating  efficiencies. India’s energy efficiency policy for  industry assigned plant-specific targets, encouraging  a process of long-term, system-wide efficiency  gains without threatening local employment and  development (Box 13).  In late 2008, Ireland suffered a severe fiscal crisis and  negotiated a bailout with the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund. As part of its austerity  measures, Ireland dramatically reduced expenditures and  raised taxes. Ireland imposed a carbon tax of €15 per  metric ton of CO2 on transport fuels in late 2009 and then  extended this tax to nontransport liquid fuels in 2010.  In 2012, the tax increased to €20 per metric ton of CO2  (Gargan 2012).  Between 2010 and 2012, the cumulative revenue  from Ireland’s carbon tax was €919 million. Although  revenue from the tax provided only about 1 percent  of the government’s tax revenues, it constituted 12.4  percent of the increase in tax revenues demanded by  the austerity agreements over this period (Convery,  Dunne, and Joyce 2013). The carbon tax allowed the  government to minimize increases in labor and income  taxes and helped protect the economy and citizens from  austerity measures. To address fuel poverty and equity  concerns, the government set aside revenues to expand  weatherization and energy efficiency programs for lowincome  residents (Convery, Dunne, and Joyce 2013).  Populations who were considered especially vulnerable  to price increases, and who had limited alternative  options (for example, farmers) were given partial relief  from their tax liability.  BOX 12 | IRELAND’S CARBON TAX  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Carbon pricing can generate economic benefits –  including government revenue – that can be used to  secure progressive outcomes. Revenue from carbon  pricing can be used to reduce other specific taxes,  or to reduce general taxation to spur aggregate  economic growth (Sumner, Bird, and Smith 2009).  Revenues can also be directed to communities with  particular needs, in the form of cash transfers or inkind  provisions (for example, public transit or community  development). The California cap-and-trade  system (Box 14) explicitly sets aside 25 percent of the  revenue to be used to benefit disadvantaged communities,  almost half of which (10 percent of total  revenues) must be invested directly in these communities  while the rest can be used for investments  elsewhere that benefit the community residents. This  has resulted in investments in public transportation,  local development, and weatherization for lowincome  residents’ housing (California 2014).  India’s Perform, Achieve, and Trade (PAT) scheme, conceived  in 2008 and implemented in 2011, is the first market-based  energy-efficiency trading scheme in a developing country  (Singh 2013). The Indian government established the PAT  scheme to improve energy security, reduce energy deficits,  and make India’s industries more competitive.  In the 478 facilities it covers, the scheme aims to reduce  energy consumption by 4.8 percent, equivalent to about  6.6 million metric tons of oil (Diddi 2011; Singh 2013).  Each facility receives an energy-consumption-reduction  target. Each entity receives tradable-energy-savings  credits if it achieves reductions beyond its target, and  those that fall short must buy credits to make up the  difference (Bureau of Energy Efficiency 2011).  Two relevant issues with equity implications are that  industrial entities across India vary substantially in their  energy efficiency, and employment is always of concern.  Based on extensive workshops, meetings, and stakeholder  consultations, it was decided to give each plant a unique  energy-efficiency target based on its baseline energy  usage to avoid severe hardship, and potential shutdown.  A large number of national consultants were trained and  supported to gather energy-use data from all plants. One  important benefit of this scheme from a national capability  perspective has been greater domestic capacity in energy-efficiency  monitoring (Singh 2013).  From a capabilities perspective this case is interesting  both because of the extensive efforts made to include  stakeholders’ perspectives about policy implications,  and the way in which the specific circumstances of  each installation were taken into account. Given the  context of large variations in efficiency, the approach  facilitated broad participation and attempted to limit  targets that might have resulted in undesirable impacts  for capabilities, such as sudden employment losses.  Conversely, it remains possible that some communities  will continue to face burdens from local air pollution  associated with lower efficiency plants. It will be  necessary to see how both efficiencies and community  impacts change over time.  BOX 13 | INDIA’S PERFORM, ACHIEVE,  AND TRADE SCHEME  The U.S. State of California aims to reduce its GHG  emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In 2006, California  passed the Global Warming Solutions Act, which  required the state to develop a scoping plan for  emission reductions, identify and monitor statewide  GHGs, establish a market-based system to achieve GHG  reductions, create an economic and technical board, and  create an environmental justice advisory board (California  2006). Based on its scoping plan, the state chose to use a  cap-and-trade system to drive emission reductions.  Initially, the California system was second only to the  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme in terms  of the quantity of total emissions covered, though it  has since been overtaken by the aggregate emissions  coverage of China’s five trading systems (Song and  Lei 2014). The California system is designed to reduce  emissions by 16 percent between 2013 and 2020  (California 2011). The program covers approximately 394  million tons of CO2, which represents approximately 85  percent of California’s total CO2 emissions.  Partly due to the advocacy of the environmental justice  community, and the inclusion of an environmental justice  advisory board, California’s cap-and-trade program  now aims to protect local communities’ well-being. It  requires that at least 25 percent of revenues be invested  in projects that benefit disadvantaged communities,  a portion of which must be spent directly in these  communities (California 2012). Examples include  investments in public transit, weatherization for lowincome  residents’ housing, and advances in freight  management to decrease local air pollution from freight  hubs (California 2014).  BOX 14 | CALIFORNIA’S GLOBAL  WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT   Distributing Nonmonetary Co-benefits  Carbon pricing can also lead to nonmonetary  co-benefits. Some benefits, such as reduced air  pollution and improved human health, emerge as  byproducts of lower emissions, but permit systems  can also be designed so that certain developments  or social benefits are built into the definition of  permits or offsets. For example, several pricing  schemes have defined credits or offsets to include  a range of development criteria. Some of these  schemes exist in the voluntary carbon market (Gold  Standard 2013), the Clean Development Mechanism,  and REDD+.1 In all these cases, permits or  offsets were explicitly defined to include social and/  or environmental benefits (Mathur et al. 2014).  Fossil-Fuel Subsidy Reform  Fossil-fuel subsidies lead to higher GHG emissions  and divert resources away from development priorities.  According to the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), all countries subsidize fossil fuels, although  the form and size of subsidies vary considerably  (IMF 2013, 201). The International Energy Agency  (IEA) estimates that global pretax subsidies for  the production and consumption of fossil fuels are  Two general types of fossil-fuel subsidy are pretax  subsidies and tax subsidies. Pretax subsidies are typically  consumer subsidies that reduce the price of fossil fuels  directly. They are commonly measured by comparing  domestic fossil-fuel prices to international fossil-fuel  prices. Using this method, the International Energy  Agency (IEA) estimated global subsidies at $523 billion  in 2011 (IEA 2012). Pretax subsidies are widely used,  particularly in developing countries, to protect domestic  consumers from high or volatile world energy prices.  Tax subsidies are common in producer states, including  many developed countries, and often aim to support  domestic oil and gas sectors. Tax subsidies are typically  located upstream from direct consumers and can include  a wide range of actions including in-kind support of  oil and gas exploration, or accelerated depreciation for  equipment or assets to minimize corporate tax liabilities.  Tax subsidies can be more difficult to measure than  pretax subsidies because they are more diverse and  because the cost of tax subsidies includes broader fiscal  implications of inefficient taxation. For example, a pretax  subsidy calculation would not include the negative  impacts of pollution, but a tax subsidy would. In a 2013  International Monetary Fund study, the calculation for  tax subsidies includes a US$25 per tonne of carbon  emission as the social cost of carbon. When such  impacts are included, the overall cost of tax and pretax  subsidies is enormous—over $1.9 trillion in 2011  by one estimate, or roughly 8 percent of total global  government revenue (IMF 2013).  Because fossil-fuel subsidies take many forms,  transparent measurement is extremely difficult, and data  are missing for many countries (OECD 2011). Many  governments do not have accurate information about  their own fossil-fuel subsidies (IMF 2013; IEA 2011).  It is even less likely that citizens and communities are  aware of the costs of subsidies. Based on the idea that  understanding subsidies increases public support for  reforming them, several attempts at subsidy reform have  featured public communication strategies. By extension,  improving international transparency about subsidies  should support national efforts to reform subsidies  (Victor 2009a; OECD 2011).  BOX 15 | THE CHALLENGES OF  MEASURING FOSSIL-FUEL SUBSIDIES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up approximately $523 billion annually (IEA 2012).  This figure is conservative and it could be much  higher, depending on how subsidies are measured.  The IEA also estimated that global removal of  pretax fossil-fuel subsidies would reduce global CO2  emissions by approximately 2 gigatons, or 4 percent  of total emissions, annually (IEA 2012).  In 2009, leaders in the Group of 20 (G-20) committed  to gradually phasing out subsidies but recognized  that poor communities might still need assistance  (G-20 2009). In 2011, the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation leaders followed suit and additionally  promised to establish a voluntary reporting system  for fossil-fuel subsidies (APEC 2011).  Fossil-Fuel Subsidies and Capabilities  Fossil-fuel subsidies are important from a capabilities  perspective because of their economy-wide  effects and impacts on fossil-fuel use.  Fossil-fuel subsidies divert money from development  Fossil-fuel subsidies divert resources from other  national priorities. For instance, Yemen’s government  spent over 20 percent of its budget on  fossil-fuel subsidies in 2009—more than it spent on  education, health, and social protection programs  combined (Breisinger, Engelke, and Ecker 2011).  Similarly, at the peak of global energy prices in  2008, Indonesia’s government spent roughly 22  percent of its budget on consumer-oriented fossil-fuel  subsidies (Mourougane 2010).  The most vulnerable members of society are likely  to be the most dependent on public services in the  face of climate change, so reduced public support  for services like education, affordable public transit,  and health care affects them—and their core capabilities—  particularly strongly. At the same time,  without clear increases in public supports and cash  transfers, and active engagement of the public, subsidy  removal is difficult because it can be seen as an  erosion of support for the poor. Development and  capabilities benefits must be apparent in subsidy  reforms if they are to be successful. In Indonesia,  attempts to eliminate energy subsidies raised strong  opposition for many years (Box 16). Conversely, in  Iran, a broad public communications campaign was  a crucial element of the reform process (Box 17).  Subsidies benefit middle- and upper-income  people most  Although subsidies are often implemented to protect  the well-being of the poor, middle- and upper-income  people have benefited most from fossil-fuel  subsidies. One study of fossil-fuel subsidies in 20  countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin  America found that only US$3 out of every US$100  reached the poorest 20 percent of the population  (Arze del Granado, Coady, and Gillingham 2012).  Indonesia first attempted fossil-fuel subsidy reforms  after the 1997 Asian crisis, but the reforms were too  sudden and sweeping, resulting in widespread political  unrest (Beaton and Lontoh 2010). From 2000 to 2003,  the Indonesian government continued its attempts to  reduce subsidies, but problems with the compensation  mechanisms and widespread political mistrust eroded  public support. In 2005, the government attempted to  reform subsidies again. The 2005 reform included a  cash-transfer program, increased access to health care  for poor households, and reduced school fees. Subsidies  to large, industrial electricity consumers were also  stopped (IMF 2013). However, even after these reforms,  subsidies still cost Indonesia about 4.5 percent of its  GDP. The remaining subsidies are regressive, and they  have eroded utilities’ ability to invest in electrification and  other upgrades. This failure continues to contribute to  energy access challenges, particularly in remote island  areas (Chung 2013; Mourougane 2010).  New reforms were initiated in 2008, along with cash  transfers, a food-security program, and support for  education (Beaton and Lontoh 2010). However, by  2013, government spending on energy subsidies was  again greater than its spending on health, education,  housing, environmental protection, and social protection  combined (Chung 2013), so the government initiated  another round of reforms (EIA 2014b). Modeling  has suggested that fully removing subsidies could  dramatically increase GDP and reduce poverty  (Mourougane 2010). Although phasing out subsidies  remains a work in progress, Indonesia joined other G-20  countries in their pledge to achieve this goal. This case  highlights the challenges of national subsidy reform:  public acceptance and support is crucial and may be best  generated through active involvement.  BOX 16 | INDONESIA’S ATTEMPTS TO  PHASE OUT SUBSIDIES   These disparities across income groups hold even  when the indirect benefits of lower fuel prices,  such as lower food costs, are considered (Arze del  Granado, Coady, and Gillingham 2012). This suggests  that, while energy subsidies are often justified  to protect the poor, other strategies would actually  make more effective use of limited resources.  The inequities inherent in fossil-fuel subsidies are  easily observed: for example, over 44 percent of  the money spent on petroleum-product subsidies  in Africa goes to the top quintile, only 7 percent  reaches the poorest quintile (Coady et al. 2010).  However, although the poor gain relatively little  from direct subsidies, the small benefit that subsidies  provide remains crucial to them, especially if  subsidies are targeted at cooking fuels such as kerosene.  Additionally, the poor may be more dependent  on public services, which, in turn, are eroded  by the diversion of limited government revenues to  fossil-fuel subsidies. Many countries that remove  subsidies have tried to minimize the negative consequences  of higher energy prices for low-income  families by using cash-transfers or improving public  services such as education or health care.  Fossil-fuel subsidies impede energy efficiency and  long-term growth  Fossil-fuel subsidies can reduce energy efficiency  and impede long-term growth. In parts of Sub-  Saharan Africa, electricity production costs are  extremely high and suppliers are often unable to  fully recoup investments because of subsidized  prices. Over time, this has led to insufficient investment  in electricity infrastructure, which has exacerbated  ongoing challenges to energy access, growth,  and employment (IMF 2013). High subsidies also  lead to energy inefficiency because prices are too  low to encourage efficiency improvements or infrastructure  reinvestments. High subsidies and inefficiency  have been ongoing challenges in the Middle  East and North Africa (Fattouh and El-Katiri 2013).  In fossil-fuel producing countries, subsidies lead to  artificially low prices that can contribute to higher  domestic consumption and foregone government revenue  because fuel is consumed domestically instead of  being exported. For example, Iran has become a net  importer of gasoline (Hessari 2005), in part because  of its high levels of subsidy and low levels of efficiency.  Because domestic prices are subsidized, the country  generates less revenue through domestic sales than  they would if the same fuel were exported to the international  market. Instead of generating revenue, gasoline  imports have imposed a heavy financial burden  on Iran, leaving less revenue for investments in other  areas essential to capabilities. In general, evidence is  growing that fossil-fuel subsidies impede long-term  growth; studies of post-subsidy reform periods show  higher rates of economic growth (Breisinger, Engelke,  and Ecker 2011).  The Iranian case exemplifies a careful effort to  protect well-being and long-term capabilities at the  individual level during a major reform of fossil-fuel  subsidies. The need for strong communications and  banking systems were highlighted to facilitate such  profound reforms.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Low-Carbon Transportation Planning  Nearly all people depend on access to transportation  to achieve a range of capabilities. Sustainable  transportation policies can provide numerous  benefits, simultaneously reducing carbon dioxide  and other air pollutant emissions, reducing poverty,  improving public health, and enhancing the  overall resilience and adaptability of communities  in the face of climate change. Increasing mobility  and reducing CO2 emissions need not be mutually  exclusive goals; well-coordinated policies can lead  to both low-carbon transitions in the transportation  sector and greater access to mobility services.  Transportation and Capabilities  A lack of mobility can reduce access to education,  livelihoods, health care, public participation  and social engagement, to name just a few of  the capabilities at stake. For vulnerable groups,  especially the poor, the lack of access to a reliable,  efficient, and affordable means of transportation is  a serious burden. Transportation was the second  largest source of CO2 emissions worldwide in 2012,  accounting for almost a quarter of global CO2 emissions  from fuel consumption (IEA 2013b). Carbon  dioxide emissions from transportation are growing  at an average rate of 1.7 percent per year and,  In 2010, Iran embarked on the first  major subsidy-reform program  undertaken by an oil-exporting  country. In 2008, the price of domestic  (subsidized) gasoline was only 5  percent of the unsubsidized world price  (Guillaume, Farzin, and Zytek 2011).  As international oil prices skyrocketed,  high domestic consumption resulted  in lost export revenues and domestic  production companies could barely  cover their operating costs, let alone  invest in efficiency improvements.  The 2010 Reform Act caused dramatic  increases in retail prices for all energy  sources (Guillaume, Farzin, and Zytek  2011). A sevenfold price increase for  petrol occurred overnight (See Table  B17.3 for details). Initially, 50 percent  of the revenues received through the  reform were earmarked to compensate  households. Each household received  a designated bank account with a  cash-transfer deposited in it before  the price increase was announced.  Simultaneously, the government spread  information about the subsidy reform,  and, to deter hoarding, the government  publicized its stockpile of fuel that could  be released into the market if necessary.  Despite the detailed planning, the  Iranian reforms have faced significant  challenges. It proved difficult to identify  low-income households accurately  and almost 80 percent of households  received cash transfers, resulting in  reduced revenue for the government.  High inflation has since reduced the  value of cash transfers, especially  for Iran’s poorest (Hassanzadeh  2012). A more targeted cash-transfer  compensation program has been  planned to help the least well off.  following a business-as-usual scenario, are projected  to increase by 70 percent by 2050 (United  Nations 2013). Most of this increase is projected  to come from developing countries, where rising  vehicle ownership has increased CO2 emissions  from transportation by over 60 percent between  2000 and 2012 (United Nations 2013).  Rapid growth in automobile use has contributed to  an estimated 1.24 million deaths per year. In 2012,  road traffic fatalities were the leading cause of death  for young people aged 15–29 and the eighth leading  cause of death overall (WHO 2013). Cars and trucks  emit fine particulate pollution, sulfur dioxide, black  carbon, and other toxins (United Nations 2013). In  the United States, for instance, levels of pollutants  tend to be highest in low-income areas and children  and the elderly are especially at risk from adverse  health effects or death as a result of air pollution  (Clark, Millet, and Marshall 2014).  Rapid growth in private vehicle use and poorly  designed roads and public transportation systems  have also led to congestion problems in major cities  around the world (United Nations 2013). It has been  estimated that congestion cost an estimated US$101  billion globally in lost productivity and decreased  fuel efficiency in 2010 (Replogle and Hughes 2012).  Enhancing Capabilities through Low-Carbon  Transportation  Increasing access to transportation is important  to combating poverty and providing people with  the means to seek better economic opportunities,  but greater access cannot be achieved simply by  building more roads. Poorly managed transportation  systems can create health and safety risks for  the people they are meant to serve, especially for  lower income groups and other vulnerable populations.  The traditional approach of building more  roads and optimizing the movement of vehicles, as  opposed to people and goods, has led to the exclusion  of large groups of people (United Nations  2013). For many developed and rapidly developing  countries, the costs created by carbon-intensive  growth of the transportation sector have been damaging,  especially in the cities where growth is centered.  Increasing levels of motorization are harmful  not only to public health, economic growth, and  overall well-being but also to the climate system.  A low-carbon transportation sector focused on public  transit offers a way to increase transportation—  including for the poor—while avoiding the short  and long-term negative implications of increased  transportation emissions, road traffic accidents, and  air pollutants. Several strategies have been pursued  to achieve these aims.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Increasing appropriate public transit  To curb motorization, especially in rapidly developing  countries where both population and personal  wealth are on the rise, a practical and attractive  alternative to private vehicles must be available.  Some national and local governments are choosing  to reform their transportation sectors through  policies that encourage public transportation use,  limit the number of cars on the roads, support  greater mobility and access for low-income and  other marginalized groups, and create a safer and  more pleasant travelling experience for everyone on  the roads.  For instance, the bus rapid transit system in  Bogota, Colombia (Box 18) has reduced air pollution,  increased public transportation availability  especially for lower-middle income groups, reduced  transportation health and safety impacts, and  resulted in economic benefits. An additional benefit  of a bus rapid transit system is that it can be more  cost-effective than rail-based systems.  Appropriate pricing and policy signals  Another strategy for supporting low-carbon transportation  development is to change underlying  price structures and planning processes to discourage  the growth of fossil-fuel based motorization.  Such efforts can include explicit planning and landuse  policies that prioritize low-carbon development  or mechanisms such as congestion charges that can  result in a range of benefits. For example, Istanbul’s  decision to pedestrianize part of its historic core  resulted in decreased pollution but also contributed  to economic growth from tourism.  In the United Kingdom, a congestion charge  imposed on the central zone of London almost  immediately resulted in a range of benefits: congestion,  air pollution, emissions, and traffic accidents  all decreased (Box 19). This policy also generated  income, which supported public transit systems  that are used particularly by low-income communities.  This policy shift required minimal public  investment, but did require a strong policy framework  and relied on widespread public engagement  and support.  Bogota’s bus rapid transit (BRT) system, TransMilenio,  is an example of how low-carbon transportation  development can have positive impacts, both on GHG  emissions and on the lives of a city’s residents. With  an estimated population of over 8 million in 2007,  and a high population density, Bogota suffered from  heavily congested roadways, high traffic fatalities, long  commuting times, and severe air pollution (Turner,  Kooshian, and Winkelman 2012). In conjunction with  restrictions on car traffic and improved bicycling  infrastructure, Bogota implemented the TransMilenio  system to address these issues. A benefit of using a  bus rapid transit was that it could be implemented less  expensively than a comparable rail system.  This system has a daily ridership of 2 million people, and  is the primary source of transportation for 30 percent  of Bogota’s residents (Bogotá Cómo Vamos 2013). The  improved fuel economy of TransMilenio buses has also  resulted in a 43 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2)  an 18 percent reduction in nitric oxide and nitrogen  dioxide (NOx), and a 12 percent reduction in particulate  matter. Traffic injuries along the TransMilenio corridor  were reduced by almost 40 percent and traffic fatalities  were reduced by almost 50 percent compared with the  pre-BRT system (Carrigan et al. 2013). Faster buses  have contributed to a 32 percent decrease in travel time  relative to the pre-BRT system for users (Echeverry,  Ibanez, and Hillon 2004). The areas around the BRT  corridor have benefited from increased property values  and an 85 percent reduction in crime relative to the pre-  BRT system because of increased lighting and security  measures (Carrigan et al. 2013).  A 2013 analysis by EMBARQ found that lower-income  residents most benefitted from the BRT, and ridership  on the TransMilenio tends to be highest in lower-middle  income groups (Carrigan et al. 2013). Feeder buses  provide low-income neighborhoods with access to main  trunk lines (Carrigan et al. 2013). However, the fare  remains too expensive for many of Bogota’s low-income  residents. The Bogota government has considered  subsidizing the fare price to make TransMilenio more  practical for poorer residents, but instead provided a  discounted fare during off-peak hours. This decision  may help alleviate overcrowding during peak hours  (Hutchinson 2011), but does not address the core equity  concern of access for low-income riders facing temporal  limits to affordable mobility.  BOX 18 | BOGOTA’S BUS RAPID TRANSIT   Community Forestry Management  Reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by  deforestation and forest degradation is central to  climate change mitigation. More than 13 million  hectares of forest are cleared every year, and forest  loss and degradation are the source of 12 percent  of all GHG emissions (Smith et al. 2014). Integrating  forest management into climate policy action is  an important mitigation strategy. However, access  to forest benefits and meaningful engagement in  forestry  decision-making is essential for ensuring  the capabilities of current and future forest  communities. When designed well, forestry and  climate policy can enhance the capabilities of  forest-dependent communities.  Forests and Capabilities  As sources of livelihoods, food, energy, spiritual  health, and shelter, as well as ecosystem services  such as water and climate regulation, forests are  essential to the capabilities of forest-dependent  communities directly as well as to many others indirectly.  The capabilities of those directly or indirectly  connected to forests depend on access to forest  benefits including timber and non-timber goods and  services. In addition, for those living in and around  forests, meaningful legal, political, social, and  economic engagement in forest management is a  core capability linked to social and political human  rights. Participation is also a central strategy to  achieve the range of other capabilities supported by  access to forest benefits.  The importance of forest health to human capabilities  extends beyond forest boundaries. For example,  over 90 percent of Ethiopians rely on wood for fuel.  By the early 2000s, fuelwood scarcity caused by  deforestation had resulted in increased used of animal  dung for fuel, with resulting decreases in agricultural  productivity (Bishaw and Abdelkadir 2003).  Household use of animal dung for fuel has also been  linked to negative health impacts from indoor air  pollution (Mudway et al. 2005). In addition, the  health of regional watersheds is essential for the  well-being of rural and urban populations—including  those along the Amazon, the Nile, and the Mekong—  and is intimately tied to forest vitality. In addition,  forests act as a global sink for CO2 emissions (or as a  source, in the case of deforestation and degradation);  forest health and regeneration are therefore key elements  in climate mitigation and protection of a wide  range of future capabilities.  Enhancing Capabilities and Climate Action  through Community Forestry  The close relationships between community capabilities,  forest health, and  decision-making authority  led to a widespread interest in community forestry  and indigenous peoples’ rights that started in the  1970s and 1980s. Led by efforts in countries such  as Brazil, Nepal, the Philippines, and India, it was  Long travelling times, air pollution, noise, and high rates  of traffic accidents were creating significant problems for  Londoners. In 2003, the City of London implemented a  congestion-pricing scheme within central London. Any  vehicle entering the congestion area during peak hours  is charged a fee. The fee was initially set at £5 and has  since increased to £11.50 to compete with rising public  transportation costs. Prior to implementation, the city  government established demonstration projects, held  public discussions, and publicized information about the  charge on television and in newspapers.  By 2005, traffic in central London had decreased by 20  percent and congestion was reduced by 30 percent, with  as many as 70,000 fewer vehicles within the congestion  area relative to the precongestion tax period (Willumsen  2004). An estimated 50–60 percent of drivers switched  to public transportation, 20–30 percent avoided the area,  and others switched to carpooling and bicycles (Sadler  n.d.). Journey times were reported to have decreased  by 14 percent (Beevers and Carslaw 2005; Transport for  London 2004). Meanwhile, CO2 emissions decreased  by almost 20 percent, and particulate matter and NOx  decreased by 12 percent (Beevers and Carslaw 2005). Bus  activity increased within the area but, thanks to improved  fuel economy in London’s new buses, emission levels did  not increase correspondingly (Anas and Lindsey 2011).  About half the revenue from the scheme is used to  improve public transportation, a service of particular  importance to low-income groups (Road Traffic  Technology n.d.). Early proposals to implement a carbon-emissions  pricing scheme that included a £25 charge for  high-emitting vehicles were rejected because the scheme  would have had the greatest negative impact on families  and small businesses (Tarry 2008).  BOX 19 | LONDON’S CONGESTION  PRICING SCHEME  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up argued that strengthening community forest rights  not only helps communities flourish by recognizing  their customary rights to forests that they depend  on, but also helps reduce deforestation and forest  degradation. This theory has largely been borne  out; it appears that community forestry both  enhances community capabilities and mitigates  climate change, provided that the community  enjoys strong legal rights that are supported and  protected by governments. Evidence from studies in  Africa, Latin America, and Asia suggests that forests  are healthiest when communities retain management  authority over them (Blomley 2013; Hayes  and Persha 2010; Persha, Agarwal, and Chhatre  2011). Several strategies have been used to increase  capabilities and forest health, avoid emissions, and  store carbon through community forestry.  Legal Rights to Forests for Communities  Protecting forests by strengthening the rights of forest  communities has been a central concern of forest  communities in South America, Southeast Asia, and  Africa. Evidence from a number of countries suggests  that strengthening those legal protections can be vital  both for enhancing equity and for mitigating climate  change. For example, in Brazil, forest loss is significantly  lower in legally recognized indigenous forests  than outside them (RRI 2014) (Box 20). Similarly,  recognition of legal land rights has been a crucial element  in recent reforestation and community development  successes in Ethiopia and Niger (RRI 2014).  A recent study measuring forest carbon in Asia and  Africa found that carbon storage in 30 community  forests increased by 4.9 metric tons per hectare per  year (on average) over three to four years (Skutsch  and Solis 2011). Yet communities currently have  official rights to only about one eighth of the world’s  forests (RRI 2014).  In Brazil, forests hold more than 63 billion metric tons of  carbon, much of it stored in community forests, including  legally recognized indigenous community forests (FAO  2010). Twenty-eight percent of Brazilian forest cover is  government-recognized community forest (RRI 2014).  Although several different types of legal rights for forest  communities are recognized under Brazilian law, by far  the largest legal category by area, is that of “Indigenous  Lands,” more than 300 of which have been legally  recognized (Davis 2013). In Indigenous Lands, resident  indigenous peoples have the legal right to manage the  forest, exclude outsiders, and benefit sustainably. Forest  loss has been 0.7 percent within Indigenous Lands  compared with 7 percent outside them. From 2000–12,  27 times more CO2 emissions were produced outside  Indigenous Lands than within them (Stevens et al. 2014).    Indigenous Lands  Brazilian Amazon  Highlighted Area (see left)  FOREST COVER AND DENSITY (2000)  Closed forests (canopy cover >45%)  Open forests (canopy cover 25-45%)  Woodlands (canopy cover <25%)  Figure 5 | Satellite-Detected Tree Cover Loss in Brazil, 2000-12, for Indigenous Lands in the  Southwest of the Brazilian Amazon  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Legal protections may also be needed to recognize  the use-rights of communities to benefit from forest  management. For instance, in Niger, the forest  service stopped fining farmers who cut branches or  otherwise managed trees on their farms, permitted  farmers to harvest and sell timber from their  trees, and allowed farmers to prevent others from  cutting trees (WRI 2008). This legal change facilitated  Niger’s forest protection process. It has been  demonstrated repeatedly that the right to use or  harvest forest resources incentivizes communities  to manage their forests sustainably (Seymour, La  Vina, and Hite 2014).  Supporting reforestation  Reforesting degraded or deforested land offers  substantial climate change mitigation benefits, and  could directly increase capabilities of communities  in the area. The benefits of reforestation have long  been acknowledged, but policy efforts have not  always been successful and communities have not  always had the right incentives to empower them to  undertake restoration.  An example of this emerges from Ethiopia.  Ethiopia’s forests once covered 30 percent of  the country’s land area but, by 2000, only 4 percent  remained forested (Forest Trends 2013).  In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government offered  communities food for planting trees, but this  approach proved ineffective partly because locals  viewed reforestation as a punishment rather  than an opportunity. When the government was  overthrown, deforestation accelerated as people  attempted to secure short-term economic gains  from cutting down trees (Jones 2010).  More recently, the Ethiopian government has  worked with nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs), corporations, and the United Nations to  protect and restore the country’s forests, while  enhancing the livelihoods of those who rely on  them. By empowering local agropastoralists to  secure their access and land rights, communities  were given a more powerful incentive to protect the  trees on their property (SOS Sahel 2008).  In addition to greater recognition of land-use  rights, successful projects have also involved opportunities  for local people to access resources—such  as seedlings or specialized knowledge—that can  generate long-term community benefits. Ethiopia’s  successful reforestation program included training  for raising cash crop trees (for example, Australian  eucalyptus, apple trees, and coffee trees), and using  a crop calendar to enable year-round harvests (Ministry  of Agriculture and Rural Development 2010;  Jones 2010).  Supporting local management  Community forestry is explicitly built on recognition  of the importance of local management and   decision-making for forest management. A remaining  challenge, however, has been the limited  resources of local communities to fully assume  management. In some situations, there may be  incomplete devolution of authority, while, in others,  communities may lack training or adequate  In Niger, policies that focused on farmers’ right to  manage trees on cropland have led to widescale  reforestation. Historically, communities in Niger held  customary rights to manage trees and forest resources.  However, under colonial legal regimes, national  policies and forest regulations placed trees under  government ownership (including trees in cultivated  fields). Government ownership of trees discouraged  communities from managing them sustainably.  Beginning in the 1980s, Niger started strengthening  community land and forest rights. Niger updated its Rural  Code to recognize community land rights and provided  training. Deforestation halted and reversed as farmers  protected or planted roughly 200 million trees on 5  million hectares of land (WRI 2008).  Niger’s policies have benefited farmers and bolstered  their capabilities. Farmers’ ability to steward their natural  resources and enhance their livelihoods has grown  significantly. According to one estimate, the policies  and programs undertaken in Niger have generated  about US$900 million in annual economic benefits  (Stevens et al. 2014). Community land rights policies  reduced greenhouse gas emissions as well. Farmers’  tree protection and planting has sequestered at least  30 million metric tons of carbon over the past 30 years    resources for long-term management (Charnley  and Poe 2007). As demonstrated in the case of  Guatemala’s community forest concessions (Box  22), communities have had to learn how to sustainably  manage timber and nontimber aspects of  the forests for commercial use, which has proven  difficult (Taylor 2010). Unequal access to training,  community resources, and existing power dynamics  can also contribute to uneven benefit sharing  within community forest systems. In Guatemala,  this challenge confronted some community concessions,  particularly those composed of new residents  from other parts of the country (Charnley and Poe  2007). Careful attention to the provision of training,  management capacity, and other resources is  an important part of successfully supporting community  forestry.  Key lessons for community forestry can also be  taken from Australia’s experience in supporting  Indigenous peoples in traditional management of  savanna land (Box 23). Encouraging traditional  management methods and empowering communities  through well-designed incentives can result in  emissions reductions, and provide an ongoing and  independent source of income that allows the community  to assume full management responsibility.  International Policy Strategies for  Supporting Low-Carbon Pathways  Numerous opportunities exist to pursue low-carbon  pathways while building capabilities. Many of these  opportunities are at the national or local levels, but  could be encouraged and supported through international  action. This section draws on examples  from the previous sections and recommends ways in  which the international community could support  these efforts. Because of overlaps among some of  Guatemala’s contribution to global greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions is relatively small, but the country has  established climate-change mitigation goals (Ministerio  de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2009). Conversion  of forest land to agricultural uses is a large source of  Guatemala’s GHG emissions, so the country aims to  improve management of its forest resources (ALM 2009;  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2009;  Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales 2001).  The Maya Biosphere Reserve, which occupies roughly  60 percent of the Petén region in northern Guatemala  (Carr 2008), consists of three zones, which allow for  different levels of human activity to protect both the forest  and people’s livelihoods (Hughell and Butterfield 2008).  After extensive negotiations, the government granted communities rights to manage land in the reserve. The  primary product has been timber, though communities  have started harvesting nontimber resources and  exploring tourism. Communities have had to learn forest  management, sometimes struggling to do so, and the  distribution of benefits from community-based forestry  concessions has been somewhat controversial. Some  nonmembers claim that they have been partially excluded  from benefits, but current members counter that their  initial investments in managing their land justify their  benefits (Taylor 2010).  Even though community-based forestry has been  complicated by history, poverty, and competing interests,  it has contributed to conservation of Guatemala’s  forest resources and better livelihoods for the country’s  residents (Bray et al. 2008). The international community  helped Guatemala to set up the concessions for  community-based forestry and could continue to  help communities improve their forestry management  capabilities and diversify their economic activities.  BOX 22 | COMMUNITY FOREST  MANAGEMENT IN GUATEMALA’S  MAYA BIOSPHERE RESERVE  Australia’s indigenous peoples historically used small  fires to manage savanna land in the northern part of the  country. European settlers displaced the indigenous  peoples and discontinued their small burns. Over  time, this contributed to increasingly damaging and  uncontrollable wildfires, with as much as 69 percent of  large ranchlands burned in dry seasons. In 2010, an  indigenous corporation purchased land previously run  as a pastoral station, and reinstated the tradition of small  controlled burns. This change has limited wildfires to  less than 3 percent of the property. Along with providing  northern indigenous Australians a link to their cultural  heritage and historical homeland, this project qualified as  a national carbon-farming initiative. The sale of credits  from this initiative supports further management of the  property (Looker 2013).  BOX 23 | AUSTRALIA’S INDIGENOUS  PEOPLES MANAGE CONTROLLED BURNS  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up the five policy sectors described earlier, the recommendations  are grouped into four policy categories:  equitable low-carbon energy policy; equitably  shifting financial incentives; low-carbon transportation  planning; and equitable forestry policy. An  overarching category of recommendations focuses on  supporting vulnerability assessments across all mitigation  efforts. Several recommendations are crosscutting,  for instance, capacity building, and increases  in financial support are required in all cases.  Equitable Low-Carbon Energy Policy  The required energy transition will need to be  supported by a suite of specific policies, including  increasing electrification based on renewables, scaling  up renewables’ contribution to electricity grids,  and pursuing energy efficiency across all sectors.  ▪▪Bilateral and multilateral finance providers  should increase access to finance, credit or  other targeted approaches to encourage renewable  electrification and provide total energy  solutions to nontraditional banking populations  including women, the poor, and marginalized  communities. Such approaches could include  assistance to national lending agencies in the  form of building capacity for dealing with nontraditional  banking communities.  ▪▪There should be increased support from bilateral  and multilateral finance providers to scale up of  the use of renewables in countries with low access  to electricity and for strengthened efficiency  policies in countries with inefficient electricity  grids. These efforts should include support for  building the governance and policy enabling  environments required to regulate and maintain  renewable energy and efficiency programs.  ▪▪Bilateral and multilateral development agencies  and finance providers should provide guidance  and financial support to developing country governments  to enable equitable energy policies.  International organizations and finance providers  such as the Green Climate Fund, the World  Bank, and the UNFCCC should facilitate lesson  sharing among interested countries on feed-in  tariff design and implementation, reducing the  likelihood of unintended consequences for the  most vulnerable.  Equitably Shifting Financial Incentives  Shifting financial incentives to promote low-carbon  pathways is essential for reaching mitigation goals.  In addition, failing to shift incentives misses, or even  undermines, the opportunities at hand to enhance  the capabilities of people now and in the future. If  designed well, shifting incentive structures through  government policy could result in long-term benefits,  and provide revenues that can be used to meet the  needs of the most vulnerable and least well-off.  ▪▪Support should be provided by development  finance institutions so that all countries are able  to assess and publicly report their fossil-fuel  subsidies and set targets for phasing out fossil-fuel  subsidies. Phase-out should begin with reducing  or eliminating subsidies that benefit the  wealthiest individuals and communities and  with the aim of providing resources to build the  capabilities of the least well off, including their  health, education, and capacity to adapt to climate  impacts. A technical committee or subsidiary  body to the UNFCCC could work with the  IMF and others to develop guidance on how to  assess and quantify subsidies.  ▪▪Multilateral and bilateral funders should  provide the upfront finance needed to enable  equitable fossil-fuel subsidy reform and equitable  carbon-pricing policies. Such finance should  be especially targeted to reduce the immediate  impacts that confront poor populations.  ▪▪Funding and guidance should be provided for  the development of strategies to implement  fossil-fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing in  ways that support the capabilities of those who  are least well off. International statements of  support for carbon pricing, or efforts to promote  international carbon markets, should also  include commitments to equitable pricing.  ▪▪Equitable low-carbon plans should be mainstreamed  into economic growth strategies  developed by both national and international  institutions.   ▪▪Capacity building and funding should be  provided to support the domestic data  collection and analysis that are required to  assess the effects of fossil-fuel subsidy reform  and carbon pricing on low-income and vulnerable  populations.  Supporting Equitable Low-Carbon Transportation  Affordable, low-carbon transportation is a central  plank in shifting toward a low-carbon economy.  Low-carbon transportation presents a significant  mitigation potential and offers a range of benefits  for equity and capabilities if well designed. These  benefits include improvements in health and safety,  mobility, access to employment, and financial savings.  As highlighted in previous sections, infrastructure  supporting low-carbon transportation requires  significant upfront financial investment.  ▪▪Public international financial support for lowcarbon  infrastructure projects should be prioritized  for projects that can demonstrate that low  income, vulnerable or otherwise marginalized  communities will benefit and not be negatively  affected by the projects.  ▪▪National and subnational programmatic policies  to support affordable low-carbon transportation  should be scaled up, and programmatic  plans that include strategies to ensure that  co-benefits are made available to vulnerable or  low-income communities should be prioritized.  ▪▪Support should be provided for impact assessments  for low-carbon transportation to identify  potential employment, displacements, or other  impacts on low-income, vulnerable or informal  populations. Support should also be provided to  monitor unintended consequences as transport  or building policies are implemented and once  they are fully operationalized.  ▪▪Wherever possible an integrated planning approach  should be used to assess and implement  low-carbon transportation planning to ensure  policies reinforce each other and do not lead to increased  challenges for those who are least well off.  Equitable Climate and Forestry Policy  Equitable forestry policy is a crucial part of international  and national climate efforts. Discussions of  equity already have contributed to the development  of REDD and REDD+, and there are important  safeguards being developed to help ensure that  local communities benefit from climate policy and  carbon offset arrangements. The nexus between  community land rights and forest protection is  an important area in which international institutions  can help countries to undertake policies  that enhance both climate action and capabilities.  Support by international institutions and finance  for efforts to strengthen community forest rights  should be a fundamental element in policies and  programs to reduce emissions from deforestation  and forest degradation.  ▪▪Funders and other international institutions  should facilitate policies and programs to  strengthen communities’ rights involving use  of forest resources, management of forests, and  access to the forest, and should support due  process for decisions about forests.  ▪▪International institutions like the Global  Environment Facility (GEF), and others with  REDD+ experience, should help countries to set  up concessions for community-based forestry  in areas where communities commit to sustainably  manage timber and other forest products.  Vulnerability Assessments for  All Low-Carbon Projects  It is important to acknowledge that all low-carbon  policies could have differential impacts on capabilities.  In order to ensure that the capabilities of those  who are potentially most vulnerable— including  women, indigenous peoples, youth, or other marginalized  communities—are protected or improved,  all projects should be subject to evaluation at the  planning stage and monitoring during and after  implementation. In addition, active stakeholder  engagement and participation is an important  strategy for ensuring that policies have beneficial  impacts on vulnerable populations. Both of these  policymaking elements require institutional capacity  and resources.  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up ▪▪Capacity building and support should be provided  to ensure that “before and after” vulnerability  assessments and evaluations are carried  out, to identify impacts on the capabilities of all  affected groups.  ▪▪Support should be provided for participatory  planning and stakeholder engagement in the  development of mitigation policies across all  sectors. International organizations could also  engage in disseminating best practices for  policy design and public engagement.  To generate international  momentum and to  contribute to greater  wellbeing, especially  among those who are  most vulnerable or  least well off, climate  actions must also build  capabilities.    APPLYING THE  CAPABILITIES APPROACH  TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE,  ADAPTATION, AND LOSS  AND DAMAGE  Through examining case studies from 11 countries, this chapter  discusses the application of capabilities approach in understanding  the challenge in the design and implementation of national and local  adaptation policies and projects. This approach helps to understand  the different types and levels of vulnerability and the importance of  diverse and variable adaptation policies that can be designed through  the participatory planning process. The international community  can support these efforts through addressing the capacity needs  of the most vulnerable to engage in the policymaking process and  conducting research to inform long-term adaptation strategies.   As the impacts of climate change are increasingly  felt, prioritizing action on adaptation becomes  a pressing equity concern. If adequate action is  not taken, the people most vulnerable to climate  impacts and least able to adapt to them will face  loss of their livelihoods and reduced social and  economic opportunities.  At the same time, the fact that those hardest hit by  climate change are often the least responsible for  causing it raises significant equity issues. For some,  including many coastal communities and small  island developing states, the impacts may threaten  their very existence. Meanwhile, the current and  projected impacts have recently led to increasing  calls for comprehensive action to address issues of  loss and damage, those climate impacts to which  adaptation is difficult or impossible.  In international efforts to address adaptation and  resilience to climate change, much attention has  been appropriately placed on addressing the needs of  countries that are most vulnerable to climate change.  However, identifying and addressing the needs of  populations within countries, who are especially  vulnerable to climate impacts, is also an essential  task and is the focus of much of this chapter.  In this chapter, the report examines case studies,  drawn from 11 countries, both developing and  developed, highlighting the affect that vulnerability  can have on capabilities, and how well designed  policies targeting adaptation can build capabilities  and the resilience of countries.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up A Capabilities Approach to Adaptation  Requires Understanding, Participation,  and Innovation  Applying a capabilities lens to adaptation and resilience  (Box 24) serves as a reminder of the equity  dimensions present in adaptation. Different populations  are affected by climate change in varying  ways and to differing degrees, often due to disparities  in social and economic contexts and people’s  underlying capabilities. Moreover, climate policies  themselves may not be designed in ways that take  into account these diverse levels of capabilities.  Just as with low-carbon development, a capabilities  approach in the adaptation arena helps to identify  policies that will enhance equity and build capabilities,  as well as avoid unintended negative consequences,  particularly for the least well off.  In this chapter we apply the capabilities approach  as a lens to understand the challenges in the design  and implementation of adaptation policies and  projects. This lens:  ▪▪Highlights the importance of understanding  differing types and levels of vulnerability, and  incorporating that understanding into the design  of adaptation policies;  ▪▪Shows that adaptation policies must be highly  diverse and variable and based on inclusive  and participatory planning processes that meet  specific populations’ needs;  ▪▪Supports the ability of the most vulnerable and  least well off to pursue innovation in the design  and implementation of adaptation policies and  projects.  Each of these elements is examined using case  studies from developed and developing countries,  illustrating how an application of the capabilities  approach supports the achievement of equity.  This chapter also highlights the importance  of national adaptation planning that provides  for a focus on the most vulnerable populations  and ensures that capabilities are protected and  strengthened through robust participatory plans  based on inclusive participation.  The analysis in this chapter ultimately supports the  conclusion that, despite the highly context-specific  nature of adaptation, important lessons can be  drawn from diverse experiences that can inform  both national and international action and ultimately  build capabilities and achieve equity.  Adaptation is defined as an adjustment in natural or  human systems in response to actual or expected  climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or  exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC 2007). Adaptive  capacity has emerged as an important concept used to  refer to the ability that individuals or communities have  to adapt to the effects of climate change. Those with the  greatest capabilities are most likely to have a range of  resources and options available to take action, which can  contribute to their adaptive capacity (WRI et al. 2011) .  Vulnerability can be understood as a combination of  individual or community sensitivity to a climate or  nonclimate shock and their capacity to adapt to it. To  reduce vulnerability to climate change, we must focus  on building capabilities and adaptive capacity. Similarly,  the reduction of capabilities through climate impacts or  inequitable climate policies could increase vulnerability.  Resilience is the ability of a community to resist, absorb,  and recover from the effects of hazards in a timely and  efficient manner, preserving or restoring its essential  basic structures, functions, and identity (UNISDR 2009).  Stemming from analyses of ecosystems (Holling 1973)  and applied in disaster management (World Bank and  GFDRR 2013), resilience has been used to describe the  characteristics that enable communities to deal with large  shocks— both climate and nonclimate related—without  suffering significant losses or being fundamentally altered.  Loss and damage have usually been viewed as the entire  range of damage and permanent loss associated with  climate impacts that can no longer be avoided through  mitigation and for which adaptation is difficult or no  longer possible. Increasingly, the relationship between  mitigation, adaptation, and loss and damage is being seen  as more complex, highlighting the role that each plays in  influencing the other. The loss and damage attributable to  climate change is expected to increase over time due to  increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme weather  events, as well as impacts of slow-onset events.  BOX 24 | ADAPTATION, VULNERABILITY,  RESILIENCE, AND LOSS AND DAMAGE   Capabilities Reduce Vulnerability  Multiple and overlapping factors shape each person’s  capabilities and, as a result, influence their  vulnerability to climate impacts. Gender, economic  resources, physical ability, age, and ethnicity are just  some of the factors that combine to make it more  or less difficult for individual people to build their  capabilities. Some of these factors may be equally  experienced by all members in a specific community  or locality, but some of them will not. For instance,  gender norms about access to education or to financial  resources such as credit will shape the capabilities  of men and women differently.  Individuals or communities with a broader range of  capabilities may have reduced vulnerability because  they have access to more resources or abilities  to deal with potential climate impacts. Effective  adaptation policies must be sensitive to and address  these differences in vulnerability and capabilities,  including by avoiding approaches that exacerbate  existing vulnerabilities. Policies and projects  that are designed to respond to the differentiated  nature of capabilities and vulnerabilities, and that  also deliberately aim to build capabilities, can be  highly effective in building adaptive capacity and  enhancing equity for those who are most vulnerable.  Adaptation processes in line with development  strategies that reduce vulnerabilities and increase  people’s adaptive capacity in a broad sense would  bring immediate benefits as well as strengthen  people’s ability to deal with future threats (Burton  et al. 2002; Huq et al. 2003; Adger et al. 2007).  Responses to climate impacts in coastal Bangladesh  demonstrate the ways in which physical climate  impacts can intersect with different levels of capabilities,  and without well-designed policy interventions,  exacerbate existing inequalities (Box 25).  The importance of considering differing types and  levels of vulnerability is especially stark in efforts  to build resilience in the agriculture sector, particularly  in poorer rural communities. Agriculture  is central to many people’s livelihoods, particularly  in developing countries, where it constitutes  approximately 29 percent of GDP and employs 65  percent of the population (Campbell et al. 2011).  A combination of factors, including sea level rise and  the consequent salt-water intrusion, combined with an  absence of any effective government water management  programs and an attractive market for shrimp, prompted  an increase in shrimp farming and other types of  aquaculture by larger landowners, replacing the rice and  vegetable farms along the coast.  This shift—a form of adaptation that maintained or  enhanced their capabilities—was facilitated by large  landowners’ greater adaptive capacity, in this case  access to land and finance. However, this option was not  available to poorer households, and their capabilities  have been diminished as salinization increased and  land became unsuitable for farming or other uses.  Poorer villagers also face decreasing access to natural  resources that, in the past, provided the rural population  with materials for fuel, fodder, building, and food. Unlike  wealthier community members, they may not have  other means—such as access to finance—to get these  necessities (Pouliotte, Smit, and Westerhoff 2009).  BOX 25 | SHRIMP FARMING IN  SOUTHEAST BANGLADESH  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up The connection between nutrition and livelihoods  is particularly close for the rural poor, many of  whom depend on subsistence agriculture (Campbell  et al. 2011). As a source of food and livelihood,  agriculture supports many other capabilities, such  as access to education and shelter. However, there  are substantial variations in the vulnerability and  capabilities of communities facing potential climate  impacts to agriculture. For instance, as shown in  the case of Uganda (Box 26), disparities in access  to credit and education shape the options farmers  have when addressing climate risks.  Identifying the most vulnerable populations or  communities, particularly by looking at the intersection  of physical climate impacts and social vulnerability,  is among the most important challenges  in developing adaptation policies and climate  risk management systems. Studies identifying  climate hazards and social vulnerability are typically  conducted separately, but these approaches  can be integrated. For example, a study of coastal  areas in the United States (Box 27) examined both  the potential impact of natural hazards and the  populations most likely to be negatively affected  because of their social and economic characteristics  (Oxfam 2009). Understanding vulnerability has  significant potential for improving planning and   decision-making, particularly in order to design policies  that actively build the capabilities of vulnerable  Most Ugandans have only short-term adaptation  strategies that will be ineffective at dealing with longterm  changes to the climate (Caffrey et al. 2013; Berman,  Quinn, and Paavola 2014; Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza  2011). To survive shocks, households employ the  following strategies: drawing down savings, borrowing  money, reducing consumption (sometimes withdrawing  children from education), selling assets (such as  livestock), increasing labor (sometimes with children),  and migrating (Berman, Quinn, and Paavola 2014; Hisali,  Birungi, and Buyinza 2011).  Most of these strategies have the disadvantage that  they offer only short-term relief. Moreover, relatively  disadvantaged households in Uganda can find it difficult,  or even impossible, to use them. Education, wealth, age,  gender, access to markets, access to credit, and land  tenure all affect households’ access to certain adaptation  strategies. For example, households with higher  education levels are better able to diversify their income  sources. Access to credit allows households to avoid  drawing down savings (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza  2011; Caffrey et al. 2013; Berman, Quinn, and Paavola  2014). Because of prevailing gender roles, women have  relatively fewer employment opportunities, less time  to seek employment, and might have fewer employable  skills (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza 2011).  Uganda can improve its resilience to climate change by  increasing farmers’ access to credit, increasing labor  productivity in agriculture (through investment in research  and agricultural extension), improving access to markets,  developing new crop varieties, increasing farmer groups’  capacity to work with each other and national initiatives,  and investing in other sectors such as public health and  education (Hisali, Birungi, and Buyinza 2011; Caffrey et  al. 2013; Berman, Quinn, and Paavola 2014).  BOX 26 | ADAPTATION CHALLENGES FOR  FARMERS IN UGANDA  The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) was developed  by the University of South Carolina and applied with  Oxfam America to climate-change-related hazards. The  SoVI statistically examines the underlying social and  demographic characteristics of various populations and  how they intersect with climate-change-related hazards.  The study used a series of maps that overlay climate-change-  related hazards with social vulnerability. The maps  identified hotspots in the southeastern United States at  significant risk in the face of four climate-change-related  hazards: drought, flooding, hurricane force winds, and sea  level rise.  To determine social vulnerability, the SoVI uses variables to define the multiple dimensions of social  vulnerability; eight components account for most of the  variation in social vulnerability in the study: wealth, age,  race, gender, ethnicity, rural farm populations, special  needs populations, and employment status. Roughly percent of all U.S. counties that experience persistent  poverty (defined as a county in which at least 20 percent  of the population experiences poverty for three decades or  more) lie within this region (Oxfam 2009).  From these data, it was possible to determine not only  where social vulnerability is concentrated in the region but  also which areas are most vulnerable to which climate-change-  related hazards.  BOX 27 | SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX  IN THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES   communities. It provides a critical first step toward  developing informed hazard-reduction strategies  and improving resilience of the most vulnerable.  Recognition of the differences in vulnerabilities and  capabilities in the face of climate shocks, such as  extreme weather events, can be incorporated into  adaptation planning. A key example emerges from  Bangladesh’s continued efforts to build greater  resilience in the face of tropical storms, cyclones, and  flooding (Box 28). A key part of this effort has been  the development of comprehensive disaster management  programs that have incorporated recognition of  the differentiation of populations in storm-sensitive  areas. For instance, such efforts have included  recognition of gender differentiation in terms of  vulnerability to nonclimate risks, such as gendered  harassment or social norms that prohibit girls from  learning to swim, and the intersection of these with  extreme weather events (WRI et al. 2011).  Adaptation Projects Need Participatory Design  Designing effective and long-term adaptation  responses requires understanding the pathways  that people are currently pursuing toward greater  well-being, and ensuring that interventions are  aligned and ultimately support these goals. A  capabilities approach enables policymakers to do  this, as well as to identify the specific opportunities  and barriers that make their ability to achieve wellbeing  more or less successful. From this perspective,  a capabilities approach draws attention to local  contexts, suggesting that each adaptation project or  need must be designed with inclusive participation  by those affected by climate impacts, particularly  the most vulnerable.  This is illustrated by two cases in Vietnam, both  involving adaptive attempts to protect coastlines  through mangrove restoration (Box 29). Unanticipated  side effects were experienced in the northern  project, because of a failure to incorporate the  priorities of the communities they intended to  protect (Bruun and Casse 2013). By contrast, in  the southern project, the recognition of inclusive  processes to design and implement mangrove restoration  ultimately resulted in the achievement of not  only increased adaptive capacity but also long-term  social and economic opportunities for all members  of the community.  The population of Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to  natural disasters, especially those occurring near coasts,  because two thirds of the population live at or below an  elevation of five meters (Bangladesh 2009). Given the  country’s vulnerability, the Government of Bangladesh  has developed a Comprehensive Disaster Management  Programme (CDMP) and a National Plan for Disaster  to respond to disasters and protect the most vulnerable  members of its society.  Women are exposed to additional risks that are not  experienced by men, before, during and after natural  disasters. Women, for example, are discouraged from  learning to swim. They are less likely to have access to the  knowledge networks available to men about impending  floods or storm surges (Reid 2014). They face sexual  abuse in shelters that are set up after natural disasters.  If disasters damage sanitation and drinking water  infrastructure, women face harassment and attacks when  they seek privacy to relieve themselves and when they  travel great distances for safe drinking water (Department  of Women’s Affairs 2012). Girls are also less likely than  boys to pursue primary education after disasters (UNISDR  2011; Department of Women’s Affairs 2012).  Recognizing this level of vulnerability, Bangladesh  addresses some of these issues in its disaster planning.  In the first phase of the CDMP (2004–09), Bangladesh  created the Disaster Management Information Centre;  mapped hazards, risks, and vulnerabilities; and trained  public officials (WRI et al. 2011). In the second phase  (2010–14), Bangladesh identified linkages among  stakeholders, levels of government, approaches to  disaster-risk reduction, and approaches to climate-change  adaptation. One of these linkages was the Department  of Women’s Affairs in the Ministry of Women and  Children, which was involved in developing nationwide  Disaster Risk Reduction strategies and, with support  from the CDMP, is working to find culturally appropriate  solutions. National disaster planners are incorporating  gender concerns into overall planning, and the Ministry  of Women and Children is mainstreaming these strategies  into its regular projects through a number of initiatives  that range from the high level (creating networks with  disaster risk experts) to the practical (teaching staff and  partners how to swim).  BOX 28 | BANGLADESH’S  COMPREHENSIVE DISASTER  MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In both cases, the national government, local governments,  and international NGOs implemented  the restoration projects (WRI et al. 2011; Osbeck  et al. 2010). While healthy mangroves can be a  solution to both climate- and nonclimate-related  problems, they take time to grow, and cannot be  used immediately for aquaculture or seafood collection  until the forests are somewhat mature (Osbeck  et al. 2010). The involved parties needed to remain  engaged over a long time before the majority of the  benefits of the projects were realized.  Both the Vietnam cases highlight the importance of  building adaptation planning around local contexts  and inclusive participation. In the Vietnamese cases  the ability to engage and benefit all community members—  including the poorest—was crucial to success.  By not fully understanding the local reality that poorer  families had to have access to marine resources in  mangroves, the northern adaptation scheme actually  resulted in a loss of capabilities for some.  Slow-onset impacts of climate change, like sea  level rise, threaten to break down individual and  community capabilities over time. Attempts to  address slow-onset events must not ignore the  more immediate needs of communities, lest the  intended beneficiaries lose capabilities through  adaptation interventions. Such losses are important  to acknowledge on their own, but also can fuel local  opposition to adaptation attempts.  Vietnam has an extensive coastline,  more than 3,000 kilometers long,  with two important river deltas that  contain most of the country’s arable  land (Bruun and Casse 2013). The  country is therefore very susceptible  to sea level rise, storm surges, and  saltwater intrusion. One way Vietnam  is protecting its coastline and crops is  through mangrove forest restoration.  Mangrove forests buffer coastlines and  coastal communities against severe  weather and storm surges (IFRC 2014);  they also sequester carbon and provide  a rich habitat for biodiversity. War and  economic development projects (for  example, for aquaculture) have led to  the loss of 80 percent of the country’s  original mangrove forests since the  1950s (Tai et al. 2009).  Different policy approaches to  mangrove restoration were taken in  different parts of the country. In the  north, mangrove-planting projects  were given protected status, which  prevented local communities from  using those portions of coastline  for shrimp harvesting and other  seafood collection. Local communities  were hired to plant and protect the  mangroves but, once funding ended,  the local people stopped protecting the  mangroves, in part because they were  opposed to the monoculture approach  of the restoration (WRI et al. 2011;  Osbeck et al. 2010).  In the south, however, efforts were  made to incorporate the poverty  alleviation concerns of local  communities alongside coastline  protection. This inclusive approach  was especially successful in places  where mangrove restoration was  coupled with social services and  infrastructure projects, and where the  legal classification of the forests did not  prohibit local communities from using  the areas sustainably (WRI et al. 2011;  Osbeck et al. 2010). At least 8,960  hectares have been replanted since  1994 (IFRC 2014, 4), and sea dikes and  private property have been significantly  better protected following mangrove  restoration (IFRC 2014, 5–6).  In the northern projects, the relatively  wealthy benefited most from the  mangrove restoration because the  projects increased their political and  managerial power. The poorest people  were most dependent on the mangroves,  but lost access to the rich marine life  attracted to the mangrove forests, which  represented an important supplement to  their diets (Hue 2005). As a result they  actually lost capabilities through the  attempted adaptation project.  Both approaches, in the north and the  south, also had very different effects  on the livelihoods of men and women.  Shrimp farmers are more likely to  be men, so protecting the mangrove  forests from commercial farming  reduced men’s ability to practice  aquaculture for commercial gain.  Women, conversely, are more likely  to collect seafood such as clams and  oysters that thrive in mangrove forests  to provide for their families or to sell.  In protected mangroves, they were  not always permitted to collect those  species, so an important source of  calories or household income was no  longer available (Osbeck et al. 2010).  These patterns serve as an illustration  of the importance of taking differential  vulnerabilities and capabilities in  specific locations into account when  designing adaption policies.  BOX 29 | VIETNAM’S MANGROVE RESTORATION   Adaptation efforts that focus on the provision of  knowledge and capacity building to the communities  themselves are likely to be more successful in  building resilience across both social and economic  contexts. An example of this is an online planning  tool developed in Australia to assist coastal communities  determine their climate change vulnerability  and put in place long-term, locally appropriate  plans for the future (Box 30). Local communities  with increased capacity are empowered to make  informed decisions about how to adapt to locally  specific climate change threats.  Applying the capabilities approach to climate  change strongly emphasizes the need to ensure that  vulnerable populations are included in research on  climate impacts and adaptation responses. Men  and women play different roles in society and can  bring different sets of resources, capacities, and  knowledge, as well as different needs and requirements,  to initiatives for climate change adaptation.  Furthermore, there is increasing recognition of  the value of indigenous knowledge in improving  observations of climate change and its impacts,  and for the assessment of impacts, vulnerability,  and adaptation, particularly in vulnerability assessments  (UNFCCC 2013a).  The Arctic Council’s Arctic Climate Impact Assessment  (ACIA 2005) is an example of a successful  approach to combining indigenous traditional knowledge  with western science that resulted in the incorporation  of a broad set of observations from indigenous  peoples with a regional assessment of the impacts of  climate change in the Arctic. Indigenous traditional  knowledge was incorporated into all aspects of the  assessment and highlighted in the resulting report.  Such extensive collaboration led to a more robust  knowledge base on the impacts of climate change on  the Arctic (UNFCCC 2013a). Indigenous and scientific  knowledge strengthened each other; for example,  indigenous knowledge was able to help explain how  caribou migrations may be triggered by seasonal cues,  such as day length, air temperature, or ice thickness,  strengthening the assessments of biologists (Thorpe  et al. 2001; as quoted in ACIA 2005). In cases where  indigenous and scientific observations conflicted, new  research opportunities were identified for assessing  environmental change, deepening insights into  the nature and impacts of environmental change  (UNFCCC 2013a).  In Uganda, a project was proposed under the  country’s national adaptation program of action to  include indigenous knowledge in development of  the program (Box 31).  Although coastal communities in Australia were aware  of the changing climate and the likely local impacts of  sea level rise and increased extreme weather events,  there was a limited awareness of how they would affect  the local commercial and recreational fishing, marine  tourism, and aquaculture.  In response, an online planning tool was developed by  Murdoch University, the University of Tasmania, and  the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research  Organisation (CSIRO).  The tool was based on three case studies that included  different geographical features and populations to draw  out key lessons on how each coastal town dealt with  the effects of climate change in the marine environment  (Coastal Climate Blueprint 2014).  Based on the information gathered from these case  studies and the framework for vulnerability established  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  coastal communities across Australia are now able to  determine their community’s vulnerability to the effects  of climate change in the marine environment. Based on  a questionnaire identifying exposure to climate change  risks and the community’s natural, human, social,  financial, and physical capital that may be useful in  avoiding or mitigating those risks, an overall score is  provided representing the vulnerability of a particular  community (Coastal Climate Blueprint 2014) .  This relatively simple tool enables communities that  may have little to no expertise in climate science and  vulnerability risk assessments, to understand their strengths  and weaknesses in the face of marine climate change and  prepare for future changes in climate and sea life.  BOX 30 | INCREASING AWARENESS  OF COASTAL IMPACTS IN AUSTRALIAN  COASTAL COMMUNITIES  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Capabilities Foster Innovation Needed to Adapt  A capabilities approach emphasizes that people  can, and do, make decisions and seek strategies  that improve their overall well-being. Applying this  principle to the concept of adaptation and resilience  requires policies and projects to support innovation.  Through innovation, people are more likely to  find solutions that are both efficient and effective  and locally relevant. Such bottom-up approaches  will provide more lasting adaptive responses than  will comparable top-down approaches.  This concept is rooted in a broader theme seen  throughout this report—that the ability of the  individual to innovate is underpinned by larger  systems. Access to new ideas and new technologies  and financial resources varies widely but is essential  for innovation (Rogers 2003). From an equity  perspective, it is critical to ensure that particularly  vulnerable people have the resources they need  to innovate, and sufficient basic social safety to  allow them to attempt something new. This often  requires improved access to finance for traditionally  nonbanking populations, and specialized capacity  building and support for women and youth.  Innovation in agriculture  Innovation is particularly important in agriculture.  Adequate food is a basic human need; in the coming  decades, agricultural production will have to rise to  meet the demand of increasing populations, compounded  by the growing popularity of meat-intensive  diets (Campbell et al. 2011; Godfray et al. 2010;  Anwar et al. 2013). Adaptation policies must promote  innovation by farmers in new techniques, planting  times, and seed varieties. Of critical importance is that  all farmers and landholders have the opportunity to  innovate and do not face financial barriers. Unless  climate adaptation policies specifically aim to be  inclusive, well-off farmers are more likely to benefit,  while others remain vulnerable. Farmers’ wealth and  farm size affect their ability to experiment with new  practices because wealthier farmers can more easily  set aside a portion of their plots to try out new  methods (Tambo and Abdoulaye 2012).  For example, in Tanzania, smallholders with capital,  including assets such as livestock, and direct access  to extension service information, were more likely to  experiment with drought-resistant maize varieties  than were farmers without these resources (Westengen  and Brysting 2014). Government intervention  can assist in the process, providing seed finance  to entrepreneurs and therefore encouraging other  institutions to follow. In Zimbabwe, the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) helped  kick start seed multiplication businesses promoting  climate-change-resilient seeds (UNDP 2014d).  According to a report by International Development  Research Centre, “seed funding might lead to debt  finance, including from local commercial banks”  (Tippmann et al. 2013). Supporting innovation  in this way ensures that sources of livelihoods are  climate-change resilient from the start, more efficiently  combining climate and development objectives.  These examples illustrate the role of locally  driven innovation and the importance of directing  global innovation toward the need of vulnerable  populations. Although it was farmers themselves  who experimented and developed new agricultural  systems, the drought-resistant seeds and additional  extension service information stems from broader  social investments in research and development.  Innovation is essential, but access to the tools of innovation  may be linked to the same factors that drive  differentiated vulnerability and capabilities broadly.  One of the projects proposed by Uganda in its national  adaptation program of action (NAPA) was the indigenous  knowledge and natural resources management project.  The project was designed to deepen the understanding  of indigenous knowledge and its potential use for  strengthening adaptation. In particular, the NAPA  highlighted that a “lack of frameworks…coupled with total  disregard of indigenous knowledge due to misconception  and disrespect of cultural values” had resulted in a lack  of research in the area (Uganda 2007). During the NAPA  consultation process, indigenous practices were discussed,  including the use of water harvesting and seeds to purify  water in times of water scarcity and the need to understand  traditional food preservation techniques to increase food  security (UNFCCC 2013a).  BOX 31 | UGANDA’S USE OF INDIGENOUS  TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN ITS  NATIONAL ADAPTATION PROGRAMME  OF ACTION   For instance, access to key resources for agricultural  innovation, such as land and credit, are highly  gender-related in many countries (Demetriades and  Esplen 2009; Ashby et al. 2012). Access to information  can also be unequal. Gender-bias in government  institutions may restrict women’s access to agricultural  extension services, which improve agricultural  productivity in general, as well as in the face of climate  change in particular (Swarup et al. 2011). Women  are also likely to be engaged in many other activities,  including child and elder care responsibilities, and  thus may have fewer chances to build savings to withstand  climate-change-related financial shocks (Demetriades  and Esplen 2009). Climate change adaptation  and mitigation interventions that are sensitive to  gender tend to perform better (Ashby et al. 2012), as  the case study of China demonstrates (Box 32).  A capabilities approach to examining innovation in  the adaptation context highlights the importance  of broader systems in supporting those capabilities  that enable individuals to innovate and adapt.  Strategies to support adaptation and resilience  must therefore prioritize funding pilot studies and  providing access to credit for early adopters.  Similarly, some innovations extend beyond the  scale of the individual and stem from the cooperation  of larger entities such as NGOs, governments,  or the private sector. The development of a “system  of rice intensification” is an example of an  attempt to harness the innovation of these players  and direct it toward efforts to build capabilities of  communities by improving labor efficiency, adding  to soil health, and increasing yields (Box 33).  Importantly, this process recognizes that providing  technological improvements alone is not enough:  capacity building and appropriate local engagement  is essential. Adaptation must be designed to  respond to the diversity of actual needs, desires,  and ongoing efforts of communities trying to protect  and improve their well-being.  China has pursued government-led  projects to improve farmers’ climate  resilience. Roughly one third of China’s  agricultural land is in the Huanghe,  Huaihe, and Haihe River Plain (3H  Plain), which produces half of China’s  grain (Dan et al. 2012; Wang and Li  2010). However, the 3H Plain lacks  water resources (Dan et al. 2012).  In 2004, China initiated a regional  project with the objective of improving  agricultural production by addressing  water scarcity in the 3H Plain. The  project had a budget of US$463  million, financed by the World Bank,  and the organizing agency was the  Ministry of Finance’s State Office  of Comprehensive Agricultural  Development (CAD). In 2006, the  program introduced measures  specifically aimed at adapting  to climate change (for example,  introducing drought- and pest-resistant  crop varieties) using a US$5  million investment from the Global  Environment Facility (WRI et al. 2011).  Farmers were initially reluctant to  adopt new crop varieties, but they were  persuaded after they experienced higher  yields. Project organizers helped create  water-user groups, which enabled  them to disseminate information about  water-efficient practices. Irrigation  infrastructure was improved, which  made more water available for crop  production. Water-user groups took  over the operation and maintenance  of facilities constructed during the  project. The project benefits could  then be sustained after the project  formally ended because affected  citizens were engaged in its success.  Women received particular attention.  For example, a gender trust fund was  created to finance training programs  specifically for women (WRI et al. 2011;  Wang and Li 2010).  China’s program improved agricultural  production in the 3H Plain and  simultaneously made agricultural  production more resilient to climate  change (Wang and Li 2010). An extreme  drought struck part of the 3H Plain in  early 2009, but farmers weathered it well  because of the improved irrigation, better  water management practices, and drought-resistant  crop varieties (WRI et al. 2011).  The project’s success was, at least  in part, the result of the integrated  approach adopted by CAD, its  collaboration with scientists, and  incorporation of farmers’ views. CAD  coordinated activities among Chinese  government agencies in different  sectors and at different levels of  government. This integrated approach  helped bring people with relevant  expertise and authority into the project  to achieve its goals. The organizers also  worked with scientists to evaluate initial  efforts and demonstration projects and  then incorporate results from those  evaluations into future project work.  Finally, famers’ views were elicited  through a survey to shape project  activities in accordance with their needs  and attitudes (Wang and Li 2010).  BOX 32 | CHINA’S APPROACH TO FARMING IN A DRY REGION  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Innovations in health care  The impacts of climate change on health will  depend on many factors, many of which are directly  related to capabilities, such as the effectiveness of  a community’s public health and safety systems to  address or prepare for the risk and the behavior,  age, gender, and economic status of individuals  affected. Current estimates indicate that the  impacts could extend to approximately 250,000  additional deaths per year between 2030 and  2050 as a result of heat exposure in elderly people  (38,000), diarrhea (48,000), malaria (60,000), and  childhood undernutrition (95,000) (WHO 2014).  Applying a capabilities approach highlights the role  that innovation could play in both the prevention  of these impacts and continued efforts to develop  better strategies for dealing with neglected tropical  diseases as well as the development of broad social  systems such as early warning systems for events  such as heat waves or malarial outbreaks. This has  been seen in Botswana, through the creation of  effective early warning systems, developed from  methods historically used in agriculture, that have  led to decreased vulnerability and improved human  well-being (Box 34).  A System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is an  agroecological approach that focuses on better  husbandry of rice crops. The concept is that changes  in how rice is planted by hand will result in higher  yields, require fewer inputs such as seeds, and lower  methane gas emissions from paddies. Such an approach  addresses food shortage issues, increases opportunities  for small-scale farmers to become involved, increases  profitability, and reduces emissions (Oxfam 2014; Global  Commission on the Economy and Climate 2014).  Oxfam started working on SRI in 2000 and has since  expanded its programs to 12 countries in Asia, West  Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean (Oxfam  2014). As of 2013, over 1.5 million smallholder farmers  in groups supported by Oxfam’s partners in Cambodia,  Sri Lanka, and Vietnam had benefited from SRI, using  both local and improved varieties of rice (Oxfam 2014).  Widespread adoption of SRI has led to increases in  yields in addition to improved soil ecosystems after  each season of SRI practice, ultimately improving the  capability of farmers to achieve social and economic  well-being (Global Commission on the Economy and  Climate 2014).  The same husbandry principles are applied to new crop  rotations, such as potatoes in Vietnam. Rice straw and  stubble are used as a mulch bed, which, as it gradually  decomposes, improves the soil structure for the next rice  crop. Farmers have saved between 28 and 47 percent in  terms of labor, while gaining improvements of between 8  and 25 percent in yields and earning additional income  of $480–950 per hectare (Oxfam 2014). They are also  increasingly adopting complementary technologies such  as handheld rotary weeders, which not only improve  efficiency but also address concerns over women’s labor.  Successful scaling up of these innovations requires an  enabling policy environment, particularly in terms of  building human capital and empowering communities.  SRI is currently being practiced in over 50 countries and  is promoted by organizations such as the International  Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Deutsche  Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the  Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World  Bank (Oxfam 2014).  BOX 33 | SYSTEM OF RICE  INTENSIFICATION   Using Capabilities to Strengthen  National Adaptation Planning  Adaptation planning is an issue of extreme importance  to those who are least well off or most vulnerable  to climate change. The capabilities of future  generations in vulnerable areas are likely to depend  on robust and forward-looking adaptation planning.  To ensure integration across portfolios and  alignment with funding mechanisms and regulatory  regimes—such planning should be focused at  the national level. However, many vulnerable and  marginalized communities—which include future  generations—have limited or no capacity to engage  in policymaking, particularly at the national and  regional levels, thus they may be overlooked if their  needs are not explicitly included in planning.  The design of national planning processes for climate  change adaptation must include strong mechanisms  for public engagement to protect the most vulnerable  segments of societies and help build their capabilities.  Marginalized groups and the least well off must  be represented in policymaking (Foti and de Silva  Botswana reduced its number of malaria cases by percent between 2008 and 2012, from 17,886 cases in  2008 to 311 cases in 2012, and reduced the deaths from  malaria from 12 in 2008 to just three in 2012 through an  innovative program that adapted a weather early warning  system (Simon et al. 2013).  Malaria is caused by parasites that are transmitted to  people through the bites of infected mosquitos. The disease  is preventable and curable, but still kills approximately  627,000 people every year, the majority being children  under five in Africa (WHO 2013). The distribution of malaria  is strongly affected by climate and its transmission tends to  occur in warm, humid areas where water can collect (WHO  2009). Advances in prevention and control measures have  significantly reduced the malaria burden in many places,  but some experts fear that climate change might impede  that progress as changing temperatures and rainfall patterns  expand the ranges of infected mosquitos, spreading the  disease to additional parts of the world ( Smith et al. 2014).  In Botswana, the outbreak of malaria is seasonal and  tends to follow rainy periods. Using climate-forecasting  data, previously used only in the agricultural sector,  Botswana’s National Malaria Control Programme can  now map probability distributions of the risk of malaria.  Predictions of malaria incidence can be made up to four  months in advance (Thomson et al. 2006). This advance  warning can give governments and healthcare institutions  increased time to prepare and take preventative measures  such as spraying insecticides, distributing bed nets, and  distributing antimalarial drugs.  Understanding one of the risks most pertinent for  well-being in the face of climate change impacts, and  identifying the opportunity to innovate with existing data  and methodologies, enabled Botswana to develop an  early warning system which is more efficient, effective,  and locally applicable. It has allowed for more targeted  interventions and, in conjunction with improved  prevention measures, helped the country significantly  reduce its malaria burden.  BOX 34 | ADVANCE WARNING SYSTEMS  FOR MALARIA IN BOTSWANA  A national adaptation plan (NAP) is a process by which  a country can develop and implement a long-term plan  for national adaptation in a way that is fully integrated  with broader development plans and sectoral strategies  and institutions. The UNFCCC has produced technical  guidelines to help countries develop their plans, but the  process for developing NAPs is highly flexible and can  be designed for specific country contexts.  By contrast, a national adaptation program of  action (NAPA) is a process for least developed  countries to identify priority activities that respond to  their urgent and immediate needs to adapt to climate  change—those for which further delay would increase  vulnerability and/or costs at a later stage.  Together, both processes enable Parties to the Convention  to plan for both short- and long-term effects of climate  change in a way that is both action-oriented and country-driven.  Both NAPs and NAPAs are determined according  to national circumstances.  BOX 35 | WHAT ARE NAPS AND NAPAS?  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up 2010). To participate in environmental decisions,  poor and marginalized people need access to information  and  decision-making. Barriers to their access  to policymaking and appropriate ways to insure their  inclusion are presented in Table 5.  The UNFCCC has developed two mechanisms to  help Parties to the Convention plan for both short- and  long-term effects of climate change: national  adaptation plans (NAPs) and national adaptation  programs of action (NAPAs) (Box 35). To ensure  that adaptation planning processes, including the  development of NAPs and NAPAs, protect vulnerable  segments of the population, governments  should first identify the groups who are likely to be  impacted by a given problem or policy and ensure  that their perspectives and input are included in the  planning process (Box 36). Applying a capabilities  approach emphasizes the importance of allowing  individuals to determine which capabilities are  essential to their well-being and taking a proactive  role in the planning process. Robust arguments can  be made for the effectiveness of such an approach,  Table 5 | Barriers to Access to Policymaking for the Poor and Policy Responses  BARRIER POLICY RESPONSE  Lack of legal criteria for enhanced engagement Identify the poor and establish criteria to ensure enhanced access  Literacy: Basic reading skills; ability to understand technical  content; language  Use the appropriate form: ensure that information around decisions and  opportunities to influence decisions for the environment matches the  technical understanding, literacy levels, and native languages of the poor  Access to communication channels: Poor physical access to  information technology such as internet, papers, television,  radio, texting  Use the appropriate channels: ensure that information relevant to decisions  and opportunities to influence decisions about the environment are  communicated through channels used by the poor  Cost: Official fees; travel; foregone work; time constraints;  cost of childcare; corruption  Reduce costs: remove barriers, reduce official fees, and provide subsidies  for participation  Exposure to risk from participating: Personal risk (physical  or psychological intimidation); property risk (threat of  expropriation, burglary, etc.)  Defend the individuals and organizations that promote access  Official documentation: Lack of legal identity; burden of proof Remove legal barriers of standing and evidence  Cultural context: Expectations about who has a “voice”;  meaningfulness of participation  Build capacity and raise awareness, make the voice of the poor influential  Source: Foti and de Silva (2010, 16).   based on the principle that people are more likely  to participate if they believe that their input will  be influential (Foti and de Silva 2010). The earlier  public engagement starts, the more likely it is to  influence the outcome of a given policy planning  process (WRI et al. 2011).  A central tenet of the capabilities approach is the recognition  that every human being is best able to decide  for him or herself what it means to have achieved a  state of well-being. Applying this philosophy to planning  strongly supports public participation, bottomup  governance and a broad institutional/programmatic  approach, as opposed to narrowly targeted,  top-down adaptation mechanisms.  Locally designed and compiled adaptation plans,  such as those in Nepal and Pakistan, provide  excellent examples of planning processes aimed  at ensuring a decentralized and bottom-up planning  process. They are focused on local adaptation  needs and concepts of well-being, but they  are also designed to feed into top-down national  planning processes. Local adaptation plans of  action (LAPAs) take a “vulnerability first” approach  to climate change adaptation, and can be contrasted  with national adaptation programs of  action (NAPAs) in their bottom-up, local approach,  despite being often funded through similar institutions  and mechanisms.  Climate change poses a significant  threat to livelihoods in Nepal.  Temperatures have been rising since  the 1960s with an average increase  of 0.004–0.006oC every year. Rainfall  is becoming increasingly erratic, with  longer dry periods and wetter, more  intense monsoons (Selvaraju 2014).  Reduced rainfall and glacial melt are  contributing to lower water tables,  reduced river flows, landslides, and  flooding. More than two-thirds of  agricultural land in Nepal is rainfed,  thus more erratic rainfall will have  negative impacts on crop yields (World  Bank 2014a).  In September 2010, the Nepalese  government submitted a national  adaptation program of action (NAPA)  to the UNFCCC that identified several  climate resilience projects. To develop  its NAPA, Nepal identified current and  future threats from climate change.  The plan proposed how to combat  them through six sectoral themes  (water and energy, agriculture, forests  and biodiversity, public health, urban  settlements, and disaster risk reduction),  and three crosscutting themes  (livelihoods and governance, gender,  and social inclusion) (Dixit 2012).  The government commissioned a  vulnerability index to quantify the  climate vulnerability of Nepal’s districts and to prioritize the country’s  most vulnerable communities.  Environmental stressors caused in  part by climate change (for example,  forest fires, landslides, floods, and  biodiversity loss) were compared  with adaptive capacity indicators (for  example, poverty levels, literacy levels,  access to irrigation technologies, and  access to drinking water) to determine  overall vulnerability (Ministry of  Environment 2010). The vulnerability  index guided the identification and  prioritization of adaptation needs in  Nepal’s NAPA.  Nepal’s NAPA process focused on  gathering information on climate,  community characteristics, and  vulnerability at the local level  (Dixit 2012). Nepal sent more  than 60 government officials from  different ministries to participate in  consultations with villagers, village  development committee officials,  government agencies, and civil society  representatives. These officials were  tasked with collecting information on  both climate impacts for each sectoral  theme in ecological regions, and on  existing coping strategies used in each  transect region (Dixit 2012).  To inform the public, Nepal’s  government created a website with  information on climate change and  ongoing adaptation activities. The  government also staged events in  rural areas to encourage climate  change awareness (NCCKMC 2014).  Adaptation projects will address the  need for climate resilient modifications  for roads and bridges, water supply  and sanitation, irrigation, urban  development, flood protection, glacier  lake outburst floods, sand mining, and  education (Nepal 2014).  Financing for the development of Nepal’s  NAPA, and for the projects the country  hopes to initiate, was provided by a  number of multilateral donors, including  the Least Developed Country Fund  (LDCF), the United Nations Development  Programme, and the British and Danish  governments (Dixit 2012).  BOX 36 | NEPAL’S NAPA AND CLIMATE VULNERABILITY INDEX  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Nepal developed local adaptation plans  of action (LAPAs), compiled at the  local level by multistakeholder teams,  including vulnerable communities. The  development of LAPAs was in response  to perceived shortcomings of the  UNFCCC’s national adaptation program  of action (NAPA) process undertaken  by Nepal in 2010. Despite successfully  integrating vulnerability assessments  and prioritizing adaptation projects  accordingly, the national plan was still  seen, as being an overly broad, topdown  estimation that did not adequately  capture local needs. Since the impacts  of climate change dramatically changed  from one village to the other, a top-down  process such as a NAPA was considered  ill-equipped to cater for meeting local  needs (Chaudhury et al. 2014).  During the Nepal NAPA consultation  process, suggestions were made  by participants to localize a NAPA,  generating the idea of a concurrent  planning process or LAPA. In 2011,  the Government of Nepal approved  the National Framework on LAPA,  becoming the first country to formalize  LAPA as a national planning framework.  With LAPAs, Nepal hopes to use a  national framework that integrates  top-down with bottom-up approaches,  mainstreams adaptation into  development planning at both the  national and local levels, encourages  participation, identifies local adaptation  needs, and strengthens institutional  mechanisms for ensuring coordinated  adaptation responses (Chaudhury et  al. 2014; Wiseman and Chhetri 2011).  Various national and local agencies  are linked for the delivery of adaptation  resources, with projects that will  lessen the impacts of climate change  on vulnerable communities and help  them build the capacity to tackle future  impacts (Chaudhury et al. 2014). So  far, 70 LAPAs have been completed  and a further 30 are under development  (Chaudhury et al. 2014).  In 2012, Pakistan introduced its own  version of the LAPA, at a project level,  through the Climate Leadership for  Effective Adaptation and Resilience  (CLEAR) project undertaken by  Leadership for Environment and  Development (LEAD) Pakistan, a  nonprofit organization (Chaudhury  et al. 2014). Pakistan’s approach to  developing LAPAs demonstrates the  ability of a local, bottom-up process to  be tailored to targeted groups. Pakistan  uses LAPAs to focus planning efforts  on the most vulnerable districts in the  southern part of the country prone to  floods, cyclones, and drought. CLEAR  is taking a decentralized bottom-up  approach by engaging local partner  organizations from the inception of  the process to develop the LAPAs  to address the impacts of the most  pressing climate change challenges  relevant to local communities. LEAD  facilitates the process by creating an  enabling environment and providing  technical backstopping.  BOX 37 | NEPAL AND PAKISTAN’S LOCAL ADAPTATION PLANS OF ACTION   Community-based adaptation (CBA) recognizes  that small communities are likely to be the most  affected by climate change impacts, least equipped to  adapt to these changes but best placed to determine  locally appropriate long-term plans. CBA recognizes  that all people play an essential role in planning,  implementing, monitoring, and evaluating solutions  to adaptation. Bolivia (Box 38) has used the CBA  model to inform its adaptation planning, integrating  it into its national development planning. Bolivia’s  example demonstrates that ensuring extensive  public engagement in the policymaking process and  investing in improved methods of communication  can build interconnectedness among communities,  which, in itself, strengthens adaptive capacity.  By providing opportunities for the development of  such social resources, governments can facilitate  coordination and cooperation among communities,  enable collective action to provide safety nets in  times of crisis, and develop mechanisms to share  other forms of capital (WRI et al. 2011).  Because local adaptation plans and vulnerability  assessments will need to be embedded in larger  national strategies, it is also important to think  Bolivia contributes only a small fraction of global  GHG emissions (roughly 0.3 percent), so it focuses  its efforts more on climate change adaptation than on  mitigation. To reduce its vulnerability to climate change,  Bolivia has undertaken a series of community-based  adaptation (CBA) projects in conjunction with local  and national nongovernmental organizations, United  Nations Volunteers, and the United Nations Development  Programme. It is funded through the Global Environment  Facility’s Small Grants Programme. (UNDP 2014a; State  of Bolivia 2012).  Participatory approaches are required in all Bolivia’s  climate change adaptation actions (State of Bolivia  2012, 48). Accordingly, Bolivia prioritized its adaptation  projects based, in part, on participatory consultations  (Devisscher and Smith 2008). Bolivia employs a  participatory approach across all six of its CBA  projects, to “strengthen the communities’ resiliency to  climate change through awareness-raising workshops  and capacity-building activities on natural resource  management” (UNDP 2014b, 2).  Bolivia’s indigenous population participates in a CBA  project to reduce deforestation by sustainably harvesting  forest products (State of Bolivia 2012). Another CBA  project, which aims to protect water resources for  irrigation and drinking water, includes communities in the  process of identifying “alternatives for the establishment  and location of irrigation systems” (UNDP 2014c, 2).  Bolivia is now one of 10 countries, including Bangladesh,  Guatemala, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Namibia, Niger,  Samoa, and Vietnam, that implement projects integrating  the concept of CBA in conjunction with UNDP (UNDP  2014c, 2). UNDP’s support of community-based projects  seeks to enhance the resiliency of small, highly vulnerable  communities and the ecosystems on which they rely, to  climate change impacts. It aims to create small-scale policy  laboratories and generate knowledge about how to achieve  adaptation at the local level (UNDP 2014c, 2).  BOX 38 | BOLIVIA’S PARTICIPATORY  APPROACH TO ADAPTATION  Because much of the Netherlands lies below sea  level, the country has a long history of adapting to  encroaching seas and flooding. Without the country’s  series of massive dikes, areas below sea level would be  permanently flooded, and 60 percent of the country—  home to 10 million people—would be threatened by  storm surges (Germanwatch 2004).  The Dutch government is integrating its adaptation  policies with spatial planning policies. Integration has  required it to coordinate adaptation projects with local  and municipal authorities. For example, Rotterdam  Climate Initiative works with nongovernmental  organizations and the regional and municipal authorities  in Rotterdam to make the city more climate resilient  (Rotterdam Climate Initiative 2013). Projects undertaken  include the augmentation and maintenance of flood  prevention systems on rivers and coasts (OECD 2013).  The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment  has identified local authorities, businesses, knowledge  institutions, and consumers, as well as locally focused  entrepreneurs and civil society organizations, as key  partners in developing local approaches to adaptation  (Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment 2014).  BOX 39 | THE NETHERLANDS LOOKS  AT LOCAL APPROACHES TO ADAPTATION  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up about the relationship between scales. The Netherlands  has attempted to link scales directly and has  built its national adaptation plan around local and  municipal authorities (Box 39).  By focusing national adaptation planning around the  experiences and needs of local communities, the Netherlands  expects to be more able to develop long-term  strategies that will protect the population and generate  momentum across all the relevant stakeholders.  Building International Support for  Climate Resilience, Adaptation, and  Loss and Damage  This section builds on the lessons identified in the  previous sections and recommends ways in which  the international community could help support  and scale up these efforts.  Addressing the Needs of the Most Vulnerable  Vulnerable communities have limited capacity to  engage in policymaking, and they risk being overlooked  if their needs are not explicitly included  in planning. To meet their needs, international  support should enable countries to establish   decision-making processes that ensure the participation  of all members of the community, particularly  those most vulnerable and least represented in  formal  decision-making structures. Such support  must recognize that specialized efforts will need  to be invested in engaging particular communities,  including women, indigenous peoples, people  with disabilities, youth and the elderly, and others.  The development of national adaptation plans is a  particularly important area for support, but support  must also be directed toward planning efforts at  regional or local levels.  ▪▪Support and capacity building from bilateral  and multilateral finance sources should enable  NAPs to focus on particularly vulnerable populations  and the needs of future generations within  countries. Outreach and participation will help  to ensure substantial input to the NAPs by those  populations, but efforts should be made to increate  community or locally based adaptation  methods into national planning processes.  ▪▪Regional organizations or agencies should  incorporate the adaptation planning of their  member countries into their development or  adaptation strategies. Where appropriate, communities  whose ethnic ties or pastoral lifestyles  cross national boundaries might benefit from  adaptation planning at the regional level involving  more than one country.  ▪▪The UNFCCC should provide guidance on creating  a vulnerability screen for use within NAPs  that would identify communities with particular  vulnerability. This screen could address a range  of factors contributing to vulnerability including  gender, income disparities, cultural and  social marginalization, and legal status.  ▪▪The UNFCCC should encourage the development  of LAPAs in conjunction with NAPS and NAPAs,  and provide guidance to promote best practice  and participatory approaches, which focus on the  needs of the most vulnerable communities.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources must be designed to ensure that it  reaches local communities and targets the most  vulnerable. Financing mechanisms must be designed  to enable projects to be implemented by  the most vulnerable and disadvantaged countries  and communities, tailoring approaches  to context-specific needs, and capitalizing on  communities’ values and strengths.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources should support sustained, longterm  (10 years or more) monitoring focused on  the impacts of adaptation efforts on vulnerable  populations. Also, national communications to  the UNFCCC can be used to identify relevant  information about particularly vulnerable  groups and populations and include long-term  monitoring of adaptation activities and program-  wide impacts on capabilities.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral or bilateral  sources should have social and environmental  safeguards ensuring that the most vulnerable  or marginalized are not negatively affected by  adaptation finance.   ▪▪Efforts to assess potential impacts on social  or cultural capabilities should be included  in vulnerability and impact assessments for  sector-specific policymaking. Mapping the  social support systems of communities, particularly  the most vulnerable, can provide insight  into where climate impacts or poorly designed  climate policies are most likely to hinder those  support systems.  Research is Needed for Long-Term  Adaptation Strategies  Despite the importance of resilience and adaptation  strategies, current research efforts are not  adequate to inform effective policy design and plan  for longer-term demand. For instance, very few indepth  long-term evaluations of adaptation efforts  have been conducted or widely disseminated. Similarly,  several key sectors for vulnerable populations,  including climate-resilient agriculture and affordable  climate-resilient and low-carbon building,  remain underresearched globally. Greater efforts  to channel and leverage international research  activities are needed to draw sufficient attention  to these systematically underexamined areas. It is  also essential that such research be conducted with  vulnerable communities to ensure that it resonates  with their core needs and builds on existing practices  and knowledge.  ▪▪Research funders, including bilateral, multilateral  and private foundation funders, should set  aside resources specifically targeted at research  with particularly vulnerable populations. The  benefits of such research must flow to these  communities.  ▪▪Research activities with a focus on the coproduction  of knowledge with vulnerable communities  and populations including women  and indigenous communities should seek to  respect and take account of existing knowledge  to ensure that outcomes are appropriate and  effective.  ▪▪Financial support from multilateral and bilateral  sources should support knowledge generation  of climate risks, through prioritizing  projects that enable risk management tools  to be developed for those regions or countries  most vulnerable.  ▪▪As part of its assessment reports, the IPCC  should systematically identify and communicate  research gaps with special attention to  those research areas particularly relevant for  the least well off or most vulnerable. Such areas  include research specifically exploring affordable  climate-resilient building, climate-resilient  agriculture, disaster planning and recovery, and  long-term loss and damage assessments.  ▪▪Assessments of adaptation policy actions  should be systematically collected and distributed  by the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee to  spread effective practices and avoid repetition  of policy choices with unintended consequences  for the most vulnerable.  Loss and Damage Are Likely  The IPCC has recently acknowledged the limits of  adaptation, by asserting that “greater rates and  magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood  of exceeding adaptation limits” and that  “residual loss and damage will occur from climate  change despite adaptation and mitigation action”  (Klein et al. 2014, 903). Knowledge of such limits  is therefore important not only to “inform the level  and timing of mitigation needed” but also to inform  decisionmakers on how best to cope with the  residual impacts of loss and damage. The IPCC has  gone further to state that insufficient responses to  emerging impacts are already eroding the basis for  sustainable development (Klein et al. 2014, 903).  Action must be taken to plan for the effects of slowonset  climate impacts and the increased probabilities  of high-impact climate-related events. It is possible  that long-term development of capabilities, such as  educational opportunities and economic diversification,  could reduce the likelihood of serious loss in  vulnerable communities. Strategic, long-term thinking  about equitable approaches to loss and damage  will necessarily be community specific, and entail  considerable planning and option exploration.  National loss and damage scoping studies can  help with planning  Building on international experience with the  creation of national adaptation plans, vulnerable  countries should be supported to create and submit  “national loss and damage scoping studies” that  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up assess long-term effects of climate change. These  studies should identify specific loss and damage  concerns with particular attention to the most  vulnerable and least well off communities. Like the  NAPs, these scoping studies should empower local  communities and national governments to design  appropriate responses to profound climate impacts.  They should also have a future-oriented component  that identifies potential threats and challenges  from climate change, and lays out potential strategies  for building capabilities and options over the  long-term.  The goal of the scoping studies is to identifiy particular  concerns; build capacity for identifying and  evaluating site-specific loss and damage considerations;  and start a process of long-term planning and  strategizing to address loss and damage as equitably  as possible. Over time, these studies could also provide  a basis for requesting and distributing support.  ▪▪Countries should be supported in conducting  national loss and damage scoping studies, similar  to the current NAP process. Scoping studies  should have a future-oriented component that  seeks to find opportunities and strategies for  enhancing long-term capabilities. This futureoriented  component could build on several  possible techniques, including participatory  visioning and futures scenario building and assessment.  These strategies should explicitly lay  out how they will build capabilities and address  the vulnerability of particular groups to loss  and damage.  ▪▪Support should be made available for the  initial scoping study and to establish relevant  baseline and iterative monitoring focused on  particularly vulnerable and marginalized communities,  including the least well off and future  generations. Planning should also be started for  financing to address impacts identified through  monitoring.  ▪▪National loss and damage scoping studies  should be used to inform decisions about financial  support for loss and damage.  Coordinate multilateral efforts  In 2015, several other global processes of direct  relevance to loss and damage will reach important  milestones. They include the Hyogo Framework for  Action under the United Nations Office for Disaster  Risk Reduction (UNISDR), and the Nansen Initiative  on disaster-induced crossborder displacement.  The UNFCCC should seek to coordinate loss and  damage efforts with these initiatives. For example,  the Hyogo Framework priorities and the Nansen  Initiative principles should influence the frameworks  used to structure national loss and damage  scoping studies. To the extent possible, scoping  studies and future reporting to the loss and damage  mechanism should build on reports to the Hyogo  Framework to prevent unduly burdensome reporting  requirements on vulnerable countries.  Identifying the most  vulnerable populations  or communities, at the  intersection of physical  climate impacts and  social vulnerability,  is among the most  important challenges in  developing adaptation  policies and climate risk  management systems.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up CLIMATE EQUITY,  CAPABILITIES AND  THE 2015 AGREEMENT  This chapter uses the capabilities approach to establish a framework  to address equity in the 2015 agreement through determining the  content of countries’ intended nationally determined contributions  and the agreement itself. The capabilities approach becomes useful  in designing and evaluating country contributions by defining and  establishing basic guidelines for equitable climate change response.  In terms of the international agreement, this approach helps to  identify pathways to enhance capabilities and achieve equity at the  national level through multiple elements of the 2015 agreement.   The new international climate agreement to be  concluded at the end of 2015 is a critical opportunity  to make significant progress toward the goal  of minimizing the risks of climate change. Ideally,  the 2015 Agreement would establish a framework  that facilitates rapid and ambitious mitigation  efforts, effectively supports adaptation and address  loss and damage from climate impacts in the short  term, and lays a foundation for deeper action on all  fronts to protect future generations. Chapters 2 and  3 identified a range of ways that the international  community could support domestic actions that  build capabilities while addressing climate action.  In this section we focus on the opportunity to  address equity in the 2015 Agreement. Equity has  always been central to international policy efforts,  and as noted earlier, the UNFCCC mandate to  reach a 2015 Agreement that is “applicable to all  Parties” and is also “under the Convention” has  further emphasized the equity questions facing  parties. Without an effective approach to equity, the  2015 Agreement is unlikely to build the necessary  consensus to enable strong and ambitious commitments,  and may not be concluded at all.  Two core processes toward the proposed 2015  Agreement present opportunities for addressing  equity, both of which can be advanced based on  an understanding of capabilities. The first is the  process of determining the content of countries’  intended NDCs. The second is determining the  content of the agreement as a whole.  In forming the 2015 Agreement, the capability  approach stresses the importance of prioritizing  the identification of concrete pathways of achieving  climate action and well-being. As seen in Chapters 2  and 3, designing and implementing climate actions  that build capabilities requires a range of resources  and commitments. Mitigation objectives, adaptation  and loss and damage, finance, capacity building,  technology, and transparency and accountability are  all essential elements of climate action, and thus all  must be reflected in the 2015 Agreement. For each  of these elements, recognizing the relationships  between climate action and capabilities is a central  tool for using the 2015 Agreement to advance transformative  changes toward human well-being and  equity in a context of climate change.  Consider Equity in Formulating  Nationally Determined Contributions  In the 2015 negotiations, intended NDCs form the  central mechanism for determining and communicating  national commitments to climate action.  Determining what types of actions individual countries  will take and how much they will do—both in  terms of the aggregate level of action undertaken by  UNFCCC Parties and in terms of countries’ national  levels of action—is a core equity issue. A capabilities  approach is useful in this conversation because it  establishes basic guidelines about what an equitable  response to climate change would look like  in the aggregate. In addition, using the concept of  respective capabilities can provide a framework that  informs how each country’s contributions should be  determined according to equity.  The process for setting those contributions is a  hybrid one, combining national proposals for actions  with the overarching framework of the Convention.  The process will begin by those Parties ready to  do so, communicating their intended NDCs to the  UNFCCC Secretariat by the first quarter of 2015 and  those remaining at least “well in advance” of COP 21  (UNFCCC 2013b). In accordance with the decision  made by the Parties in Warsaw, the information  that Parties may provide with their intended NDCs  was agreed upon at COP 20 in Lima (UNFCCC  2014). While the provision of this information is  not mandatory, Parties did agree an indicative list  of information that could form the basis of Parties’  intended NDCs. Of particular relevance, is the invitation  in paragraph 14 for Parties to include how it  ”considers that its intended nationally determined  contribution is fair and ambitious, in light of its  national circumstances, and how it contributes  towards achieving the objective of the Convention  as set out in its Article 2” (UNFCCC 2014).  Despite many Parties pushing for a formal review  and assessment phase to follow communication of  the intended NDCs (see, for example, Africa Group  2013; Africa Group 2014; Mexico 2014; CAN International  2013), no ex ante assessment was agreed in  the Lima Call for Climate Action (UNFCCC 2014).  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up In light of both decisions at COP 20, as countries formulate  their intended NDCs, this report proposes that  a core bundle of national capabilities should be central  to the factors used to define and evaluate the equitability  of countries’ contributions. These national  capabilities, described in Chapter 1 and building off  the capabilities approach developed throughout this  report, can be used to put into practice and enhance  the respective capabilities aspect of the CBDR-RC  principle in the Convention. National capabilities  can be useful as a means to consider the degree to  which countries are able to take climate action and to  identify opportunities for climate action to contribute  to domestic development priorities.  Capabilities need not become the sole framework  for pursuing climate equity. Responsibility for  climate change, including historical responsibility,  remains fundamental to shaping global climate  efforts. It is also relevant because of the role that  emissions have played in causing significant climate  impacts and affecting the capabilities of countries  and particularly vulnerable populations.  Accordingly, we propose that intended NDCs  be formulated and evaluated in terms of the  following factors:  ▪▪Emissions responsibility, including historical,  current, and projected emissions both in per  capita and aggregate terms  ▪▪National capabilities, including:  □□ human development;  □□ economic capacity, including consideration  of the relative costs of climate action and  the economic benefits from taking climate  action;  □□ resilience to climate impacts, including  physical security and capacity to adapt in  the face of climate change; and  □□ governance capacity and social support  structures  The level of these four country capabilities can be  assessed using specific quantitative and qualitative  metrics, shown in Table 6 below and introduced  earlier in Chapter 1, Table 3. These metrics can help  assess the relative strength of different countries’  capabilities to determine the level and types of  action they could take. Using capabilities in this way  reflects the many dimensions of equity and expressly  acknowledges the differences among countries,  though differences between developed and developing  countries are still quite evident. Together with  emissions indicators, these indicators can be instructive  in assessing the degree and types of actions that  countries can undertake. Although incorporating  these indicators should not provide an exact answer  to the question of what type and level of action a  country should take, it can help provide the basis  for a constructive examination and decision making  process regarding intended NDCs.    When communicating their intended NDCs in  accordance with the requirements of the Lima Call  for Climate Action, Parties should explain how their  countries’ proposed actions compare with other  countries’ in terms of equity, based on the factors  and indicators described earlier. This consideration  of equity should be undertaken together with  assessment of the countries’ technical and economic  opportunities for mitigation action and how the  countries’ actions contribute to the collective global  goal of keeping temperature rise below 2o C.  Along with other upfront information, such as that  regarding sectors and gases covered in emissions  plans, countries should indicate the specific criteria  and factors they use in determining the equitability  of their contribution, as well as how the contribution  fits into a global level of ambition to reduce  emissions. (Levin et al. 2014).  Formulating Policies and Actions in National  Contributions  Incorporating equity factors into the formulation  and assessment of intended NDCs, both during  2015 as well as in the 2015 Agreement, can help  determine the type and level of contributions a  country should make.  Mitigation in Intended Nationally Determined  Contributions  In the case of mitigation, this approach would suggest  that developed countries and others with the most  robust capabilities should take on emission reduction  targets that clearly link to the global stabilization levels  required to avoid further climate impacts. To reach  the level of ambition needed, targets would have to  provide for absolute, economy-wide emissions reductions,  while they could also include specific long-term  goals such as phase-outs of GHGs.  WRI’s CAIT Equity Explorer tool (Box 40) allows  comparison of countries by climate, economic, and  resilience indicators to show the relative level of  action countries could take in each area.  For those countries that have the ability to do so,  based on their capabilities, GHG reduction targets  should be put forward. However, to take account of  policy effects on those who are least well off domestically,  targets can be less comprehensive—such as  emissions intensity targets or emission peak dates—  and will need to be pursued equitably in a domestic  context. Efforts should be taken to avoid future  emissions and enable long-term emission reductions.  For this reason, policies that include building  low-carbon infrastructure—including energy  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up infrastructure—and developing robust land-use  management may be particularly appropriate.  Countries with the lowest capabilities should focus  on seeking opportunities for climate actions that  contribute to national capabilities. This might  include efforts to support renewable energy electrification,  or to enable community forest management.  Of course, the overarching requirement of  sufficient mitigation to protect future capabilities  means that in all cases, countries should commit  to an increasingly ambitious type and level of  contribution; there should be no backsliding from  previous types of commitments such as economy-wide,  absolute emissions targets. Table 7 suggests a  spectrum approach to determine the type of extent  of mitigation contribution that could be proposed  by a range of country Parties.      Source: Adapted from CAIT Equity Explorer, World Resources Institute.  The World Resources Institute has created an online  tool, the CAIT Equity Explorer that can be used to  examine a wide range of equity factors in national  dialogues and  decision-making processes on intended  nationally determined contributions, as well as by  UNFCCC Parties and stakeholders during the review  and assessment phase of these contributions. Tools  such as the CAIT Equity Explorer can assist countries  and other stakeholders in assessing and comparing the  implications of using different dimensions of equity  within intended national contributions.  The factors incorporated in the equity explorer include  emissions, development, vulnerability, relative costs of  action, and benefits of action. It integrates indicators  graphically and enables users to choose the factors they  would like to consider and compare countries’ profiles  based on these indicators. In general, the greater the  area covered in each radar chart, the greater level of  action a country could undertake. As the examples below  highlight, choosing different indicators provides different  perspectives on relative equity among countries.  BOX 40 | CAIT EQUITY EXPLORER   As seen in Table 7, in addition to signaling levels  of effort internationally, defining their intended  NDCs, and reporting on the level of fairness and  ambition, provides countries with an opportunity  to formulate climate actions that are deliberately  designed to build the capabilities of the least well  off and most vulnerable from the bottom-up. In the  case of low-carbon development, the types of lowcarbon  policies highlighted in Chapter 2 could form  the basis of policies and measures that countries  include in their intended NDCs, such as those listed  in Box 40.  Including adaptation in intended NDCs  From a capabilities perspective, mitigation is  not the only dimension that should be included  in intended NDCs. If the goal of intended NDCs  is to create a mechanism capable of identifying  policy efforts and encouraging consistently deeper  national action sufficient to avoid negative climate  impacts for current and future generations, then  adaptation should also be included. This also  reflects the position of a number of developing  country Parties, who are strongly in favor of adaptation  being equally reflected (Environmental Integrity  Group 2014; Mexico 2014).  Given that many countries’ long-term adaptation  plans are not complete, fully incorporating adaptation  may be pragmatically difficult for many Parties  at this stage. However given the importance of  adaptation to capabilities, the intended NDCs could  still provide Parties an opportunity to present their  adaptation planning processes, needs, and contributions.  Adaptation contributions could largely  focus on the national strategy and planning processes  for adaptation (such as to formulate NAPs),  rather than prematurely attempting to articulate  specific actions or outcomes. Parties could include  information about timelines, ministries involved,  and sectors and geographies covered in the NAPs  planning process in each country. Following 2015,  as countries more fully formulate their NAPs and  other adaptation strategies, they could augment  their future adaptation contributions with more  specific information and plans.  Financing nationally determined contributions  Similarly, given that pursuing equitable climate  policies—for either mitigation or adaptation—may  require additional financing, a capabilities approach  would support the inclusion of finance for intended  NDCs to the extent that it is needed for particular  policy shifts. For instance, implementing equitable  fossil-fuel subsidy reform may require an initial  financial investment that countries could note in  their proposed contribution.  Various UNFCCC Parties have suggested that  contributions from developing country Parties  should be enabled and supported by finance from  developed country Parties and that intended NDCs  should reflect the need for and provision of finance  (Least Developed Countries 2014; South Africa  2014). Particularly for countries with limited capabilities,  the proposed national contributions are an  opportunity to highlight their needs for support tied  to specific policy issues identified as useful both for  climate action and for improving well-being. One  approach to addressing this link to finance would be  for developing countries to indicate those activities  and measures they will undertake unconditionally,  without support, and those that will require international  support.  Presenting their contributions in this way would  enable developing countries to assess and communicate  their capabilities and the degree to which  support, including finance and capacity building, is  needed to bolster those capabilities.  Assessing Countries’ Intended Nationally  Determined Contributions  As discussed earlier, equity demands adequate  global mitigation and sufficient adaptation to avoid  further climate-induced reductions in capabilities,  also requiring that climate actions protect or  enhance the capabilities of those who are least well  off or most vulnerable. Together these requirements  provide basic guidance for sufficient global action  in the aggregate over time. Although each country  will determine its own contribution, the capabilities  approach insists that sufficient global action is a  Examples of policies countries might put forth in their  intended nationally determined contributions that  incorporate equitability include:  ▪▪Equitable fossil-fuel subsidy reform with use of fiscal  savings for social benefits such as health and education  ▪▪Carbon pricing systems designed equitably and with  use of revenues for social benefits  ▪▪Renewable energy policies, including feed-in tariffs  and off-grid distributed renewable systems, designed  to expand energy access and address equity concerns  ▪▪Sustainable transport efforts focused on meeting  transportation access needs for the least well off  ▪▪Community forest rights policies and programs that  enable reductions in deforestation  ▪▪Adaptation planning processes that highlight the  needs and interests of the most vulnerable populations,  including vulnerability screens that take into  account differing capabilities    core requirement for equity. Reviews and synthesis  of the intended NDCs, undertaken either by civil  society or the UNFCCC Secretariat, must therefore  not only consider the range of respective capabilities  and responsibilities, but must also evaluate  them in the aggregate against global needs.  In whatever manner a review process is undertaken,  a capability approach suggests that a  robust assessment is needed to consider whether  countries’ contributions are equitable in relation  to one another, as well as how far they go in meeting  collective goals of keeping global temperature  rise below 2oC. Following the absence of a formal  ex ante assessment process in the Lima Call for  Climate Action, ensuring that the review process  includes a rigorous aggregate assessment will  require contributions from outside the UNFCCC,  such as those from civil society or research institutions  or by an international body such as the United  Nations Environment Programme.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up Promoting Capabilities through Multiple  Elements of the 2015 Agreement  As shown in Chapters 2 and 3, achieving sufficient  climate action that protects and builds capabilities  in the long run necessarily requires a wide range of  political, institutional, and financial support. These  needs cut across all elements of the 2015 Agreement.  While the intended NDCs are a central tool for defining  and communicating country contributions, each of  the broader elements of a 2015 agreement—including  mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology, transparency  and accountability, and capacity building—play  a role in creating a foundation for climate action  that will achieve climate stabilization and protect or  enhance capabilities in the long term. This section  uses the capabilities approach as a lens to identify  what would be required to promote the long-term  goals of the UNFCCC in each of these key elements of  a 2015 Agreement, both the resulting legal text as well  as any accompanying decisions of the COP.  Focus Adaptation Policies on the  Most Vulnerable Populations  As described in Chapter 3, the need to adapt to the  effects of climate change and address impacts on the  most vulnerable populations is a central equity concern.  A capabilities approach highlights the role that  well-designed adaptation policies can play in protecting  and increasing the well-being of those populations.  The Convention recognizes the importance of  adaptation for human well-being (UNFCCC 1992). In  recent years, the Cancun Adaptation Framework and  the process for developing national adaptation plans  have underscored the importance of an emphasis on  building resilience to climate impacts, especially in an  integrated fashion with broader development objectives  (UNFCCC 2011a; LDC Expert Group 2012).  The Cancun Adaptation Framework provides that  “[E]nhanced action on adaptation should be undertaken  in accordance with the Convention, should  follow a country driven, gender-sensitive, participatory  and fully transparent approach, taking into  consideration vulnerable groups, communities, and  ecosystems, and should be based on and guided  by the best available science, and, as appropriate,  traditional and indigenous knowledge, with a view to  integrating adaptation into relevant social, economic  and environmental policies and actions, where  appropriate” (UNFCCC 2010, sec. II, para. 12).  The negotiation process for the 2015 Agreement,  including accompanying COP decisions, provides an  opportunity to build on this framework by promoting  accelerated implementation of adaptation action,  with a central focus on particularly vulnerable populations.  To drive this implementation and send clear  long-term policy signals to key actors—including  national and local governments, international institutions,  the private sector and civil society—the 2015  Agreement should include a long-term adaptation  goal that focuses attention on the most vulnerable  populations and the need to undertake adaptation in  ways that address their basic capabilities (Okereke,  Baral and Dagnet 2014).  Effectively pursuing this goal will depend on  widening the use of vulnerability assessments that  address the intersection of climate impacts with  economic, social, gender, and other factors. NAPs,  other adaptation plans, and adaptation finance  strategies will need to use these types of assessments  to prioritize pathways for addressing impacts  on the most vulnerable. This will require attention  to a wide range of development priorities—including  health, habitation, and water—and attention to  the ways in which adaptation must be integrated  with overarching development strategies and plans.  As Chapter 3 described, adaptation approaches must  be highly specific to particular localities and populations,  and effective adaptation planning and assessment  processes require participatory processes and  local engagement. Therefore, the 2015 Agreement  should emphasize the importance of participatory  approaches and ensure that countries receive the support  needed, including finance and technical assistance,  to undertake this engagement. While developing  countries are clearly the focus for most of this  effort, adaptation and resilience building also should  address the effects of climate change on particularly  vulnerable populations in developed countries.  Finally, the 2015 Agreement should also explicitly  acknowledge the inherent relationship between  the level of mitigation pursued by countries and  the resulting effects on capabilities as emissions  rise and climate change accelerates. To put this  recognition into practice, the agreement should  include a process to assess the degree to which the  need for adaptation measures will be affected by  the expected level of mitigation that countries will   undertake and the temperature trajectory that will  result. In addition, the agreement should provide  for an assessment of the extent to which adaptation  efforts underway are successfully addressing existing  and projected adaptation needs. Such assessment  processes can be part of the regular cycles  of action in the agreement, and Parties should be  encouraged in future cycles to submit descriptions  of their adaptation efforts informed by NAPs and  other national adaptation plans as those reach  completion (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak 2014).  Specific recommendations for building capabilities  through adaptation and resilience in the 2015  Agreement process:  ▪▪The Parties to the UNFCCC should use the  2015 Agreement to reaffirm and further implement  key provisions in the Cancun Adaptation  Framework, which states that adaptation  “should follow a country driven, gendersensitive,  participatory and fully transparent  approach, taking into consideration vulnerable  groups, communities, and ecosystems.”  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should include an adaptation  goal that emphasizes the need to undertake  adaptation and build resilience for the most  vulnerable populations. The agreement should  encourage all countries, including developed  countries, to develop adaptation and resilience  strategies for their most vulnerable populations.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should explicitly recognize  the relationship between the level of global  mitigation effort and the adaptation response  needed and assess the resulting adaptation  need on a regular basis.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the  importance of participatory planning approaches  in developing NAPs and other adaptation plans,  to ensure substantial input by those populations  that are most vulnerable and least represented.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should ensure that support  and capacity building will enable developing  countries to continue to develop NAPS and  other adaptation strategies in conjunction with  other development strategies, including regular  updates on a nationally determined schedule.  ▪▪To address adaptation needs, the 2015 Agreement  should support shifting international public  finance to a fully balanced allocation so that  adaptation receives an equal level of funding  compared with mitigation.  ▪▪Countries’ national communications to the  UNFCCC provide an opportunity for developing  countries to identify and communicate the  needs of specific populations.  Loss and damage caused by climate change  impacts is already being experienced and, even  with significant mitigation efforts, more impacts  will occur based on already emitted GHGs (IPCC  2013). Addressing loss and damage is essential in  an equitable climate regime because of the unequal  impacts that will be faced by the most vulnerable,  despite their having contributed the least  emissions. One of the key outcomes of COP 19 in  Warsaw was the establishment of an international  mechanism to address loss and damage experienced  by developing countries. The Warsaw International  Mechanism for Loss and Damage (Loss  and Damage Mechanism) was established under  the Cancun Adaptation Framework and is intended  to examine and find ways to address climate-related  extreme and slow-onset events occurring or likely  to occur in developing countries that are particularly  vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate  change (UNFCCC 2013b).  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the  need for cooperation toward achieving universal  access to climate information, including  early-warning systems, weather stations, and  agriculture-relevant climate information.  ▪▪The COP should provide guidance to the governing  bodies of the Loss and Damage Mechanism,  the Technology Mechanism and the  Financial Mechanism of the UNFCCC should be  encouraged to look for opportunities to support  countries with lower capabilities to access innovative  information technologies necessary to  support vulnerable populations.  ▪▪The COP should support the development of  national loss and damage scoping studies,  highlighting the importance of addressing loss  and damage through a permanent but dynamic  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up process in countries. These scoping studies  would assess the current and future impacts  of climate change leading to loss and damage  and approaches to deal with those effects in  each country.  ▪▪The COP should recognize the need for collaboration  and coordination among the Loss and  Damage Mechanism and other United Nations  disaster risk reduction programs, such as the  Hyogo Framework for Action under the United  Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction  and the Nansen Initiative on disaster-induced  cross-border displacement.  Target Finance to Build Capabilities  Climate finance will be essential to the task of  undertaking equitable climate action in line with a  capabilities approach. To support capabilities, and  address equity in climate finance, the 2015 Agreement  can play three key roles:  ▪▪Create the post-2020 framework necessary to  generate the level of finance and investment  needed to pursue low-carbon development and  to build resilience and adapt to climate impacts,  based on countries’ capabilities  ▪▪Send a strong policy signal to financial institutions  that finance and investment should  be directed toward equitable climate action  that builds capabilities, such as those policies  described in Chapters 2 and 3, and that finance  should be accessible to those who are least well  off and most vulnerable  ▪▪Promote the alignment of development finance  with climate objectives to ensure that development  priorities are implemented in a way that  builds capabilities in a changing climate.  Generating the finance and investment needed  The recent report of the Global Commission on the  Economy and Climate demonstrated that climate  action can provide substantial economic benefits.  With US$90 trillion set to be invested globally in  urban, land-use, and energy infrastructure in the  next 15 years, numerous opportunities are available  to advance low-carbon development at relatively  low cost, including in countries with lower levels of  capabilities (Global Commission on the Economy  and Climate, 2014).  Yet for many developing countries, upfront investment  to pursue low-carbon pathways will still be  necessary; the investment needed to achieve the  level of mitigation and adaptation necessary to protect  future generations from the impacts of climate  change is several orders of magnitude larger than  what current financial flows, public and private, can  provide. It has been estimated that between now  and 2050, developing countries alone will require  an additional $531 billion per year of investment  in energy supply and demand technologies to  keep average global temperature rise below 2oC  (Polycarp, Brown, and Fu-Bertaux 2013). Climate  finance flows to developing countries currently total  $165 billion annually, though only $34 billion of  that total comes from developed countries (Climate  Policy Initiative 2014).  Financial support is needed to enable the kinds of  policies described in Chapters 2 and 3. In many cases,  shifts to low-carbon energy, transport, and infrastructure  and the implementation of effective adaptation  and resilience actions will require significant upfront  investment. However, many of the countries in which  these efforts will be necessary will be unable to finance  them directly. Addressing these finance needs so that  those countries with less robust national capabilities  can take climate action will depend on the new international  agreement catalyzing a scale-up of various types  of finance in the post-2020 timeframe. The financial  pathways needed to support the commitments made  under the 2015 Agreement include direct international  grants, concessional and nonconcessional lending,  guarantees to reduce the risk in innovative investments,  and the involvement of the private sector, including  small and medium enterprises.  To ensure that finance is available to enhance the  capabilities of countries and communities, the  2015 Agreement must create a new framework for  post-2020 climate finance. The goal agreed to at  Copenhagen and Cancun to mobilize $100 billion in  climate finance annually by 2020 sets an important  initial benchmark for the 2015 Agreement to use as a  floor for climate finance in the post-2020 period. The  2015 Agreement can also set another key marker for  post-2020 finance by identifying targets for future  replenishment of the Green Climate Fund.   Beyond these essential elements to set a foundation  on finance, the 2015 Agreement should also link  post-2020 finance to developing countries’ identification  of the finance needed to achieve the nationally  determined contributions they put forward. Developing  country Parties should explicitly be given an  opportunity in their intended NDCs to identify two  sets of policies and actions. The first will include the  level of ambition committed to on the basis of existing  domestic resources and the second, acknowledging  the importance of capabilities, will identify the  increased ambition achievable with international  support. To enable these countries to build their  capabilities and take the enhanced action, finance  commitments in the 2015 Agreement should be  linked to the needs expressed in the intended NDCs,  including a mechanism to ensure that those finance  and investment needs will be met.  To meet these financial commitments, developed  countries remain responsible for supporting  developing countries to undertake climate action,  as laid out in Article 4 of the UNFCCC, and clearly  continue to have a lead responsibility for finance.  Nonetheless, given the shifting global economic  landscape, applying a capabilities approach to  climate finance supports recognition in the 2015  Agreement of the full range of global climate  financial flows, not just from developed to developing  countries. Given their growing capabilities,  many developing countries with relatively robust  capabilities are indicating their readiness to make  financial commitments, either to support significant  South-South financial flows or to contribute to the  capitalization of the Green Climate Fund (see, for  example, Mexico 2014; Marshall Islands 2014;  South Africa 2013; China 2014).  A recurrent theme throughout this report has been  the need for adequate climate finance, beyond  existing North-South flows, to provide the upfront  finance needed to drive equitable climate policies.  Providing the opportunity for all Parties to contribute  is an important first step. The 2015 Agreement  can create the framework for post-2020 climate  finance, by recognizing a range of financial contributions,  including quantitative pledges, targets,  and actions, as well as qualitative commitments on  domestic policies and programs aimed at mobilizing  climate finance. All Parties should be encouraged to  contribute to the global discussion on climate finance  through indicating their intention as to finance in  their intended NDCs, recognizing its importance to  building capabilities and achieving equity.  It is becoming apparent that despite best efforts  to increase global public finance, even ambitious  targets will fall short of the level of finance needed  to shift investments and keep global temperatures  below 2oC. The 2015 Agreement must therefore  play a key role in creating a 2020 framework that  supports and guides long-term involvement of  the private sector in climate finance, particularly  including businesses in developing countries. From  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up a capabilities and equity perspective, this calls for  not just an increase in private-sector investment,  but a focus on ensuring that such investment is  directed toward building the capabilities of the  least well off and most vulnerable. This presents a  particularly unique challenge given the difficulties  in directing private finance and putting safeguards  in place.  The 2015 Agreement, therefore, has a dual role in  promoting equitable private finance. First, it should  galvanize support to ensure public funding flows  are directed, where appropriate, toward leveraging  private-sector investment. The Parties should  agree on the importance of directing such support  toward sectors that provide opportunities to build  capabilities. Critically, the Parties should highlight  the importance of financing developing-country  businesses—especially reducing risk for small and  medium enterprises—as a way to support innovation  and build capabilities. Second, it must also  highlight the importance of targeting public funding  toward projects for which private funding is  likely to remain scare: historically, adaptation and  resilience projects in low-income countries (which  receive just 2.5 percent of foreign direct investment  to developing countries). While concessional  lending and leveraging the private sector may be  appropriate for developing countries that have  greater capabilities, those with lower capabilities  may still require substantial grant-based finance.  Directing the finance to build capabilities  The challenge for climate finance goes much further  than just finding more money; it is also fundamentally  a governance challenge. Tackling climate  change will require transformational approaches  that accelerate the shift to low-carbon pathways  and bolster climate resilience in ways that are also  fully integrated with efforts to build capabilities and  enhance equity. The 2015 agreement can play an  important role by providing guidance to multilateral  and bilateral finance institutions, including the  GCF, to focus attention on these types of policies.  This includes ensuring that finance and investment  is available for the types of climate actions  described in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report. A  range of financial instruments should be provided  to enable developing countries to pursue low-carbon  policies that take equity into account and help  build capabilities, such as those described earlier  involving fossil-fuel subsidy reform, carbon pricing,  renewable energy provision, sustainable transport  and community forest protection (Polycarp, Brown,  and Fu-Bertaux 2013).  At the same time, finance should be provided for  adaptation focused on building the resilience of  the most vulnerable populations and taking into  account the social and economic contexts that affect  capabilities and vulnerability.   In addition, those requiring finance in many policy  areas are likely to be “nontraditional” recipients,  including women, low-income people, indigenous  peoples and otherwise vulnerable or marginalized  communities. As highlighted in this report, individuals  within these communities have the potential to  develop effective and locally appropriate solutions  but first require access to finance. Financial institutions  should enable these communities to access  funds and enable them to innovate, take risks  and build locally appropriate enterprises to drive  solutions essential to building capabilities and the  achievement of equity.  The orientation of international public finance  can also play a critical role in leveraging domestic  support to enable institutional capacity building  and buy-in within countries. Thinking more broadly  about the role of climate finance in increasing  capabilities supports a model of climate finance that  supports full recipient country ownership. Accordingly,  finance must be prioritized toward readiness  and capacity-building strategies that build longterm  national and subnational institutions and  systems (Polycarp, Brown, and Fu-Bertaux 2013).  This also includes delivering and implementing  climate finance in line with national low-carbon  and adaptation strategies and plans, as well as  providing support for developing and updating  those plans as needed. In addition, a capabilities  approach entails providing support for government  capacity to develop and oversee policies, build linkages  among ministries and with local government,  and engage the private sector and civil society. To  achieve this, continued support will be essential for  finance mechanisms that enable countries to steer  the strategic direction of finance implementation,  including national finance strategies, and to have  direct access to finance.  Aligning development finance with climate objectives  In addition to leveraging “new and additional”  finance and increasing the accessibility of climate  finance, the 2015 Agreement provides the opportunity  to further align existing development finance  with climate objectives. To date, financing for  climate and development has been institutionally  fragmented despite significant obvious overlaps in  investment needs.  Close to one quarter of all development assistance  currently goes to sectors that are highly relevant  to climate change because they are highly climate  sensitive or offer sizeable mitigation opportunities:  $11.4 billion of total overseas development  assistance in 2011 was for the energy sector, $10.7  billion for agriculture, and $12.6 billion for transport  (OECD 2014).  As the climate changes, development aid must take  into account climate impacts and hazards and plan  accordingly, particularly to build the long-term  capabilities of individuals and communities. Aligning  development finance would not entail shifting  funds from development to climate purposes, but  rather investing those funds in ways that ensure  that both development aims and climate objectives  are met. For instance, investments in the water  sector or agriculture can be made with climate  resilience embedded. Infrastructure investments  can be made in ways that encourage low-carbon  approaches and also help ensure resilience.  Key recommendations for a proposed framework  within the 2015 Agreement to ensure that climate  finance is adequate, addresses equity considerations,  and incorporates an emphasis on capabilities are:  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should link the finance  to be provided in the post-2020 period with  the finance needs communicated in developing  countries’ national plans and intended NDCs to  strengthen their capabilities.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should provide for and  recognize financial contributions coming from  a range of countries, including developing  countries in a position to do so based on their  capabilities.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should also urge that  adaptation and climate resilience finance be  directed toward the most vulnerable populations,  possibly by using social and economic  vulnerability criteria.  ▪▪The COP should emphasize the importance of  integrating considerations of climate risk and  vulnerability assessments into future development  aid. Furthermore, it should highlight the  importance of developing guiding principles  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up for international development finance, which  explicitly consider linkages to climate finance  and harmonization of approaches.  ▪▪The COP should emphasize the importance of  providing support for country readiness and the  development of long-term national institutions  and strategies as a way to enhance national  capabilities.  ▪▪In providing guidance to the Green Climate  Fund and Global Environment Facility, the COP  should emphasize the need to support countries  to undertake equitable climate policies, such  as those involving fossil-fuel subsidy reform,  carbon pricing, sustainable transport, and  renewable energy deployment. The COP should  also highlight the need for climate finance to  be accessible to nontraditional banking populations  including the poor, women, and other  marginalized groups.  Build Capacity to Strengthen Capabilities  Many governments in countries where capabilities  are limited are still unable to undertake the  analysis, planning, and coordination they need to  formulate and undertake climate actions (UNFCCC  2014). Moreover, the private sector and civil society  often require training and technical assistance to  effectively pursue low-carbon and climate-resilient  activities. Many factors have contributed to the  absence of effective capacity building, including  a lack of long-term funding and commitment by  financial institutions and governments (GEF 2013).  Given the ongoing concerns about capacity building,  addressing the need for enhanced capacity is  a fundamental condition for success in the effort  to shift to low-carbon and climate-resilient economies  and for building the capabilities of countries.  Robust capacity-building efforts can further the  integration of a capabilities approach across all  elements of the 2015 Agreement. The agreement  provides the opportunity to address the obstacles  to effective capacity building and build greater  international consensus and consistency in funding  and commitment.  To meet these objectives, the 2015 Agreement  should establish a dedicated capacity building facility  (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak 2014). The facility  would act as a focal point to design, coordinate,  support, and manage all capacity building activities  under the UNFCCC. This would include support for  capacity to:  ▪▪Design and implement climate policies and  programs, including both low-carbon pathways  and climate resilience  ▪▪Collect and assess climate data and information,  including emissions data, climate impacts,  effects of climate policies, and implications on  capabilities, particularly for the most vulnerable  and least well off  ▪▪Coordinate effectively across ministries and  among levels of government  ▪▪Engage with and ensure inclusive participation  of civil society, including the most vulnerable  and least well off populations  ▪▪Engage with private sector, including small and  medium enterprises.  In addition, Parties should agree to provide capacity  building through bilateral programs across all areas  of the agreement, including mitigation, adaptation,  technology, and transparency and accountability.  The agreement should also welcome capacity building  and cooperation among developing countries to  enable shared learning and technical assistance.  Use Innovative Technologies to Build Capabilities  The availability of technology is often highly  relevant to building capabilities and undertaking  effective and equitable climate action. The dissemination  and use of low-carbon and climate-resilient  technologies and practices can be essential to the  ability of countries with limited capabilities to take  action. The Convention requires Annex II Parties to  “take all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and  finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or access to,  environmentally sound technologies and know-how  to other Parties, particularly to developing countries  to enable them to implement the provisions of  the Convention” (UNFCCC 1992, Article 4.5).  In 2010, COP 16 in Cancun established the  UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, consisting of two   bodies, the Technology Executive Committee (TEC)  and the Climate Technology Center and Network  (CTCN) (UNFCCC 2010). The Technology Mechanism’s  mandate is geared toward fostering innovation  and technology development as opposed to a  limited focus on technology transfer. It is intended  to promote innovation of environmentally sound  technologies and their diffusion through cooperation  and international partnerships and by enhancing  the ability of developing countries to maintain,  operate, and adapt technologies. However, the  Technology Mechanism has been constrained in  achieving its mandate largely by funding limitations  (Gehl Sampath, Mugabe, and Barton 2012).  In 2013, the UNFCCC Secretariat surveyed the  technology needs of developing countries. For  adaptation, crop management was a priority,  including technologies for crop improvement, new  varieties, and drought-resistant, saline-tolerant and  short-maturing varieties (UNFCCC 2013a) . Mitigation  technologies prioritized included renewable  energy technologies such as solar electricity,  biomass, and biogas, followed by efficient lighting  and wind turbines.  Technologies can be particularly important to  enable the most vulnerable and least well off to  take action (OECD/IEA 2010). As described in  Chapter 2, distributed solar energy technologies  have enabled communities lacking access to gridbased  electricity to achieve improvements in health  and increased economic opportunities for both men  and women. In many instances, such as with rice  cultivation, an innovative practice does not require  sophisticated technology but may require significant  research concerning its efficacy and feasibility  (Oxfam 2014). Furthermore, important technological  innovations for a particular locality may involve  a focus on dissemination of indigenous practices  that have fallen into disuse. Applying a capabilities  approach to understanding technological needs  forces a broader understanding of technology transfer  that highlights the importance of supporting  research, fostering innovation, and identifying and  implementing locally appropriate technology  or know-how.  The ability of developing countries to “leapfrog”  technology innovation and adopt the most innovative  practices depends on technological absorption  capacities and government intervention that may  not be in place (Gallagher, Holdren, and Sagar  2006) . Successful technology projects carefully  select the appropriate technology to transfer, taking  into account the local reality into which the technology  will be transferred and understanding the  capabilities of the potential end users. Successful  implementation will contribute to developing the  country’s capacity to adopt further technological  developments. This approach can enhance capabilities  and enable countries to “assess the need, select,  import, assimilate, adapt and develop the appropriate  technologies” (Kathuria 2002).  From a capabilities perspective, the 2015 Agreement  can play an essential role by emphasizing  the need to build the capabilities and absorptive  capacity of countries so that they can deploy and  use innovative technologies. In particular, attention  must be paid to the implications of specific innovative  technologies for the least well off and most vulnerable  populations. Innovations must be designed,  for example, to allow communities without energy  access to adopt renewable energy on a broader  basis, such as through the use of improved battery  storage technology (Alliance for Rural Electrification  2013). The 2015 Agreement should empower  creation of a dedicated facility for joint research,  development, and deployment (RD&D) programs  with an emphasis on technologies that can be used  by particularly vulnerable or marginal populations.  Recommendations aimed at enhancing the role of  the Technology Mechanism to achieve equitable  and appropriate technology diffusion to those most  vulnerable and least well off include the following:  ▪▪The Technology Mechanism should be anchored  in the 2015 Agreement, ensuring enhanced  action on technology development and  transfer within the ambit and objectives of the  agreement.  ▪▪The Technology Mechanism should be explicitly  empowered to create an RD&D facility with  a focus on fostering innovative technologies  aimed at the most vulnerable and least well off.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should emphasize the importance  of undertaking readiness work, assisting  the recipient country to assimilate potential  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up technologies in a way that builds its long-term  capabilities and enables new technology to be  widely adopted.  ▪▪The COP should explore ways to link the Technology  Mechanism and the Green Climate Fund  to ensure adequate funding for the deployment  of innovative technology and the dissemination  of underused indigenous technologies.  Focus Transparency and Accountability  on Capabilities  Transparency and accountability are essential for a  climate agreement capable of tracking progress and  deepening climate action over time. Identifying and  reporting information on national emissions, on the  effect of mitigation policies, and on financial flows  can provide an important means of building trust  and enabling cooperative action among countries.  The 2015 Agreement provides an opportunity to  establish a goal for a post-2020 measurement,  reporting, and verification (MRV) framework that  moves toward more uniform MRV and facilitates  the evaluation of progress on climate action. It can  also help in providing increased data and information  about the ways in which climate policies  directly affect capabilities in a country.  Despite the importance of implementing a comprehensive  system for MRV, however, the success of  MRV largely depends on the governance capabilities  of the Parties. Parties must have sufficient technical  expertise available, be capable of conducting assessments,  and have the institutional capacity to effectively  manage these processes. Without sufficient  resources, MRV requirements are likely to encumber  already stretched governance systems in many  countries. Such differences in national governance  capabilities means that attempts to include comprehensive  MRV systems in the 2015 Agreement must  factor in the time and resources necessary to support  MRV across diverse national circumstances.  The framework for MRV that emerged from COP in Copenhagen and COP 16 in Cancun provided for  differentiation between developed and developing  countries – “international assessment and review”  for developed countries and “international consultation  and analysis” for developing countries (UNFCCC  2009; UNFCCC 2010). While this differentiated  approach addressed the different capabilities and  national circumstances of developing and developed  countries, it has not yet achieved a more robust common  transparency and MRV framework. A stepwise  approach to implementing a common framework for  all countries is needed, so that developing countries   with greater capabilities adopt these standards  earliest. Successful implementation will also depend  on enhancing the capacity of developing countries,  particularly their governance systems, so that they  are able to effectively participate in MRV.  Meanwhile, greater transparency regarding emissions  and finance can enable increased participation  and engagement in climate policy by civil  society and the private sector, thereby building a  country’s overall capabilities and strengthening  its ability to undertake greater climate action. For  example, calls for transparency about fossil-fuel  subsidies have partially been driven by the idea that  awareness will generate interest and political support  for subsidy reform (Victor 2009b).  Effective transparency systems can be important for  designing, implementing, and evaluating climate  policies that protect or enhance capabilities. If  properly directed and resourced, measurement  and reporting can address the effects of climate  policies on the capabilities of vulnerable or poor  populations, including the benefits of well-designed  policies. Capabilities should be included in the  suite of metrics countries are encouraged to track  and report on. Over time, measuring and tracking  the relationships between climate policies and  the enhancement of specific capabilities will yield  important insights about what actually improved  well-being and what does not. Including capabilities  in the suite of metrics routinely gathered may  require additional support for countries with  limited governance capacity.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should create a stepwise  approach leading to a common MRV framework,  with developing countries with the greatest  capabilities adopting the standards first.  ▪▪Support should be provided to developing  countries to build their national capabilities  and adopt a common framework for MRV.  ▪▪The 2015 Agreement should provide guidance  and ensure support so that developing countries  monitor and report on the ways in which  climate policies have affected the capabilities of  the most vulnerable and least well off.  ▪▪The agreement should also encourage public  access to and dissemination of information,  as well as support to enable that provision of  information (Dominican Republic et al. 2014.)  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up ▪▪The agreement should also encourage countries  to report on current policy environments,  especially on their levels of fossil-fuel subsidies.  Countries can identify prospective ways to  reform those policies that would both achieve  climate objectives and build capabilities, while  they can also seek support for implementation  of those reforms.  Set an Equitable Long-Term Mitigation Goal  While intended NDCs provide an essential mechanism  for making mitigation commitments in the  2015 Agreement, they do not create a long-term  objective for the emissions reductions required for  achieving equity. Some countries have proposed  that the 2015 Agreement include a collective longterm  trajectory for emissions reductions or specific  mitigation actions (UNFCCC 2014b). To be successful,  a long-term goal needs to address capabilities  and equity concerns.  Expressing such a goal as a mitigation objective,  and not only as a temperature threshold, can help  countries identify specific policies and investments  that will contribute to sufficient climate action and  enable countries to ensure that transformation will  have benefits for capabilities. For example, the 2015  Agreement could incorporate a collective global trajectory  for emissions reduction or specific mitigation  actions capable of achieving the level of emission  reductions needed for climate stabilization, such as  phasing out GHG emissions or shifting to predominantly  renewable energy in the second half of the  century (Box 42). Using a capabilities lens to inform  such a goal would require a focus on policies that  can also build capabilities, such as using renewable  energy to increase access to electricity.  In setting such a goal, there must also be a recognition  that countries with differing capabilities  may have to proceed at different paces. A phased  approach would allow countries to take action at  different dates based on their capabilities, while  investment and technology development, cooperation,  and transfer would be essential to enabling  their action. Finance and other support, including  capacity building, will also be needed to help  countries with lower capabilities protect or enhance  the opportunities of those who are least well off and  may be affected by these policies.  To ensure that a long-term mitigation goal takes  into account the capabilities of those who are most  vulnerable or least well off, this long-term goal  should include:  ▪▪A phased approach so that countries would set  a date for phasing out GHG emissions or phasing  in predominantly renewable energy based  on their level of national capabilities.  As the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) report shows, keeping global temperature  rise below 2oC means that only a limited amount of total  greenhouse gases can be emitted into the atmosphere.  The total amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted  is approximately 1,000 PgC, and between 1870 and  2011 the world had already emitted 515 PgC (Collins et  al. 2014). The reality of this carbon budget means that  countries must take action that will substantially reduce  emissions below that total level to avoid catastrophic  climate change.  Many proposals have been made for how the carbon  budget might be divided equitably among countries  in order to set country-specific emissions reduction  objectives. While it is clearly essential to recognize the  overall limits on emissions and to assess who should  undertake what levels and types of emissions reductions,  avoiding catastrophic climate change can also be framed  in terms of the low-carbon transformations that are  needed to achieve adequate mitigation. Doing so can  focus attention on the role of those transformational  actions in building capabilities.  For example, the IPCC has suggested that staying below  2oC requires a substantial increase in low-carbon energy  supplies. Low-carbon energy, which currently accounts  for 30 percent of electricity production, would have to  increase to more than 80 percent by 2050 (Bruckner et  al. 2014). Achieving this level of low-carbon energy can  be undertaken largely through widespread deployment  of renewable energy, which can also provide significant  equity and capability benefits.  Focusing the question of climate action on the mitigation  actions can help concentrate attention on the capabilities  that such actions build and how they can be built.  BOX 42 | CARBON BUDGETS AND  MITIGATION ACTIONS   ▪▪Increased emphasis on technology development,  cooperation, deployment, and transfer so  that countries with limited capabilities would  be able to take on these goals and benefit from  increased capabilities through the deployment  of new technologies.  ▪▪Support for countries with lower capabilities to  conduct vulnerability assessments and identify  specific strategies to avoid unintended consequences  of rapid mitigation transitions.  Cycles of Climate Actions Build Capabilities  There is increasing support among the Parties in  the UNFCCC that a set of cycles of action should  be included in the 2015 Agreement. These cycles  would facilitate a process of increasing ambition at  regular intervals over time (such as every five years)  (UNFCCC 2014b). As emphasized throughout this  report, the effects of climate change are already  growing, and actions taken to date will not prove  adequate to keeping temperature rise below the 2oC  threshold agreed at COP 16 in Cancun (IPCC 2013;  UNEP 2013). From an equity perspective, the 2015  Agreement must establish a foundation for deeper  action on all fronts to protect capabilities for current  and future generations.  To meet these challenges in the long-term, the  2015 Agreement must not only provide a clear  and binding process for increasing ambition, but  a mechanism for reviewing and assessing action  across all its elements (Morgan, Dagnet, and Tirpak  2014). The agreement should provide for global  assessments of progress to date and action needed  to strengthen the multiple dimensions of climate  action that affect capabilities: mitigation, adaptation,  and support (including finance, technology,  and capacity building). In addition to assessing  progress at the aggregate level, these cycles should  include assessments of countries’ actions to date,  their future needs and opportunities for specific  mitigation and adaptation actions, and their  required levels of support to undertake that action.  A specific technical process within the UNFCCC,  such as within the Subsidiary Body on Scientific  and Technical Advice (SBSTA) or a technical panel,  should be established to agree on equity criteria  that can be used to assess proposed national contributions  after 2015. These criteria should include  the national capabilities indicators proposed in this  report, but could also include other indicators, such  as responsibility metrics. This process to agree on  criteria would need to be concluded several years  before the next cycle of commitments commences;  if the cycles are in five year intervals, that process  would need to conclude by 2017 or 2018.  The indicators used to assess national capabilities  (see Tables 3 and 7) could further strengthen this  review process by evaluating countries’ national  capabilities, the impacts of climate change on  capabilities, and the implications of climate action  for those capabilities. Repeatedly returning to  these core indicators will facilitate the evaluation  of progress over time, ensure that contributions are  dynamic and reflect changes in national capabilities,  and maintain pressure to consistently increase  ambition until levels that ensure climate stabilization  and human well-being are reached.  Moreover, to inform the design and implementation  of policies that actively contribute to well-being,  each of the review cycles must include an analysis of  what has actually been accomplished. Again, drawing  on insights from Chapters 2 and 3, specific mitigation  and adaptation policies should be assessed  with an eye to their effect on actual capabilities.  Best practices that facilitate greater well-being,  especially of those who are most vulnerable or least  well off should be particularly supported.  As noted elsewhere in this report, measuring and  tracking vulnerabilities and capabilities is important  for both mitigation and adaptation policies.  Ensuring that a review process reflects the effects  on actual well-being during implementation  processes would be greatly facilitated by ongoing  monitoring of policy implications for individuals  and communities targeted by such policies. Including  these assessments in the review process would  facilitate national and international learning about  best practices and opportunities for designing and  implementing climate actions that increase wellbeing  in the long term.  How to sequence and organize these cycles of  review is a key issue. Because the issues of mitigation,  adaptation, and finance are likely to remain  distinct under the 2015 Agreement, conducting  separate, but connected, reviews may be one  Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up pragmatic approach. Each issue could be reviewed  in ways that enables it to build on the other issues  and reflects the connections between them. For  example, while mitigation goals may be best  addressed within a distinct assessment, adaptation  and finance needs are intimately connected to  mitigation progress and cannot be identified until  emission trajectories are clarified. Working through  these issues in an iterative manner through the  review cycles would allow each to be informed by  action in the other areas.  Achieving Equity in the 2015 Agreement  from a Capabilities Perspective  This report has presented specific strategies that  can be used to enhance equity and capabilities  through climate action at the national level, along  with the ways in which international action can  support those approaches. The 2015 Agreement  can facilitate these strategies and policies and  enable climate action and equity to go hand in  hand. Achieving success will depend on recognizing  and addressing the central role of capabilities—  ensuring that adequate mitigation and adaptation  are undertaken with capabilities at the core, providing  adequate finance aimed at building capabilities,  and integrating equity and capabilities into  areas such as transparency and accountability and  technology. This will enable the 2015 Agreement  to support and facilitate capabilities at the national  level across a range of climate policy areas and  provide a new model for equity, one that can move  past debates to success.  The new international  climate agreement can  facilitate strategies and  policies that enable  climate action and equity  to go hand in hand.    Building Climate Equity: Creating a New Approach from the Ground Up CAPABILITIES AND  LONG-TERM CLIMATE  TRANSFORMATION  As climate impacts continue to increase, a new perspective and  narrative that promotes equity in the context of climate change is  needed. The capabilities approach provides a framework to formulate  national climate policies and strategies that build the capabilities  of individuals, communities, and nations. This approach can link  national level efforts to international level commitments to generate  the momentum and long-term commitment necessary to shift  economies to low-carbon pathways and achieve human well-being.   for this approach, since any attempt at creating an  international regime to combat climate change and  keep global warming within certain limits requires  ways to compare countries and the actions they take.  But this approach can also miss the ways in which  well-designed climate action affects—and can  benefit—the lives of people. Attention to capabilities  will help maintain a focus on the need to  consistently ensure climate policy itself enhances  and improves human well-being and builds toward  transformational action at a global scale.  A new narrative for equity is needed that can  help move us toward stronger climate action. By  focusing on the concrete opportunities and benefits  that climate action is able to provide, this narrative  can enable the fundamental transformation that  will improve peoples’ lives and meet the global  challenge posed by climate change.  As we move toward a world of unavoidable climate  impacts, the need for transformational climate  policy has become increasingly apparent. Shifting  economies to low-carbon pathways and building  the long-term resilience of communities are essential  challenges. Addressing these challenges in an  equitable way presents the international community  with an even greater challenge, but one that is  needed to build the necessary consensus for action.  The capabilities approach can provide a much  needed new perspective and narrative for building  equitable climate action. A focus on capabilities  enables progress to be evaluated in terms of  the concrete effects of climate policy on human  well-being. These effects can encourage proactive  approaches to policymaking that emphasize the  tangible benefits of taking action—a key factor in  mobilizing and achieving long-term transformation.  Figure 2 illustrates how the capabilities approach can  provide a pathway to support and accelerate the goal of  climate policy transformation. The figure underscores  the ways in which capabilities are relevant at multiple  levels and can build from one to the next—from individuals  and communities to nations to the globe.  The lowest level of the diagram reflects the equity  challenge currently presented by the unequal capabilities  of individuals, communities, and nations.  To address this challenge, the first level of action  focuses on the importance of committing to climate  action that also builds the capabilities of individuals  and communities. As highlighted in Chapters 2 and  3, this approach is essential to developing equitable  policy, but alone it is unlikely to move us toward  transformational goals.  The next level in the figure focuses on the broader,  more systemic aspects of capabilities at the national  level. Strengthening the capabilities of individuals  and communities can provide a foundation for  building the key capabilities of countries, which  can be enhanced through effective climate policies.  Finally, at the highest level in the figure, the capabilities  approach builds on action at the community  and national levels to generate the momentum  needed for achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient  transformation at a global scale.  Until now, the equity debate at the international  level has relied on abstract frameworks concerning  the roles played by nations. There are good reasons  .  "
WWF-2014-1.txt," Report prepared for WWF Australia Final report April 2014   2 Executive summary Over the past 50 years, increasing greenhouse gas concentrations have already had a direct effect on the Australian climate; effects which are anticipated to continue through the 21st Century. With a high degree of confidence, the IPCC (2014) has said that GHG emissions have contributed to rising average temperatures in Australia and decreasing rainfall in south-western Australia. Events such as the Black Saturday bushfires, which resulted in more than 170 deaths, have highlighted the vulnerability of some ecosystems and many human systems to climate variability. The frequency and/or intensity of such events is predicted to increase in many parts of Australia. In particular, with varying degrees of likelihood, the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, released in March 2014, identifies the following key climate change related risks faced by Australia: − increased frequency and intensity of flood damage to settlements and infrastructure; − constraints on water resources, particularly in Southern Australia, driven by rising temperatures and reduced rainfall; − increased risks to coastal infrastructure and low-lying ecosystems from continuing sea level rise; − significant reduction in agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin and far south-eastern and south-western Australia if scenarios of severe drying are realised; − increased damage to ecosystems and settlements, economic losses and risks to human life from wildfires in most of southern Australia, driven by rising temperatures and drying trends; − increased morbidity, mortality and infrastructure damages during heat waves; − significant change in community composition and structure of coral reef systems, driven by increasing sea-surface temperatures and ocean acidification; and − the loss of ecosystems in mountainous regions and some native species. Reducing these risks requires concerted international efforts. A key feature of the climate change problem is that each tonne of emissions has the same impact regardless of where it is emitted. This raises the risk that action to tackle climate change in one country (Australia) may be ineffective if the additional costs and regulation simply displace economic activity and emissions to locations which are less heavily regulated. This can result in a failure to reduce net emissions while at the same time harming Australia’s economic interests. The risk of ‘carbon leakage’ is real and needs to be taken seriously; identifying which countries are taking action and the strength of that action is important to understand the significance of this risk. At the same time, bilateral and multilateral cooperation is placing increased emphasis on what countries are doing to address climate change. The topic was a central theme in an EU-US summit in March 2014 where the two blocs agreed that sustainable economic growth is only possible if climate change is tackled (The White House 2014a). Leaders made an explicit link between trade liberalisation and efforts to address climate change. Similarly, in February 2014 a joint statement from the US and China reaffirmed their commitment to global efforts to meet the challenge. The countries agreed to achieve specific actions related to climate change in time for the Sixth US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue to be held later in 2014. This suggests that international trade partners are increasingly placing attention on what countries are doing to address climate change, and that they are linking progress on the matter to a wider range of issues   3 affecting Australia’s national interest. This further increases the importance of understanding the climate action that Australia’s key international partners are taking. This report looks at both the historic performance and future trends in climate action in a series of Australia’s key trading partners. It considers Australia’s performance relative to six countries: the US, China, Indonesia, the EU, Singapore and South Korea. The report chose these countries on the basis of an objective assessment of either their contribution to global emissions or their significance as an Australian trading partner. Historic performance of comparator countries Four factors can explain trends in emissions from energy consumption: population growth, income growth, the energy intensity of the economy and the carbon intensity of energy consumption. Of these, the two most appropriate mechanisms for policy action are to reduce the energy intensity of the economy or the carbon intensity of energy consumption. Energy intensity Carbon intensity Four of the six comparators – EU, US, Indonesia and China – reduced the energy intensity of their economy more than Australia over the period 2005-2011. While the energy intensity of Australia’s economy fell by nine per cent, other developed areas such as the US and EU achieved reductions in energy intensity of 10 and 13 per cent respectively as indicated in Figure 1. Reductions were higher again in China (16 per cent) and Indonesia (17 per cent). One specific measure of energy intensity is provided by the energy efficiency of light duty vehicles; on this metric Australia is one of the worst performers in the world. IEA (2013) analysis of the fuel   4 economy of new registrations of light duty vehicles reveals that Australia’s car fleet is the most energy intensive of the 37 countries reviewed, with each new vehicle consuming on average 9.1 litres of gasoline equivalent (lge) /100km. This is almost twice as high as the lead country, Denmark, which had a metric of 5.2 lge/100km and an EU average in the sample of 5.9 lge/100km (Figure 2). Australia also ranks behind the other comparator countries for which data is available including the US (8.2 lge/100km), South Korea (7.7 lge/100km), China (7.7 lge/100km) and Indonesia (6.5 lge/100km). Tested fuel economy figures are 2010 averages based on country samples of new registrations of light duty vehicles; *EU is average across 21 tested member states; lge denotes litres of gasoline equivalent. Vivid Economics based on IEA For carbon intensity, three of the six countries – China, the EU and Singapore – achieved greater reductions in carbon intensity than Australia over the same time period. While Australia achieved a 3.6 per cent reduction in carbon intensity of energy consumption during 2005-11, China achieved a 4.2 per cent decline and the EU a 4.0 per cent decline. At 14 per cent, Singapore achieved the greatest reduction in carbon intensity. A further metric which measures decarbonisation success is the extent of additional renewable energy capacity; Australia has added less capacity than most comparator countries. Figure 3 shows that Australia increased its renewable capacity by 32 per cent in the years 2005-11, adding 3,000 MW. In percentage terms this was the second lowest of all countries in the sample with China achieving a 153 per cent increase and the EU a 73 per cent increase. The figure also shows that in Australia, a 1 per cent increase in GDP over this period was associated with just a 1.5 per cent increase in renewables capacity; this was the fifth lowest out of the six countries analysed. In the EU and US, a 1 per cent increase in GDP was associated with a 3.2- 3.9 per cent increase in renewables capacity. Tested fuel economy, lge/100km   5 Estimates on Singapore not available due to data limitations Vivid Economics based on EIA data Taken together, Australia compares unfavourably across many metrics of the country’s recent emissions performance. Table 1 shows that against the six comparator countries, Australia: − underperforms against four out of six countries for reductions in the energy intensity of the economy between 2005 and 2011; − underperforms against all countries for which data is available on vehicle energy efficiency; − underperforms against three countries in terms of reductions in the carbon intensity of its energy consumption; and − underperforms against four out of five countries on a metric which captures the responsiveness of renewables capacity growth to GDP growth. Future emissions trends The CCA has assessed that Australia should increase its 2020 emission reduction target from five per cent to 15 per cent below 2000 levels. It finds that the 15 per cent target is the minimum required consistent with the latest science on climate change and a more equitable spread of effort over the decades ahead. The Authority also notes that the target can be achieved at manageable costs once appropriate policies are implemented. Percentage change in renewables capacity given a 1% increase in GDP, 2005-1 Lge is litres of gasoline equivalent; *Average for 21 tested member states; Fuel economy tests are 2010 light duty vehicle averages for new registrations. Vivid Economics   7 A five per cent target is weaker than many comparator countries’ targets, particularly the US and Indonesia. Table 2 indicates that many countries targets are more ambitious than Australia’s five per cent target. If all countries achieved their goals by 2020 then, using four different metrics suggested by the CCA for measuring extent of climate ambition1, Australia would: − underperform against two countries in terms of proportionate emissions reductions; − underperform against four countries in terms of emissions intensity levels; − underperform against three countries in terms of emission reductions from Business-As-Usual (BAU) and − underperform against all six countries in terms of per person emissions levels. Even if Australia maintains only a five per cent target, expected policy changes would likely see it falling far short of achieving that goal. Currently implemented policies in Australia are expected to result in the country achieving the unconditional five per cent target. However, various studies have shown that expected legislative changes, particularly to the carbon trading framework, would lead to Australia falling far short of achieving this goal. By contrast, five out of six comparator countries are on track to achieving their emission reduction targets. Error! Reference source not found. shows whether or not countries are on track to meet their targets according to a range of scenarios: − in the US, the successful implementation of the Climate Action Plan (CAP) will result in the country reaching its 17 per cent target, a goal that is more ambitious than Australia’s on all four metrics identified by the CCA; − China will also achieve its target if further planned policies are implemented. While the target is less ambitious than Australia’s on most metrics, attaining the goal will result in a reduction in emissions intensity comparable with most developed economies; − Indonesia is on track to achieve its target once further planned polices are implemented. The target is more ambitious than Australia’s for three out of four metrics; − the EU is firmly on track to meet its 2020 target with existing policies, with some projections estimating that it will exceed it. It is more ambitious than Australia’s target for two out of four metrics; and − Singapore is on track to deliver its unconditional target with existing policies. The target is more ambitious than Australia’s using two of the four metrics. Among the six comparators reviewed in this study, South Korea is the only one not on track to meet its  emission reduction target. Although South Korea will begin an emissions trading scheme in 2015, independent analysis suggests it may still fall somewhat short of its target. Nevertheless, South Korea's efforts would be more ambitious than Australia's five per cent target for three out of four metrics considered. The contrast with Australia's performance against its projected target is stark. 1 Proportionate reduction in emissions; deviation in emissions from business as usual; impact on carbon intensity of GDP; and impact on emissions per person.   8 The emissions associated with the target for each country is indexed to 100 and projections indexed accordingly. A lower figure indicates greater expected emission reduction. For the US, China, Indonesia and South Korea, projections assume implementation of policies planned but not yet implemented. For Australia, projections assume repeal of climate legislation as planned but not yet implemented. A number of countries have expressed their targets as a range. In this chart, China calculations relate to 40% emission intensity reduction target, for Indonesia 26% reduction against BAU emissions, for Singapore a 7% reduction against BAU and for Australia a 5% reduction target. Vivid Economics Current and future policies In contrast to Australia’s plans to repeal clean energy legislation, comparator countries have recently increased both their commitment and actions to tackle climate change. The leaders of the US, China, the EU, and South Korea have been vocal in recent months in their calls for greater global and domestic efforts to tackle climate change. Several countries, including the US, EU and Singapore, have also developed or renewed overarching strategy documents to achieve targets and promote sustainable energy. Recent policy developments in comparator countries point to their commitment to achieving emissions targets and promoting economic growth through green investments. Other major policy developments in comparator countries focus on: − Renewable energy – grants, incentives, official targets and reforms of regulations have been enacted in order to promote investment in renewables and increase capacity; − Energy efficiency (EE) – energy management practices for large users, EE obligations, demand side management schemes and tax incentives have been increased to improve energy efficiency; − Carbon management – Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) are increasingly being rolled out, with five regional schemes implemented in China and one in South Korea expected in 2015. Existing schemes in the US and EU are being reformed to increase effectiveness; and Projected emission ranges indexed to national target   10 − Transport and other measures – Fuel quality and economy standards have been tightened in the US and China, while new standards will be introduced in the EU from 2021. Table 3 summarises the key policy measures implemented over the past 12 months in comparator countries, as well as some expected developments.    17 1 Introduction This report reviews the climate action being undertaken in six leading economies of significance to Australia. There are at least two reasons why climate action undertaken by Australia’s key trading partners is significant: – It is often argued that action by Australia to reduce emissions risks undermining the competitiveness of key sectors of its economy because other countries are not taking comparable action. Furthermore, if other countries are not acting, then the environmental credibility of Australia’s emission reduction efforts could be damaged as there would be incentives for economic activity, and associated emissions, to relocate from Australia to other locations resulting in little or no reduction in global emissions (a phenomenon known as carbon leakage). By contrast, if other countries are taking action on climate change then the risk of damaging Australian competitiveness and its susceptibility to carbon leakage is much reduced. – Second, there is growing evidence that international discussions are linking action on climate change to a broader range of issues. For instance, climate change was a central theme in an EU-US summit in March 2014 where the two blocs agreed that sustainable economic growth is only possible if climate change is tackled (The White House 2014a). Part of the analysis looks at the historic trends in emissions in comparator countries. This compares each country’s performance with that of Australia. It looks in particular at whether these countries have been able to reduce the energy intensity of their economies and the carbon intensity of their energy consumption more or less quickly than Australia in recent years. This analysis also considers the extent of renewables growth in these countries and the energy performance of its vehicle fleet. A second part of the analysis examines the forward-looking targets, in the context of analysis which suggests that Australia is not currently on track to meet its own target, and the policies comparator countries have implemented recently to attain them. Current legislation, if fully implemented, would be sufficient for Australia to meet its unconditional five per cent target. However, if the new administration implements policy proposals, including the repeal of clean energy legislation and carbon taxes, Australia is projected to miss its own emission reduction target. Detailed modelling by the Climate Institute (2013) suggests that coalition policy would result in emissions eight to ten per cent above 2000 levels by 2020, depending on policy scenario assumptions. It is therefore pertinent to understand whether other countries are on track to meet the targets that they have set themselves. This analysis builds on earlier work by the Climate Change Authority (CCA), which compared the emission reduction ambition of Australia with its key trading partners using a variety of different metrics. It also identifies the key policies and actions that governments have undertaken or plan to introduce in order to help meet these targets. 1.1 Structure of the report The countries covered are the US, China, Indonesia, the European Union, Singapore and South Korea. We identify these countries based on an objective assessment of the economies that both:  − are most important in delivering global emission reductions; and − whose firms could stand to gain if Australia was taking emission reduction action which was not being matched in their host country. The analysis for each country follows the same structure: – First, we review the recent historic performance of the country in reducing emissions. This focuses on emissions from the energy sector, and considers whether, adjusting for population changes and GDP growth, the country has recently improved both the energy intensity of its economy and the carbon intensity of its energy use by more or less than Australia. To augment this, we also consider the fuel efficiency of the light duty fleet in each country2 as well as trends in renewable power capacity growth. – Second, we identify the emission reduction target(s) that the country has set itself, ordinarily as part of the pledges made in response to the Copenhagen Accord, and use the analysis provided by the CCA to compare the ambition of this target with Australia’s (actual and potential) targets3. We also report additional evidence on the ambition of the target where it is available. – Third, we review the latest evidence on whether or not the country is on track to meet its target(s). This synthesises both modelling undertaken within the country, either by governments or other stakeholders (e.g. academics, policy analysts) as well as analysis by international bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA). We assess whether the country: o is on track to meet its target with existing policy measures; o appears on track if additional identified policy measures are successfully implemented; or o is not on track. – Finally, we document some of the key recent and expected future climate policy actions that the country is taking covering, for instance, carbon pricing initiatives, the promotion of renewables, support to energy efficiency as well as policies in the transport and forestry sectors where applicable. 2 Data on trends over time are not available for this variable. 3 The Climate Change Authority did not consider Singapore in its analysis. In this case, we replicate the CCA analysis as far as possible.   19 2 United States 2.1 Recent historic performance The US has already achieved an 8.4 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions from energy combustion in the period 2005-2011. This reduction is significant given that CO2 emissions from energy combustion accounted for 83 per cent of the US’s emissions in 2005. It is possible to decompose these emissions into four elements. The Kaya decomposition explains trends in CO2 emissions from energy consumption according to four factors: population, GDP per capita, energy intensity and carbon intensity using the following formula: Figure 5 shows that the US: — achieved an overall decline in CO2 emissions of 8.5 per cent in the 2005 to 2011 period; — achieved a decline in energy intensity of 10.2 per cent over the period; — reduced its carbon intensity of energy production by 3.1 per cent; — had stagnant real GDP per capita meaning that output contributed to the fall in emissions by approximately 0.1 per cent; and — recorded an increase in population of 5.4 per cent which offset the other factors that had contributed to a fall in emissions. While the emissions intensity performance of Australia in recent years is comparable to the US, it underperformed for both overall emissions and energy intensity. Over the same period that the US reduced its emissions by 8.5 per cent, Australia’s emissions increased by 4.3 per cent. While part of this is explained by differences in GDP performance between the two countries, the US’s decline in energy intensity (10 per cent) was greater than Australia’s (8.5 per cent). On the other hand, Australia achieved a slightly greater decrease in the emissions intensity of its energy consumption than the US (3.6 per cent compared to 3 per cent). The stronger improvement in energy intensity in the US may be reflected in the most recent data on the energy intensity of the vehicle fleet of each country. IEA analysis of the fuel economy of new light vehicle registrations in 2010 shows the US fleet had a fuel economy of 8.2 lge/100km. Despite this being one of the worst scores, it nevertheless outperformed Australia’s 9.1 lge/100km. Australia also ranks behind the US for additional renewable capacity, both in proportional terms and relative to GDP growth. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity between 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. By contrast, the US achieved additional capacity of over 43,000 MW, a 43 per cent increase. The responsiveness of growth in renewables to growth in GDP was also higher in the US:  Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). The Kaya identity decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) 2.2 Futuretargets The United States has targeted a reduction in GHG emissions in the range of 17 per cent by 2020 compared with 2005. At the time the target was submitted, it was in line with anticipated legislation which has subsequently not been enacted, but President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, launched in June last year, has since recommitted to the figure. If Australia maintains a five per cent target by 2020, the US will outperform Australia across four different metrics of emission reduction ambition. This is highlighted in Figure 6 which shows how the US target compares with Australia’s 5 per cent and 15 per cent target on four metrics to assess ambition as used by the Climate Change Authority (2014): − proportional reduction in emission levels relative to 2005 levels; − emissions intensity levels in 2020; − proportional departure from BAU emissions; and − per person emissions in 2020. 4 The responsiveness of renewables capacity growth to GDP growth is calculated by running a bivariate regression of the log of renewable capacity in each year on the log of GDP each year. The figures should not be interpreted as elasticities due to data limitations. The calculation is repeated for each country in this analysis. In each case, the success of Australia in meeting its 5 per cent target is ‘scored’ as 100. Each of the US 17 per cent target, Australia’s 15 per cent target and Australia’s 25 per cent target are scored relative to this performance. A lower number represents greater ambition to reduce emissions. It can be seen that, on all four metrics, the US’s 17 per cent target is more ambitious than Australia’s 5 per cent target.  2.3 Projected trends The CAP is projected to enable the US to meet its target, depending on emissions from land use change. The US Sixth National Communication (NC) to the UN shows baseline projections consistent with policies implemented before September 2012 (US/DOS 2014a). Figure 7 shows that the US’s baseline emissions forecast would not lead to its target being reached in two scenarios for levels of carbon sequestration from land use change and forestry5. However, implementation of the CAP (as discussed below) is projected to lead to the US’s emissions being 10 to 21 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020, depending both on whether there is high or low take up of the additional measures under the CAP as well as on emissions from land use change. The range of potential future emissions under the CAP is shown in Figure 7 below, while Table 4 shows how the combination of assumptions on take-up of additional measures and sequestration potential6 affect whether the target will be met. 5 Baseline high sequestration (BHS) and baseline low sequestration (BLS). 6 The 6th National Communication explains that the high sequestration scenario is based on an extrapolation of recent forestland and forest carbon density accumulation trends, while the low sequestration estimates reflect possible slower accumulation of forestland and carbon density. High sequestration is an extrapolation based on recent forestland and forest carbon density accumulation rate trends, and low sequestration estimates reflect possible slower accumulation and carbon density. 2020 target indexed to Australia 5%  Projections are provided by the 6th National Communication to the UN (US/DOS 2014a). BHS (Baseline High Sequestration) and BLS (Baseline Low Sequestration) are baseline scenarios with high and low projected carbon LUCF sequestration levels. Baseline scenario is consistent with policies implemented before September 2012. CAP consistent projections are baseline scenario projections less the potential reductions in GHG emission from new policies and measures under the plan. US 6th National Communication to the UN and US 1st Biennial Report Alternative projections also suggest that the US can meet its 2020 target with the Climate Action Plan in place. Figure 8 shows the projected reduction in US GHG emissions in 2020 from both the 6th National Communication as well as additional forecasts constructed by Vivid Economics from a range of sources. These forecasts combine the IEA’s projected CO2 emissions from energy consumption in its ‘current policies’ scenario and are adjusted to take account of: − the additional emission reductions anticipated under the CAP; − forecasts for non-CO2 emissions from the US Environment Protection Agency (US EPA 2012); and − Vivid Economics own forecasts for non-energy related CO2 emissions. They suggest that GHG emissions will be between 6 and 18 per cent lower than their 2005 level, depending on the level of uptake on the additional measures and on sequestration assumptions. The lower reductions are driven by the IEA’s expectation that energy-related emissions will be higher than anticipated in the 6th National Communication. BHS and BLS scenarios refer to baseline projections with high and low carbon LUCF sequestration scenarios, respectively. AHS and ALS are Alternative High Sequestration and Alternative Low Sequestration scenarios, respectively. Additional reductions are estimated in the first US Biennial Report (US/DOS 2014b). IEA+ projections are constructed by combining energy CO2 projections from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013b), projections for non-CO2 emissions from US Environment Protection Agency estimates (US EPA 2012) and non-energy CO2 projections, which are based on a Vivid Economics econometric model. Both sets of forecasts assume GDP growth of 2.7 per cent in the period 2010 to 2020. The dashed line depicts the US 2020 emissions reduction target. Vivid Economics based on sources above Percentage change relative to 2005   24 2.4 Recent policy developments The current US administration has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to use energy and environment policy to address climate change. President Obama used the State of the Union address in February 2013 to indicate his willingness to take unilateral action if necessary: ‘[I]f Congress won’t act soon to protect future generations, I will. I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take... to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy’ (The White House 2013a). The President reiterated the commitment in 2014’s State of the Union: ‘[W]e have to act with more urgency – because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods... The shift to a cleaner energy economy won’t happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way. But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. And when our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did’ (The White House 2014b). Federal policy announcements and actions on climate change accelerated sharply over the past twelve months. The administration has launched a strategy document on climate change to guide policy while enacting Executive Orders to implement it. Other actions at a federal and state level continue to strengthen the US’s commitment to address climate change. 2.4.1 Climate Action Plan The President launched the CAP in June of last year detailing the administration’s key policy objectives. The plan is intended to protect critical sectors of the economy and prepare the country for the impacts of climate change (The White House 2013b). A key pillar of the plan focusses on cutting emissions through the promotion of energy efficiency, supporting renewables and reducing emissions from fossil fuel power plants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to impose emissions standards on power plants. Power plants have been targeted for emissions reductions given they are responsible for approximately one third of all domestic GHG emissions. The President’s June memorandum, ‘Power Sector Carbon Pollution Standards’, directed the EPA to complete standards for new and existing power plants. The EPA (2013) released the proposed standards in September: − new large natural gas-fired turbines, with a heat input rating greater than 850 MMBtu/h7, will need to meet a limit of 1,000 pounds (453.6kg) of CO2 per megawatt-hour; 7 850 MMbtu/h (million British thermal units per hour) is equal to 249.3MWh.   25 − new small natural gas-fired turbines, with a heat input rating less than or equal to 850 MMBtu/h, would need to meet a limit of 1,100 pounds (499kg) of CO2 per megawatt-hour; − new coal-fired units will also need to meet a limit of 1,100 pounds (499kg) of CO2 per megawatt- hour. They would have the option to meet a somewhat tighter limit if they choose to average emissions over multiple years, thus giving additional operational flexibility. It is expected that the standards, paired with low natural gas prices, will result in the construction of new coal-fired plant becoming uneconomic. The EPA will issue proposed standards for existing power plants in June 2014 following consultations with stakeholders. The Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments on whether GHGs should be considered air pollutants for the purposes of regulation under the 1970 amendment to the Clean Air Act. It is anticipated that similar cases could delay the implementation of standards for existing power plants. As part of the objective of expanding power generation from wind, solar and geothermal sources by 2020, the CAP sets new goals for clean energy permits. The Department of the Interior is to issue permits for 10GW of renewables on public lands by 2020, in addition to the 10GW issued since 2012. The Department of Defence is committed to deploying 3GW of renewable energy on military installations by 2025. Federal agencies are tasked with reaching 100MW of installed renewable capacity across federally subsidised housing stock by 2020 (The White House 2013b). If successful, the measures would increase renewables’ installed capacity by over eight per cent compared to current 2025 projections8. To further promote clean energy sources, the President directed federal agencies to streamline the permitting and review process for transmission projects. The plan also sets a target of 20 per cent of federal energy consumption to be provided by renewable sources. Other policy changes enacted last year have directly increased the projected production of renewable energy. Legislation enacted during the year extended a US$0.023 (A$0.03)/ kWh wind energy production tax credit (PTC) as well as a 30 per cent investment tax credit to 31st December 2013. The legislation also made eligible those projects that were under construction before this revised expiry date, as opposed to the previous requirement of being placed in service. It is not clear if the PTC will be extended once again as the subsidy has expired on five occasions and Congress has renewed it five times since it was originally enacted in 1992 (Union of Concerned Scientists 2014). These provisions were the principal drivers behind the EIA increasing its projection for the share of renewable energy production in the US in 2025 to over 11 per cent, a figure which represents a five per cent increase from its previous projection9. The plan also aims to foster a global response to climate change with several initiatives: − it commits to expanding bilateral cooperation with emerging economies, such as using the institutions of the Montreal Protocol, to reduce the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). At a US-China summit last summer, the two countries entered into an agreement to work towards this goal; − the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollution, a global coalition of 30 countries launched in February 2012, will be used to tackle methane and black carbon emissions;  − US fossil fuel tax subsidies will be phased out and the administration will work with other countries towards reducing their fiscal supports for fossil fuels; and − it re-emphasises the US’s commitment to mobilise climate finance and directly support countries’ development of low emission development strategies. 2.4.2 State based cap and trade schemes California established a cap and trade scheme in January 2013 as a key component of its objective to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The initial phase of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) applies to large electric power plants and large industrial plants accounting for about 36 per cent of the state’s emissions. From 2015, emissions from the fuel sector will also be included, extending coverage to around 85 per cent of the state’s emissions (Environmental Defense Fund 2014). The cap will be reduced by two per cent per annum until 2015 and three per cent per annum between 2015 and 2020. To minimise carbon leakage, free allowances have been allocated to electric utilities (not generators), industrial facilities and natural gas distributors. The scheme sets allowance allocation at up to 90 per cent of average emissions in each sector. The scheme started with a reserve price of US$10 (A$11.10) per annum, rising by five per cent in real terms each year to US$11.34 (A$12.58) at present. Table 5 illustrates that sale prices exceeded the reserve in each auction with a high of US$14.00 (A$15.54) reached in May 2013, a figure 30 per cent above the reserve. Carbon prices in Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)10 rose sharply in 2013 in anticipation of tighter emissions caps. In February 2014, the nine states involved in the RGGI reduced the emissions cap by 45 per cent from 165 million to 91 million tons (150 million to 83 million tonnes). Coupled with other reforms, the result is expected to generate 80-90 million tons (73-82 tonnes) of additional emission reductions by 2020 (RGGI 2013). This implies annual emissions in 2020 will be 14-20 million tons (13-18 tonnes) lower compared to previous projections. According to the EIA (2014), a surplus of allowances obtained in the early years of the scheme meant that prices remained close to the price floor of US$1.93/ton (A$1.95/tonne)11 throughout 2012. In anticipation of the tighter caps, however, prices were on average 52 per cent higher in 2013, reaching a high of US$3.21/ton (A$3.23/tonne) in May. RGGI’s (2013) analysis of the changes suggests that allowance prices will be approximately US$4/ton (A$4.03/tonne) in 2014, rising to US$10/ton (A$10.06/tonne) in 2020 as the cap is incrementally tightened. 2.4.3 Energy efficiency measures Bipartisan support for energy efficiency legislation introduced in February 2014 has raised expectations of its passage through Congress. The revised Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Bill was introduced in the Senate by a Democrat and a Republican following defeat of an earlier version late last year. Key provisions include: − the establishment of a Supply Star program in the Department of Energy (DOE) to help increase the efficiency of companies’ supply chains by identifying and promoting efficient practices; − a programme to provide rebates for the purchase and installation of motor controls or transformers which reduce energy by at least five per cent; − measures to increase the energy efficiency of federal data centres; − technical assessments for firms to identify opportunities to maximise the energy efficiency of industrial processes and prevent pollution; and − support for the adoption of building codes that meet or exceed model energy codes. In early March 2014, a similar piece of legislation – the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act – passed the House of Representatives with strong bipartisan support, securing 375 votes to 36. Sponsors of the two pieces of legislation are hopeful that a reconciled energy efficiency bill can be agreed by the two chambers at an early date, although a precise date remains unknown. The President’s Climate Action Plan promotes energy efficiency with higher standards for household appliances and action across federal agencies. New minimum efficiency standards for domestic appliances and federal buildings were established in the President’s first term of office. The plan indicates standards will be tightened further up to 2016 such that the total effect will reduce carbon emissions by three billion tonnes cumulatively by 2030. Since the announcement, higher energy efficiency standards have been introduced for 10 The nine states participating in the RGGI are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. 11 All RGGI prices reported in imperial tons and converted to metric tonnes.   28 commercial refrigerators and external power suppliers. In order to increase access to capital markets for investments in energy efficiency, a partnership with the private sector will be initiated to work towards a standardised contract to finance federal investments in energy efficiency. A range of tax incentives were extended in 2013 to support corporations to invest in energy efficiency and renewable technologies. Examples of supports include (DSIRE 2014): – the Modified Accelerated Cost-Recovery and Bonus Depreciation Scheme, which allows corporates to claim accelerated depreciation for investments in a range of renewable technologies; – the Repowering Assistance Biorefinery Program, which provides payments to biorefineries to replace fossil fuels with renewable biomass; – the Business Energy Investment Tax Credit, a corporate tax credit available for a wide range of renewable technologies; – the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit, another corporate tax credit available for a wide range of commercial and industrial applications of renewable energy technologies; – the Energy Efficient New Homes Tax Credit, a tax credit for builders of all new energy efficient homes; and – the Energy-Efficient Appliance Manufacturing Tax Credit, a tax credit available for manufacturers of high efficiency residential appliances, although this was only extended for certain appliances. However, the Residential Energy Efficiency Tax Credit, a personal tax credit for domestic energy efficiency improvements, expired at the end of 2013. Barriers to investment in energy efficiency technologies and domestic energy efficiency are being lowered with loan programmes and direct funding. In December 2013, the Department of Agriculture announced plans to provide rural electric cooperatives up to US$250 million (A$277 million) to lend to business and residential customers for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems. Loans may be used for energy audits, upgrades to heating, lighting and insulation, and conversions to more efficient or renewable energy sources (Department of Agriculture 2013). The scheme is in addition to the Rural Energy for America programme which provides grants and loan guarantees directly to agricultural producers and rural small businesses for energy efficiency and renewable energy systems. More recently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it will provide US$25 million (A$27.7 million) through the Multifamily Energy Innovation Fund. The scheme is designed to enable affordable housing providers, technology firms, academic institutions, and philanthropic organisations to test new approaches to deliver cost-effective residential energy. 2.4.4 Other federal policy developments Loan programmes to support sustainable energy technologies have expanded to include Clean Capture and Storage (CCS) and innovative gas utilisation. The programmes have enabled sponsors of clean energy technologies to access capital at favourable rates. To date, US$32 billion (A$35.5 billion) has been provided for renewables and advanced vehicle technologies. In December 2013, the Department of Energy released a solicitation for US$8 billion (A$8.8 billion) in loan guarantee authority for advanced fossil fuel projects that avoid or reduce GHG emissions (Department of Energy 2014). The solicitation seeks applications for projects that cover a range of technologies including any fossil technology that is new or  significantly improved, as compared to more established technologies in service, and reduces emissions. The aim of the project is to support innovation and unlock long-term investment in clean energy technology. Tightened fuel economy standards are paying dividends with vehicle performance reaching new highs, and further emissions standards were released in March 2014. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for passenger vehicles were issued in August 2012. The Combined Passenger Car and Light Truck GHG and CAFE Standards are 250 grams/mile (106.3km/litre) by model year 2016, a level which will fall to 199 grams/mile (84.6km/litre) by 2021. Trends in CAFE performance, when compared with the performance levels projected to be achieved by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, indicate that achieved CAFE performance has exceeded levels anticipated for the 2012 and 2013 model years (Schoettle and Sivak 2013). New EPA standards announced in March 2014 further reduce maximum permitted tailpipe and evaporative emissions. With phase-in schedules ranging from 2017 to 2025 depending on vehicle type, the Tier 3 regulations will lower the permissible sulphur content of fuels and set new fleet- average standards for non-methane organic gases, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter (US Environmental Protection Agency 2014). Last November, the President signed Executive Order 13653, ‘Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change’, which directs federal agencies to strengthen resilience to and prepare communities for the impact of climate change. The Order (The White House 2013c): − establishes a Task Force on Climate Preparedness, composed of state and community leaders, to report to the administration on how to remove barriers to climate investments; − provides for federal agencies to identify policies or programmes they have enacted to support resilience-focussed actions; − instructs agencies to share information to develop new climate preparedness tools and information; and − directs agencies to plan for climate change related risks. In March 2014, US Secretary of State John Kerry made climate change the subject of his first policy guidance for his department. The guidance committed to working through the UNFCCC to negotiate a new international climate agreement applicable to all countries by 2015 to take effect in 2020 (US Department of State 2014). It also committed to expanding multilateral and bilateral engagement on climate change, implementing the Global Climate Change Initiative, and leading by example at the domestic level. The guidance concluded: ‘We need to elevate the environment in everything we do. There’s nothing I’m more proud of than when we send one of our diplomats somewhere to really get out in the field and engage, to solve a problem, and to make something happen. I want all of you to feel empowered to think and operate that way on climate change. That’s our mission as diplomats and that’s our call to conscience as citizens of this fragile planet we inhabit. So let’s get to work’ (US Department of State 2014) 2.5 Summary In conclusion, the successful implementation of the Climate Action Plan (coupled with high carbon sequestration rates) are projected to result in the US reaching 2020 emission reduction targets that, on  a number of measures, have been judged to be more ambitious than Australia’s five per cent target. The Climate Action Plan, in particular, will look to significantly reduce emissions from coal-fired power generation by introducing limits that are expected to make the construction of new coal-fired power stations uneconomic. An array of other federal fiscal initiatives will support progress, as well as a number of initiatives at the sub-national level – notably the launch of the California cap and trade scheme plus the tightening of the RGGI scheme. This builds on recent performance in the US economy that has seen it reduce its energy intensity and grow renewables more quickly than in Australia, although it has not reduced the carbon intensity of its energy consumption as quickly as Australia.   31 3 China 3.1 Recent historic performance China’s significant emissions growth between 2005 and 2011 was mainly driven by strong GDP per capita growth; at the same time, the energy intensity and carbon intensity of energy consumption have improved. Between 2005 and 2011, China’s energy related CO2 emissions grew by 47 per cent. Decomposing this increase into the four factors previously identified shows: Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). The Kaya identity decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) Both the energy intensity of the economy and the carbon intensity of energy consumption fell more quickly in China between 2005 and 2011 than it did in Australia. The 16.3 per cent improvement in the energy intensity of China’s economy was around twice as high as Australia’s over the same period, while China’s 4.2 per cent decline in the carbon intensity of energy consumption compared with a 3.6 per cent decline in Australia. Consistent with this, tested vehicle fuel economy in China indicates that its fleet outperforms that of Australia. IEA analysis of the fuel economy of new light vehicle registrations in 2010 shows the Chinese fleet had a fuel economy of 7.7 lge/100km, a figure more than 15 per cent lower than Australia’s 9.1 lge/100km. Australia also ranks behind China for absolute and proportional additions to its renewable energy capacity. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity in the years 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. However, China achieved additional capacity of over 184,000 MW, a 153 per cent increase over its 2005 level. In 2012, half of the hydropower installed globally was in China (Davidson 2014). Renewables growth was also more responsive to GDP growth in China: every 1 per cent increase in GDP was associated with a 1.53 per cent increase in renewables capacity, against 1.49 per cent in Australia. 3.2 Future targets China has set a target for reducing its emissions intensity (carbon emissions per unit of GDP) by 40-45 per cent in 2020 compared to its 2005 level. It has also committed to increasing its share of non-fossil fuels to 11.4 per cent of total energy consumption by 2015 and a 15 per cent share for non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by 2020. The government published intermediate targets to assist it to meet these commitments in the 12th Five Year Plan (FYP). Under the plan, China committed to three climate and energy targets (CDC Climat Research 2011): – a 16 per cent reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2015 compared to 2010; – a 17 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 2015; and – a 21.7 per cent forest coverage rate and an increase in wood stock of 600 million m3 by 2015. If Australia maintains a five per cent target by 2020, it will outperform China in three out of four metrics developed by the CCA for measuring the extent of ambition across countries. This is shown in Figure 10 below using the same approach as before: Australia’s performance under its five per cent target is scored at 100 for each metric with more ambitious climate action resulting in a lower index number. However, other analysis suggests that China’s pledge broadly matches those made by many advanced economies. According to Jotzo (2010): ‘China’s target of cutting emissions intensity by 40 to 45 per cent over 15 years is very similar to the reductions in emissions intensity implicit in the targets by the large developed countries.’ This reflects the change in the emissions intensity in China’s target (rather than the absolute level of emissions intensity that it leads to). On this basis, Jotzo (2010) argues that it represents a degree of de- carbonisation of economic activity which is commensurate with developed economies and that the Chinese  emissions intensity target ‘could become a model for other developing countries that wish to define their targets more concretely.’ Lower value indicative of greater ambition for a given metric. China projection is for 40% emissions intensity reduction. Assumption of a 45% reduction yields similar results except for target relative to BAU where ambition would exceed Australia’s 5% target Vivid Economics based on CCA 3.3 Projected trends China projects that it will reach the 40 to 45 per cent reduction in emissions intensity compared to 2005 if it successfully implements additional (planned) policies. China’s Second National Communication to the UN (China/NDRC 2012) defines an enhanced policy scenario for the evolution of energy combustion emissions, which takes account of policies and measures taken in its 11th FYP period (2006-2010) as well as further policies and measures planned for the 12th and 13th FYP spanning the decade to 2020. We augment these with non-CO2 forecasts from US Environment Protection Agency (US EPA 2012) and CO2 emissions from industrial processes from our own modelling. The resulting forecasts suggest that emissions intensity will fall by 45 per cent in 2020 compared to 2005. Using the National Communication’s forecasts for energy-related emissions assuming no new policies and measures beyond those implemented in the 11th FYP indicate that emissions intensity will be 37 per cent lower in 2020 than in 2005. Forecasts based on IEA projections for emissions suggest a similar outcome. The IEA provides an independent and comparable set of projections of China’s energy carbon emissions. Combining these with the other sources as discussed above suggests that China’s emissions intensity will be 43 to 46 per cent lower 2020 target indexed to Australia 5%   in 2020 than in 2005, depending on whether only current policies or new policies are implemented by 2020. The combination of forecasts is shown in Figure 11. In the NC projections, energy related CO2 emissions are sourced from the Second National Communication .It assumes a GDP growth of 7 per cent for the 2011-2020 period (National Development and Reform Commission 2012). IEA projections are based on the 2013 World Energy Outlook (OECD/IEA 2013b), which assumes a GDP growth of 8 per cent. Projections for non-CO2 emissions are based on US Environment Protection Agency estimates (US EPA 2012). Non-energy CO2 projections are based on Vivid Economics econometric model. Finally, emissions due to LUCF are assumed to be stable over the forecast horizon. Vivid Economics using sources above China is increasingly using market-based instruments to achieve GHG reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy investment targets. Environmental and climate issues are increasingly towards the top of the political agenda. Common to many major economies, although there is not yet a comprehensive climate change law in China, legislation is expected to be published in 2014 with passage likely by 2015 following consultation with ministries and other stakeholders (Nachmany et al. 2014). In addition to efficiency and emissions targets being tightened in recent FYPs, further developments include the introduction of regional cap and trade schemes, continued investment in renewables and policies to incentivise energy efficiency. Such measures have been among the driving forces behind predictions that the country will see a flattening or peaking of coal demand by 2020 or even earlier. Current and future Chinese coal consumption patterns have changed due to drives to reduce air pollution, structural shifts in the economy and energy intensity, growth in renewables, gas and nuclear capacity and efficiency improvements in power Percentage change relative to 2005    plants and energy demand (Citi Research 2013). Taken together, this has resulted in some predictions that peak coal demand could be reached as early as 2015. 3.4.1 ETS and carbon pricing Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong, was the first of seven regional cap-and-trade schemes to become operational in June 2013. The city commenced emissions trading in June 2013, with 635 companies accounting for 26 per cent of GDP taking part (Financial Times 2013). The firms emitted 30m tonnes of CO2 last year, 38 per cent of Shenzhen’s total emissions. Participants are set to reduce their carbon intensity by almost seven per cent between 2013 and 2015. By December, the exchange had reached a trading volume of 144,600 tonnes at a representative price of RMB83 (A$14.99). Table 6. Almost 1,700 enterprises are participating in five ETS schemes in China Emissions Shanghai has a separate emissions threshold for non-industrial sectors of 10,000 tonnes CO2. Vivid Economics based on ICAP Four more cities or regions have since launched markets with a total of seven to be in place by the end of 2014. Collectively the pilots form the largest carbon market outside Europe. In November, emissions exchanges opened in Beijing and Shanghai with initial carbon prices trading at RMB51/tonne (A$9.21) and RMB27/tonne (A$4.88) respectively (Climate Bridge 2014) before falling back slightly in January as indicated in Figure 7. Guangdong opened trading in December when permits sold at a high of RMB61/tonne (A$11.02) while Tianjin’s first auction saw carbon trade at RMB28/tonne (A$5.06) (Bloomberg 2013a). These figures are lower than the fixed price of Australia’s current fixed price under its carbon pricing mechanism of A$24.15. Other regions are experimenting with similar schemes: − Hangzhou in Zhejiang province started trading energy consumption permits last year; and − Shenyang in northern Liaoning has launched a voluntary market for CO2 allowances (Reuters 2014a).   36 Lessons from these pilots will be instrumental in developing any national ETS regime, set to be in place by the end of the decade. The regional cap and trade schemes are seen as a learning exercise for the development of a national cap and trade scheme that may be introduced by 2020. Analysis of the pilots (WRI 2014) notes that they have successfully designed essential building blocks such as: − determining how the ETS would apply to various greenhouse gas types, sectors, emissions sizes, and accounting boundaries; − choosing how emissions allowances will be allocated; − establishing the size of cap and reduction trajectories; and − the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions. In March 2013, under the auspices of the World Banks’s Partnership for Market Readiness initiative, a programme of work to prepare for a national emissions trading scheme was launched, including issues such as coverage identification, the necessary technical and institutional requirements for an ETS and studies on a wide range of ETS design issues such as allowance allocation, MRV, price containment mechanisms, offset mechanism and market oversight (PMR Partnership Assembly 2013). A survey of individuals working in research, industry and carbon trading institutions indicates clear expectations that China will meet its commitment to establish a national ETS. Half of the respondents expect a national ETS to be in place at or before 2018, rising to over 80 per cent who believe it will exist by 2020 (Jotzo, Kater, and de Boer 2013). Just one per cent of respondents expect that China will never adopt a national ETS. Price expectations meanwhile vary greatly between experts, suggesting that there is uncertainty about the nature and stringency of ETS and the response of the economy. They rise sharply from RMB29/tonne (A$5.24) in 2018 to RMB51/tonne (A$9.21) in 2020 and steadily to RMB68/tonne (A$12.28) in 2025. Expert opinion suggests that a carbon tax will be established in conjunction with the national ETS. Recent reports suggest that officials will examine the impact of the regional ETS pilots and international experience to inform their decision on whether to proceed with a national carbon tax (Bloomberg 2013b). Expert opinion suggests that China will follow through on commitments to implement a carbon tax in addition to any plans for a national ETS, with almost 70 per cent of those surveyed saying it will be in place by 2020 (Jotzo, Kater, and de Boer 2013). Only 15 per cent of surveyed experts said they expect China will never adopt a carbon tax. Expected carbon tax levels rise from RMB7 tonne (A$1.26) in 2016 to RMB32/tonne (A$5.78) in 2025. However, the expected repeal of the Australian carbon tax has been cited by Chinese authorities as a reason to slow its efforts to tackle emissions. Recent comments by China’s vice-minister for finance, Zhu Guangyao, suggest that the country may be seeking to slow the implementation of a nationwide carbon tax due to concerns it would pose a costly burden to large companies (The Sydney Morning Herald 2014). While he is still in favour of fiscal measures to reduce emissions and a carbon tax remains under consideration as part of tax reforms in , the minister cited Australia’s attempts to abolish the carbon tax as a possible justification for the slowdown.   37 3.4.2 Renewable energy New incentives for the photovoltaic (PV) industry are intended to support ambitious plans for solar deployment announced in the 12th FYP for Solar Power Development (2011-2015). Released in September 2012, the strategy establishes a target of 21GW of installed solar capacity by 2015 with total capacity to reach 50GW by 2020. Solar deployment progress has been impressive with capacity rising to 7GW in 2012, more than double the 3GW capacity in 2011. To further support its development, in June 2013 the State Council put forward measures to promote the development of the PV industry. The regulations specify that expanding distributed PV applications should be prioritised, grid companies should purchase full amounts of PV power generation and that PV electricity price support policy should be improved (The Climate Group 2014). Pricing policy was reformed in September giving PV units a RMB0.42 (A$0.08) subsidy for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced, replacing project-investment based subsidies. Recently, the Chinese government further increased targets for solar capacity to 35GW by 2015, 70GW by 2017, and a target of 100GW is under discussion (China Finance 2014). The government is expected to announce reforms of energy management systems to promote greater use of wind power. China added 14GW of grid-connected wind capacity in 2013, making it the fifth consecutive year of capacity additions of greater than 10GW. However, wind farms were unable to generate 21.8 billion kWh of electricity in 2012 and 9.6 billion kWh in the first three quarters of 2013 due to wind curtailment12 (Pengfei 2013). To address the issue, in October 2013 the National Energy Bureau announced its intention to reform energy management systems including granting wind power priority access to the grid and a quota system for power generation from renewable sources (Wind Power Monthly 2013). New targets for wind capacity were also recently increased, with capacity to reach 100GW in 2015 and 150GW in 2017 (China Finance 2014). Current investment in renewables is expected to result in significant changes to China’s energy mix by 2040. As indicated in Figure 12, the EIA anticipates that the share of coal in the country’s installed electricity capacity is expected to fall from two thirds today to a little over half in 2040. Meanwhile, wind power will see a sharp increase rising from five to 12 per cent to become the country’s third largest energy source. Solar and other renewables will also account for a significantly larger share of capacity rising from about 0.2 per cent to over five per cent. Taken together, by 2040 renewables will account for 35 per cent of China’s installed electricity mix. 12 Also known as spilled wind, this occurs when grid operators tell wind farm operators to reduce output because of reliability elsewhere in the grid or other constraints.   3.4.3 Energy efficiency measures Deductions, grants and allowances to promote energy efficient capital investment and renewable power are already well established in China. These include: − accelerated depreciation for domestic enterprises that purchase listed renewable energy equipment; − investments in special equipment for energy conservation may qualify for a 10 per cent tax credit; − a custom duty and VAT exception is in place for certain imported energy efficient equipment; and − a three year corporate tax exemption and a three year 50 per cent tax reduction on derived income is available for renewable power projects. A number of specific policy measures were announced in 2013 to promote energy efficiency in buildings and increase resource conservation. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Housing, and Urban-Rural Development (MHURD) implemented the Green Building Action Plan which introduces green building standards. By the end of 2015, 20 per cent of new urban constructions are expected to meet green building standards. In October 2013, the State Council issued guidance on resolving excess capacity in key industries suggesting that resource efficiency will be improved by eliminating out-dated production capacity. In November, the State Council issued the National Plan for Sustainable Development of Resource-based Cities in China (2013-2020) as a strategy to reform resource- based cities including measures to promote energy conservation and emission reduction (The Climate Group 2014). Linked to this, a range of financial incentives are in place to promote energy efficient building construction. Subsidies were introduced in 2012 for both the construction of new energy efficient buildings and the retrofitting of existing buildings. Grants of up to RMB50 million (A$9 million) are available for the construction of green buildings in designated green ecological city zones. Proportion of installed electricity capacity   39 Fuel quality standards were further tightened throughout 2013 as part of a policy to achieve emissions targets and improve air quality in cities. Regulatory agencies issued new standards over the course of the year following a directive by the State Council in February calling for cleaner fuels. The China V diesel and gasoline standards were issued in June and December respectively, and will be phased in by December 2017 (The International Council on Clean Transportation 2014). Price rises for higher quality fuels were announced by the National Development and Reform Commission to incentivise refineries to meet the fuel quality improvement targets. 3.5 Summary Projections suggest that China is on track to meet its target of a 40-45 per cent reduction in emissions intensity by 2020. This is a target that will deliver a reduction in emissions intensity that is comparable to the ambition in many developed country targets, although on other metrics the CCA analysis suggests that the target is less ambitious than Australia’s (with the notable exception of per capita emissions). China has already been able to reduce the carbon intensity of its energy consumption and energy intensity of its economy more quickly than Australia in the recent past and the introduction of a series of ETS pilots, expected to be the prelude to a national ETS, makes further strong performance likely.   40 4 Indonesia 4.1 Recent historic performance Emissions from energy use in Indonesia grew by 27 per cent from 2005 to 2011 due to strong economic growth, although energy intensity has been steadily declining. The heavy dominance of land-use change emissions in Indonesia13, for which a decomposition analysis is not possible, means that the decomposition analysis is less significant in explaining recent emissions trends. Nonetheless, as shown in Figure 13: — GDP per population has increased by 32 per cent, which is the main driver of high CO2 emissions; — energy intensity fell by 17 percent; — carbon intensity has increased by 9 per cent; and — population growth had a moderate impact on emissions. Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). Kaya identity, decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) Indonesia has reduced the energy intensity of its economy much more quickly than Australia in recent years, potentially reflecting its low starting point. However, while Australia’s carbon intensity of energy consumption has fallen, Indonesia’s has grown. Indonesia’s energy intensity reductions are almost 13 Accounting for around 30 per cent of emissions in 2010 (World Resources Institute 2012). Index (2005=100)   41 twice as great as Australia’s over the period. Yet while Indonesia’s carbon intensity of energy consumption has increased, Australia has achieved a modest reduction in recent years. Consistent with the improvements in energy efficiency achieved by Indonesia, vehicle fuel economy in Indonesia is significantly better than in Australia. IEA analysis of the fuel economy of new light vehicle registrations in 2010 shows the Indonesian fleet had a fuel economy of 6.5 lge/100km, a figure almost 30 per cent lower than Australia’s 9.1 lge/100km. By contrast, Australia outperforms Indonesia for additions to renewable energy capacity. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity in the years 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. In the same time frame, Indonesia achieved additional capacity of over 900 MW, a 17 per cent increase over its 2005 level. Similarly, renewables growth was less responsive to GDP growth: every 1 per cent increase in GDP in Indonesia was associated with an increase in renewables capacity of 0.46 per cent against 1.49 per cent in Australia. Indonesia has pledged to reduce its emissions by 26 per cent relative to BAU in 2020, and up to 41 per cent with international assistance. This implies that emissions need to be reduced relative to the baseline by around three percentage points per annum. 4.3 Projected trends Indonesia’s Second National Communication to the UN (SNC 2010) puts the country on track to meet its 2020 target of 26 per cent reduction in emissions relative to BAU. This identifies two abatement scenarios, differing according to the cost of implementing mitigation measures and the extent of international cooperation and funding, which project emissions to be 29 per cent and 46 per cent lower compared to BAU in 2020, as indicated in Figure 15. The outcome of the two scenarios will depend on the cost of implementing the mitigation. Under the conservative scenario, most of the reduction occurs to GHG emissions from peat, accounting for 53 per cent of total reductions, compared to 21 per cent from energy. NC Scenarios 1 and 2 are the abatement scenarios from the 2nd National Communication. IEO refers to forecasts of emissions for energy combustion from the Indonesia Energy Outlook and forecasts of other greenhouse gases from other NC scenario 1. Vivid Economics using sources above Further analysis highlights the importance of controlling coal consumption to meet the target. The Indonesian government’s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology published two further scenarios for energy demand in Indonesia (BPPT 2012). While one of these scenarios confirms that the 26 per cent reduction target can be met, the more ambitious Master Plan for Accelerating and Expansion of Indonesia’s Economic Development (MP3EI) scenario projects significantly greater use of coal to meet Percentage change relative to 2005   43 Indonesian energy demand in 2020, which it suggests would result in Indonesia missing its emissions target by 4 percentage points14. Indonesia is the largest energy consumer in Southeast Asia, accounting for 36 per cent of the region’s total primary consumption in 2011 (International Energy Agency 2013). In order to achieve emissions reductions and renewables targets, recent policy focusses on: − reducing deforestation and land use emissions; − expanding renewables’ grid access; − promoting energy efficiency; and − reforming energy subsidies and other transport measures. 4.4.1 Reducing deforestation and land use emissions Following significant delays, the government approved the establishment of a new REDD15 agency in September 2013. In 2010, Norway pledged US$1 billion (A$1.11 billion) to support REDD activities in Indonesia as almost 80 per cent of the country’s GHG emissions stem from deforestation and land use change (Embassy of Norway 2010). A task force established by the government piloted projects and started the process of mapping land ownership. However, the slow progress in transitioning the task force to a REDD agency meant that Norway disbursed just 4 per cent of funding by the end of 2013 (Perera 2014). The government has tasked the new agency with formulating forest management policies that will slow Indonesia’s rate of deforestation and to draft and implement plans for a national REDD strategy. It is also expected that the agency will extend a moratorium, due to expire in 2015, on clearing new land for commercial use. The agency will also focus on completing pilot projects in Rimba Raya, the world’s largest REDD project, which was approved in Indonesia in 2013. The government approved the 64,000-hectare forest carbon project on Borneo in May. The Verified Carbon Standard, a certification standard for carbon credits, subsequently verified the project. It is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 119 million tonnes over its 30 year lifespan (The Guardian 2013). The emissions reductions will come from avoiding drainage of area’s carbon dense peatlands and a fall in the conversion of forests to oil palm plantations. 4.4.2 Expanding renewables In January 2014, parliament endorsed an official target of 23 per cent of energy to come from renewable sources by 2025, rising to 31 per cent by 2050. Indonesia had previously set a 15 per cent renewables target. Figure 16 illustrates that the new energy policy have set a number of additional targets for the supply and use of energy: 14 Energy related emissions forecasts were combined with scenario 1 from the SNC for other GHG emissions forecast to obtain the forecast of total emissions. 15 Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) is a UN programme.  − the proportion of fossil fuels, other than natural gas, in the energy mix will be more than halved from approximately 49 per cent to less than 20 per cent in 2050; − natural gas will rise slightly from 20 per cent to 24 per cent in 2050; and − renewables will rise from the current level of just over five per cent to become the most important source of energy in 2050, accounting for over 30 per cent of supply. Fossil fuels refers to coal and peat but excludes natural gas. Vivid Economics based on Indonesia Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Despite agreement on feed-in tariffs for geothermal generation in 2012, regulatory issues continue to obstruct the technology’s expansion. The country has almost 4,100 MW of geothermal potential in the pipeline for development, making it the world’s number one source of geothermal development. If all plants under construction are finished by their publicly announced completion dates, Indonesia could reach almost 2 GW of installed capacity by 2018 (Geothermal Energy Association 2013). In 2012, the government agreed geographically based feed-in-tariffs of between US$0.1/kWh and US$0.17/kWh (A$0.11/kWh and A$0.19/kWh) to assist in the roll-out of geothermal projects. This replaced a previous tendering process coupled with a nationwide cap on tariffs of just under US$0.1/kWh (A$0.11) (Baker and McKenzie 2012). However, an objective to add an additional 4GW of capacity by 2014 through tariff reform and ‘fast track planning’ has been missed. Indonesia still struggles with regulatory issues obstructing geothermal development – land acquisition and permit issues have stalled 30 projects, many of which were proposed over a decade ago (Eco-business 2013). Recent reforms of solar photovoltaic regulations are also intended to boost output and provide certainty to investors. In June 2013, the government passed Regulation 17 which obliges the state power company (PLN) to purchase electricity generated by photovoltaic power plants based on a capacity quota offered through public auction. The business that wins the auction signs a purchase agreement with PLN at a Proportion in energy mix   45 pre-determined price of US$0.25 (A$0.28) per kilowatt hour or US$0.30 (A$0.33) per kilowatt hour if local components in the plant amount to 40 per cent (Schlueter 2013). Fixed pricing replaces the previous case-by- case negotiation framework and is intended to give certainty to solar producers and foreign investors. Auction winners must begin development of power generation facilities within three months of agreeing the power purchase arrangement with PLN and securing financial backing. 4.4.3 Promoting energy efficiency Government regulations, incentives and penalties are intended to promote energy efficiency in industrial sectors, although gaps remain in implementation. A 2009 regulation on energy conservation mandated authorities to implement a comprehensive energy efficiency strategy. As part of this, it requires companies with energy consumption above 6,000 tonnes of oil equivalent (ToE) to: − appoint energy managers and design energy conservation programmes; − conduct regular audits, to be performed by a certified auditor (either internal or external); − implement the recommendation of the audit process according to cost effectiveness within one to five years, depending on costs and investment viability; and − report on the energy conservation implementation. However, several aspects of the 2009 regulation remain to be enacted. Tax breaks have not been implemented as envisaged. Credit lines at low interest rates to banks and local governments for energy efficient investments have not yet been established and guidelines have not been published. Other demand side measures focus on domestic energy efficiency with labelling schemes and minimum standards expected to be expanded in 2014. The energy ministry (MEMR) introduced a labelling scheme – ‘More Stars, More Efficient’ – for CFLs in 2011, which they intend to expand to include other products (MEMR 2013). The MEMR has more recently indicated it intends to introduce minimum efficiency performance standards for appliances, possibly commencing with air conditioning units in 2014. Energy efficiency in the public sector is targeted with a regulation mandating government institutions to achieve verified energy savings. From July 2012, all government buildings, state-owned buildings, official residents as well as street-lighting, decorative lighting and billboards were mandated to achieve 20 per cent electricity savings and 10 per cent gasoline savings relative to 2011. In the first quarter of implementation, 71 out of 76 agencies had reduced electricity usage by an average of 8.1 per cent. 4.4.4 Reforming energy subsidies and transport measures Electricity and fuel subsidies remain significant despite recent efforts to reduce and reform them. The Ministry of Finance (2013) projects that energy subsidies will amount to Rp282 trillion (A$27 billion) in 2014, about three per cent of GDP. However, the government has recently taken significant steps to reduce the fiscal burden of subsidies: − in June 2013, they increased subsidised energy prices for gasoline and diesel by 44 per cent and 22 per cent respectively; − based on quarterly increases, electricity tariffs were expected to rise by 15 per cent in 2013, although consumers with the lowest level of consumption have not been affected; and   46 − the energy ministry implemented a gas conversion programme to promote the development of natural gas infrastructures and the distribution of free gas converter kits for public transportation. In addition to subsidy reforms, there are some tax incentives for fuel efficient vehicles. A 2013 regulation introduced a new classification of vehicle in Indonesia called, the ‘low-cost green car’ (LCGC), and levied progressively lower sales tax on vehicles with smaller engines. The change in taxes is intended to promote demand for LCGCs (GSI 2013). In addition, government cars and vehicles used in mining and plantation operations have been banned from buying subsidised fuel in order to further promote more efficient fuel usage. 4.5 Summary Although there are some data challenges, Indonesia appears on track to be meeting an emissions reduction target that, on the three of the four indicators identified by the CCA, is more ambitious than Australia’s 5 per cent reduction target. This is being driven by efforts to reduce emissions from land-use change and peat bogs, ambitious plans for renewable deployment and a slowly increasing focus on energy efficiency (including politically challenging efforts to reduce fossil fuel subsidies). Some concerns remain over the extent to which implementation challenges may constrain the ability of Indonesia to meet the challenges it has set itself.   47 5 European Union 5.1 Recent historic performance CO2 emissions from energy use in EU have declined by 11 per cent in the period 2005 to 2011, driven largely by reductions in the energy intensity of GDP. Figure 17 depicts the outcome of the Kaya decomposition showing: — a declining energy intensity of 13 per cent; — a declining carbon intensity of 4 per cent; — a low GDP per capita growth contributing a mere 4.3 per cent to GHG emissions growth; and — a modest population growth of 2.3 per cent. : Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). Kaya identity, decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) The EU has achieved greater declines in both energy intensity of GDP and carbon intensity of energy consumption than Australia in recent years. The EU’s 13 per cent decline in energy intensity compares with a more modest 8.5 per cent in Australia, while the EU’s 4 per cent decline in carbon intensity of energy production is slightly greater than the 3.6 per cent achieved by Australia. Tested vehicle fuel economy in the EU indicates that its fleet outperforms that of Australia. An IEA analysis of the fuel economy of new light vehicle registrations in 2010 shows that the EU’s fleet had a fuel economy of 5.9 lge/100km16. This figure strongly surpassed Australia’s 9.1 lge/100km, with one EU country, Denmark, achieving the best fuel economy, 5.2 lge/100km, of all countries surveyed. Australia also ranks behind the EU for additional renewable capacity, both in absolute terms and in terms of responsiveness to GDP growth. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity in the years 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. However, the EU achieved additional capacity of over 119,000 MW, a 73 per cent increase over its 2005 level. Accounting for Australia’s strong economic performance over this time frame shows its growth in renewables capacity was relatively less responsive to GDP growth than in the EU. Every 1 per cent increase in GDP growth in Australia was associated with just 1.49 per cent increase in renewables capacity against 3.2 per cent in the EU. The Climate and Energy package constitutes the central policy to reduce GHG emissions in the EU. It includes the following near-term targets: − to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020 based on 1990 emissions; − for renewables to constitute 20 per cent of energy sources by 2020; and − a 20 per cent reduction in total primary energy consumption by 2020, compared to a business as usual baseline. If Australia maintains a five per cent target by 2020, the EU will outperform it for two of the four metrics used by the CCA for measuring the extent of ambition across countries. Figure 18 indicates that the EU will outperform Australia for per person emission levels and emission intensity levels. 16 Average based on results from 21 member states.  Lower figure indicative of greater ambition for a given metric. EU target is for a 20% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020. Vivid Economics based on CCA 5.3 Projected trends In its latest reference scenario, the European Commission projects EU emissions to be 24 per cent lower than their 1990 level (EC 2013). The updated EC reference scenario is consistent with policies adopted before spring 2012, as well as new policies and measures that will be implemented in the future, and which are aimed to meet binding targets set out in EU legislation. Analysis which aggregates the modelling results of individual member states confirms this result. Figure 19 shows both the EC projections and member states projections of GHG emissions17. The member states projections confirm that the EU is on course to meet its 2020 emissions target, even if new policies and measures were not fully adopted. Member state projections indicate that emissions will be 20 to 24 per cent lower, depending on which future measures are adopted. Combining IEA analysis for energy related emissions with data from other sources also show that EU GHG emissions to be 21 per cent to 23 per cent lower than their 1990 levels depending on whether new policies are adopted until 2020. These scenarios combine projections of energy related CO2 emissions from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013b), projections of non CO2 emissions from US EPA (US EPA 2012), while emissions from other sources are assumed to remain stable over the forecast horizon. These scenarios do not include emissions from international aviation. 17 Both targets and progress towards targets include international aviation emissions. 2020 target indexed to Australia 5%  EC reference scenario is from the EC own projection using the PRIMES model (EC 2013). Member states projections are from the European Environment Agency (EEA 2013). These scenarios include emissions from international aviation. IEA projections are adopted from IEA world energy outlook (OECD/IEA 2013b) for fuel related CO2 emissions, forecasts for other anthropogenic gases are from the US Energy Protection Agency (US EPA 2012). Finally non fuel related CO2 emissions are assumed stable over the forecast horizon. IEA scenarios do not include emissions from international aviation. Vivid Economics using sources above EU actions on climate change have been characterised by co-operation with the international community and leadership in terms of targets and mechanisms to attain targets. Recent EU policy efforts include: − reforms of the ETS to improve effectiveness; − proposals on renewable energy targets and guidelines for member states on best practice; − new energy efficiency obligations; and − reform of other policies to support the climate change agenda. 5.4.1 ETS reform and backloading The economic downturn had led to significant falls in the EU ETS carbon price. Early years of the scheme saw prices hit €32 (A$48.55) per tonne. However the economic collapse of 2008 paired with a glut  in allowances had resulted in prices falling to as low as €2.81 (A$4.26) per tonne in early 2013 and a structural surplus of around 2 billion allowances. As a result, European authorities have agreed to implement ‘backloading’ as a short-term measure to reduce the surplus of allowances leading to a sharp rise in carbon prices. The EC first proposed postponing the auctioning of allowances in 2011. The measure, known as ‘backloading’ involves redistributing 900 million allowances during Phase III of the EU ETS in order to rebalance supply and demand at present (European Commission 2014a). In December 2013, the European Parliament and European Council cleared the way for adoption of the measure, and the Climate Change Committee gave approval in January. In anticipation of the plan being agreed, carbon prices rose 62 per cent in the early weeks of 2014 to reach €6.31 (A$9.57) towards the end of February (Reuters 2014b). The EC enacted the amendment at the end of February 2014, with the aim of withdrawing almost 400 million permits this year. The Commission has proposed longer term measures to automatically address the potential for further surpluses during phase four (2021-2028) of the scheme. In January 2014 the Commission proposed the establishment of a ‘market stability reserve’ to commence in 2021 (European Commission 2014a). Allowances would be placed in and released from the reserve according to market conditions, thus automatically adjusting supply to increase market stability. It would operate according to pre-defined rules leaving no discretion to the Commission or member states in its implementation. The proposal requires approval by the Council and the European Parliament in order to become law. The likelihood of the Commission’s plans becoming law increased in March 2014 when 13 environment ministers, from states including France, Germany, Italy and the UK, issued a joint statement supporting the targets and calling for an early agreement across the region in order to remove uncertainty and promote investment (Energy Live News 2014). The Commission has also proposed to raise the annual emissions reductions factor to 2.2 per cent each year from 2021, compared with the current rate of 1.74 per cent (European Commission 2014a). 5.4.2 Renewable energy support policies In January 2014, the EC proposed an EU-wide binding target for renewables to represent at least 27 per cent of energy sources by 2030. The Commission included the target in a new framework on climate and energy for 2030. In contrast to the current 20 per cent renewables target by 2020, the proposals as drafted will not translate the new goal into national binding targets. The Commission claims that this is intended to give member states flexibility in changing their energy mix in a way that is adapted to national preferences and circumstances. It has said it will attain the EU-wide renewables target by a new governance system based on national energy plans (European Commission 2014b). However, the absence of national targets means that it is not clear how this will facilitate the EU-wide goal. The European Parliament has indicated its opposition to removing the national targets, and agreement must be reached between it, the Commission and member states before a final proposal can be agreed this year (Euractiv 2014). The EC published an update on member states’ progress and compliance with implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive in 2013. The Directive mandates the Commission to issue biennial progress reports (European Commission 2013a) with the most recent showing that: − the EU as a whole is on its trajectory towards the 2020 targets with a renewable energy share of 12.7 per cent;   52 − while a majority of Member States had reached their  interim targets by 2010, efforts will need to be increased to hit their 2020 targets given investment lead times of eight to ten years and ongoing administrative barriers; and − compliance with the Directive is varied. The Commission has initiated infringement cases against 12 countries where it has not been fully transposed. As member states begin to reform support schemes for renewables, the Commission has issued recommendations on best practice to guide future policy. A November communication (European Commission 2013b) proposes several mechanisms which member states could implement in order to support renewables while continuing to comply with state aid rules: − auctions/tenders: Member states could auction a certain capacity of renewable energy production to the lowest bidder to foster competition among producers and reward the most cost-effective; − feed-in premiums: Renewable energy producers could be paid a market price plus a premium. While the system still ensures investors receive a reasonable and safe return it also exposes them to market signals; − quota obligations: Energy suppliers have to ensure that a certain share of the electricity they supply comes from renewable or green certificates; − investment aid: Upfront support helps avoid the production of excess energy supply; and − co-operation mechanisms: To ensure that renewable energy plants are built in locations where the electricity production is the cheapest, support schemes should be opened up across borders through such mechanisms. While the communication is not a legally binding act, these principles will apply when the Commission is assessing state interventions relating to renewable support schemes or capacity mechanisms. They will also guide the future enforcement of EU state aid rules and future proposals for EU energy legislation. 5.4.3 Energy efficiency obligations Member states are obliged to implement a range of energy efficiency obligations in mid-2014 according to recently enacted legislation. Measures in the Energy Efficiency Directive (European Commission 2013c) include: − member states must set an indicative national energy efficiency target; − they must achieve a certain amount of final energy savings over the obligation period, 2014 to 2020, through targeted policy measures in the domestic, industrial and transport sectors; − large enterprises will be obliged to carry out an energy audit at least every four years, with a first energy audit to be completed by December 2015. Member states should establish incentives for SMEs to undergo audits to help them identify the potential for reduced energy consumption; − long-term strategies for building renovation should be published by the end of April 2014. Commencing January of this year, three per cent of buildings owned and occupied by central governments should be renovated each year to the level the member state has set under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive; and − national assessments for co-generation and district heating potential must be developed by the end of 2015, and strategies to implement them must be identified.   53 In addition, tighter vehicle fuel efficiency targets are set to be introduced from 2021 following endorsement by the European Parliament in February 2014. An emissions target of 95g CO2/km for new vehicles was first introduced by the EC in 2012. The initial proposals intended for a 2020 implementation date, but an intervention by the German government in mid-2013 resulted in a delay in its proposed introduction with the measures now set to be implemented in 2021 (BBC 2013). The target is averaged across the whole of the car fleet so those emitting more than the level agreed must be compensated for elsewhere. This proposal would reduce new cars’ CO2 emissions by 27 per cent compared to the 2015 target of 130g/km (EC NC). 5.4.4 Other measures Reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for the budget period of 2014‐2020 make climate mitigation and adaptation explicit objectives of the policy. The CAP accounts for about 30 per cent of the overall EU budget for the next budget period. The new measures increase carbon sinks by encouraging more grassland and the protection of forest cover. The revised policy also makes direct payments to farmers conditional upon compliance with green measures, including crop diversification, and the maintenance of permanent grassland (Nachmany et al. 2014). Other changes to the CAP include direct funding to agri‐ environmental measures and projects related to environmentally friendly investment or innovation. 5.5 Summary A range of forecasts suggest that the EU is firmly on track to meet its 2020 targets. Some projections suggest that it will appreciably exceed those targets. This is consistent with the recent emissions trends which have seen the EU economy reduce both the energy intensity of its economy and the carbon intensity of its energy consumption more aggressively than in Australia, while growing renewable capacity more quickly. The EU also has some of the best vehicle efficiency in the world. Steps are now under way to prepare for more ambitious emissions reductions in the medium-term, both through making short-term adjustments to the EU ETS to increase prices and in the form of discussions over what targets the region should adopt beyond 2020.   54 6 Singapore 6.1 Recent trends in emissions In the period 2005 to 2011, Singapore achieved a reduction in the carbon intensity of its energy consumption of 14 per cent. This is in line with Singapore’s policy to lower carbon intensity through fuel switching and is significantly greater than the equivalent performance by Australia. However, overall emissions increased driven both by robust growth in GDP per capita and population, as well as increase in the energy intensity of the economy of 6.2 per cent, significantly worse than the performance achieved by Australia. Figure 20 shows the relative contribution of each of the factors identified earlier. Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). Kaya identity, decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) Australia ranks behind Singapore for additional renewable capacity in proportional terms. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity in the years 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. While Singapore achieved additional capacity of just over 250 MW, this represents a 1,260 per cent increase over its 2005 level. However, given the low absolute level of renewables penetration in Singapore, this data should be treated with care and a measure of the relationship between GDP growth and renewables capacity is not provided. Index (2005=100)   55 6.2 Future targets Singapore has targeted a reduction in GHG emissions of 16 per cent below BAU in 2020. While this target is contingent on a legally binding global agreement, it has nonetheless begun to implement the mitigation and energy efficiency measures, as announced under the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint in April 2009, to achieve it. In addition, Singapore is targeting a 7-11 per cent unconditional reduction in emissions to be achieved mainly through a 35 per cent reduction in energy intensity. If Australia maintains a five per cent target by 2020, Singapore will outperform it for two out of four metrics for measuring the extent of ambition across countries. The CCA did not include Singapore in its country analysis. We have therefore sought to replicate the analysis of the CCA using information of emissions as well as projections for GDP and population, looking at the 7 and 16 per cent emission reduction targets. Figure 21 shows that Singapore’s upper and lower targets are more ambitious than Australia’s five per cent target for per person emissions levels and emission intensity levels. Lower figure indicative of greater ambition for a given metric. Singapore low represents the lower 7% emissions reduction below BAU by 2020, while Singapore high represents the higher 16% reduction below BAU. Vivid Economics based on CCA 6.3 Projected trends Singapore’s National Climate Change Secretariat suggests that Singapore will reduce its GHG emissions by 11 per cent compared to Business As Usual in 2020. It estimates BAU emissions to be 77.2 MtCO2e compared to 68.7 MtCO2e in the low emissions scenario. Most of the reduction will be achieved in the power generation sector, accounting for 47 per cent of all reductions. A combination of fuel switching 2020 target indexed to Australia 5%   56 and the promotion of renewables are expected to achieve these reductions. However, it is not clear to what extent this represents a reliable assessment of future emissions trends, as opposed to an aspiration of where its targeted emission reductions will derive. It should also be noted that some stakeholders have criticised the BAU projections from the National Climate Change Secretariat as being inappropriately high (Low Carbon Singapore 2010). Projections from the Asian Development Bank also suggest Singapore emissions to lie 13 per cent below a baseline scenario in 2020 (Doshi 2013). This analysis suggests that GHG emissions are projected to be 66.5 MtCO2e under a baseline scenario that is consistent with policy implemented before 2007 but that policies implemented in the period to 2010 will help to reduce emissions by 13 per cent lower than the modelled baseline by 2020. If Singapore achieves the absolute level of emissions projected by this modelling exercise then this would constitute a 25 per cent reduction in emissions relative to the National Climate Change Secretariat’s BAU projection. A review of Singapore’s national sustainable development strategy is expected in 2014. Launched in 2009, the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint strategy contains a range of initiatives intended for the country to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability. The Inter-ministerial Committee on Sustainable Development, which launched the initial report, is reviewing it this year to take account of policy developments over the past five years (Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources 2014). Recent policy changes include measures to improve commercial and buildings’ energy efficiency as well as incentives for more efficient transport and increased renewables investment. 6.4.1 Commercial and buildings energy efficiency Large energy users in the industrial and energy sectors have recently been required to introduce energy management and improvement practices. The requirements apply to companies which have operational control over a business activity that exceeds 54TJ of energy per calendar year in at least two out of the three preceding calendar years (NEA 2013). The sectors targeted are: − manufacturing and manufacturing-related services; − electricity, gas, steam, compressed air and chilled water for air conditioning suppliers; and − water supply, sewage and waste management services. By October 2013, applicable companies were required to register with the National Environment Agency (NEA) and implement the following energy management practices: − appoint an energy manager; − monitor and report energy use and greenhouse gas emissions; and − submit annual energy efficiency improvement plans commencing 2014. In order to help companies improve their energy efficiency, Singapore has a range of programmes and incentives schemes in place. Some of the schemes the NEA (2013) has initiated in partnership with industry to achieve efficiency goals include:   57 − the Energy Efficiency National Partnership (EENP) programme: This is a platform to promote the adoption of energy management systems and share good energy efficiency practices between companies; − the Singapore Certified Energy Manager (SCEM) programme and training grant: this offers a formal training and certification system in the area of energy management, of which a grant covers about 80 per cent of training costs; − the Energy Efficiency Improvement Assistance Scheme (EASe): This encourages companies in the manufacturing and building sectors to carry out detailed technical assessments of their energy consumption so as to identify potential areas for energy efficiency improvements. The NEA co- funds up to 50 per cent of the cost of such energy appraisals; − the Grant for Energy Efficient Technologies (GREET): this encourages the uptake of energy efficient technologies and supports energy efficiency retrofits, by providing a grant to offset part of the investment cost. Co-funding of up to 20 per cent of the qualifying costs is provided, capped at S$4 million (A$3.49 million) per project. The country is also aiming to support Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) assess and improve their energy performance with a dedicated scheme. In July 2013, the government allocated S$17 million (A$14.9 million) to help approximately 300 enterprises achieve at least 10 per cent energy costs over the following three years (Spring Singapore 2013). SMEs may use Innovation and Capability Vouchers to engage one of 11 prequalified Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) to conduct an audit of their current energy usage and identify areas to improve energy efficiency. Funding is also available to install systems for long-term continuous self-monitoring of energy consumption. Finally, SMEs can avail of further funding for larger energy management projects involving optimising processes, redesigning workflows, or installing of energy-efficient equipment or technologies. Minimum standards for commercial buildings have recently been enacted and supports for retrofits have been increased. Further schemes encourage energy efficiency at design stage: − from the start of 2014, new regulations prescribed minimum environmental sustainability standards for existing buildings (Keung 2014); − in July 2012, the Green Mark Incentive Scheme, which provides cash incentives to encourage energy efficient retrofits, was enhanced to provide up to 50 per cent of costs, capped at S$3 million (A$2.62 million); − a Green Mark scheme provides funding for developers to engage environmental design consultants in the planning phase for new buildings; and − the ‘Design for Efficiency Scheme’ encourages investors in new facilities to integrate energy efficiency improvements into manufacturing development plans in the design stage (NEA 2014). The maximum amount of funding is 50 per cent of the qualifying costs or S$600,000 (A$436,900), whichever is lower. Qualifying costs include the costs of availing of technical expertise from engineers, architects and other contractors. 6.4.2 Other emissions mitigation strategies To promote greater energy efficiency in the transport sector, a system of rebates and penalties based on vehicle emissions was introduced in 2013. Under the Carbon Emissions-Based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), from January of last year all new car and imported used cars with carbon emissions of less than or  equal to 160g CO2/km qualify for rebates of between S$5,000 (A$4,369) and S$20,000 (A$17,477) (Land Transport Authority 2012). From July, vehicles with carbon emissions equal to or more than 211g CO2/km incur a corresponding registration surcharge of between $5,000 (A$4,369) and S$20,000 (A$17,477). The scheme is applicable until the end of 2014 at which point it will be reviewed. Despite limited scope for renewables, the country is undertaking a range of initiatives to encourage the use of renewable energy technology. Singapore has no hydro or geothermal power sources and low wind speeds. However there is limited scope for solar investment and this is being supported by the government. The Solar Capability Scheme provides grants of up to 30 percent for solar technology, capped at S$1million (A$0.87 million) per programme (KPMG 2013). The scheme’s objective is to encourage the integration of solar technologies into energy efficient buildings and build the capabilities of companies engaged in engineering, architecture and system integration. In addition, the government supports research institutes, such as the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, to study technical aspects of adapting solar energy to the country’s context. 6.5 Summary Singapore is on track to deliver an emissions reduction target that, on two out of four measures used by the CCA, is more ambitious than Australia’s 5 per cent target. While there are some concerns about the robustness of the BAU base from which it seeks to achieve its target, independent modelling analysis identifies a significant deviation in emissions accounted for by policy action. These actions include concerted efforts to improve energy efficiency as well as incremental efforts to boost renewables.   59 7 South Korea 7.1 Recent trends in emissions South Korea emissions rose by 25 per cent in the period 2005-2011 due to rapid economic growth. By contrast, carbon intensity and energy intensity had very meagre contributions to GHG emissions. Figure 22 shows the relative contribution of each of the factors identified earlier: — Growth in GDP per capita was substantial at 20 per cent over the period, explaining the bulk of the emissions growth; — South Korea’s carbon intensity went up by 1 per cent, rising in 2008 after an initial decline; — the energy intensity of South Koreas economy decreased by 1 per cent; — population growth was also relatively low with a 3.4 per cent increase. On both carbon intensity and energy intensity, Australia performed better than South Korea over this period. Kaya decomposition sourced from IEA (OECD/IEA 2013a). Kaya identity decomposes emission as the product of population, GDP per capita, energy use per unit of GDP and carbon emission per unit of energy consumption. The components are in index form, rebased so that the value of the index for each component is 100 in 2005. IEA’s CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, Highlights (OECD/IEA 2013a) Nonetheless, tested vehicle fuel economy in South Korea indicates its fleet outperforms that of Australia. IEA analysis of the fuel economy of new light vehicle registrations in 2010 shows the South  Korean fleet achieved a fuel economy of 7.7 lge/100km. This figure strongly outperformed Australia’s 9.1 lge/100km. Australia also ranks behind South Korea for additional renewable capacity, both in proportional terms and in terms of responsiveness to GDP growth. Australia’s additional 3,000 MW of renewable capacity in the years 2005-11 represents growth of 32 per cent. While South Korea achieved a lower absolute capacity addition, at 1,580 MW, this nevertheless represents growth of 89 per cent over its 2005 level. Growth in renewables was also more responsive to GDP growth: every 1 per cent increase in GDP in South Korea was associated with a 2.90 per cent increase in renewables capacity during 2005-11 against 1.49 per cent in Australia. South Korea has targeted a reduction in emissions of 30 per cent below BAU in 2020. This goal equates to an absolute reduction of four per cent below 2005 levels. This is one of the key elements of an overarching Green Growth Strategy which envisages Korea becoming a world-leader in green technologies. If Australia maintains a five per cent target by 2020, South Korea’s target will be more ambitious than Australia’s on three out of four CCA metrics. As indicated in Figure 23, South Korea’s 30 per cent target is more ambitious in terms of emission intensity levels, departure from BAU and per person emissions. 7.3 Projected trends In the third National Communication to the UN, South Korea identified all of the required reductions that can enable it to meet its 2020 emissions target (Korea/MoE 2011). In order to achieve an overall decrease of 234 MtCO2e in GHG emissions, South Korea projects 170 MtCO2e of abatement from the energy sector and a further 60 MtCO2e from industrial processes. To meet its target, South Korea plans to rely primarily on an Emissions Trading Scheme (discussed below), which will start operating in 2015, while emissions reductions in other sectors are much smaller. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency suggests Korea is on track to achieve a 24 per cent emissions reduction compared to BAU in 2020. The Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL 2013) predicts emissions abatement from ETS, in combination with additional renewables deployment, to deliver approximately 185 MtCO2e of abatement, which will put South Korea’s emissions 24 per cent lower than BAU in 2020. This is shown in Figure 24. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has recently re-emphasised her country’s commitment to tackling climate change both domestically and abroad. At the opening address of the headquarters of the Korean-based Green Climate Fund, she stressed that her administration had established climate change as a priority issue and that it was committed to co-operate with other countries to tackle it: ‘Climate change cannot be put off until tomorrow but is an issue that requires immediate action today from all members of the global community. All countries and international organisations, all governments and businesses and all civil societies must take action before it is too late... Together with the Green Climate Fund and the international community, Korea will actively partake in the effort to respond to climate change’ (Government of Korea 2013a). The President committed to South Korea taking an active approach to climate change with policies that not only mitigate its effects but also help to provide opportunities for new growth engines. President Park said that her administration would designate responding to climate change as a key element of building a ‘creative economy’ with specific policies focussing on: − investment in new and renewable energy sources; − energy management systems; and − carbon capture and storage and carbon pricing. Korea’s experience in developing technologies in these areas will be shared with the international community to ‘contribute to the global spread of a system in which growth and the environment form a virtuous cycle’ (Government of Korea 2013a). Commentators have noted that these remarks are in keeping with an increasingly positive tone towards responding to climate change from the administration in recent months. When President Kim came to office in early 2013, she downgraded the Presidential Committee on Green Growth, a high-level co- ordinating body to advance the climate agenda, to a prime ministerial committee in an apparent move to distance herself from her predecessors’ green policies (Kim and Thurbon 2014). However, while the initial downgrade led to concerns the committee would not retain the same authority, a recent re-launch of the commission has given it an expanded role in drawing in contributions from academic and civil society groups (The Korea Herald 2013). It is focussed on implementing and extending previously enacted initiatives with policymakers discussing a ‘Green Growth 2.0’ agenda. Consistent with this, South Korea is also taking an international lead on carbon pricing mechanisms; it was the first Asian country to pass a national economy-wide ETS into law with implementation commencing in 2015. Companies that emit over 125,000 tCO2e per annum will require allowances for each tonne of GHG emissions they produce, although the inter-ministerial task force may revise the cap. As currently envisaged, 490 of the country’s largest emitters, 15 which account for roughly 60 per cent of the country’s annual GHG emissions, will be subject to emission caps (Environmental Defense Fund 2013). During phase I (2015-17), 100 per cent of allowances will be freely allocated, falling to a maximum of 97 per cent in phase II (2018-2020) and 90 per cent in phase III (2021-26) with the balance auctioned in each case. Analysis of the scheme (Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2013) suggests that it is ambitious and that   63 the price of carbon is likely be high compared to other schemes. The government will agree the final details of the scheme, including allocation methods, controlled sectors and sectoral allowances, in mid-2014. In August 2013 the government announced a plan to promote investment in renewable technologies by setting revised targets and reforming regulations. The ‘Plan for promoting the renewable energy industry’ (Government of Korea 2013b): − increases the quota for solar photovoltaic power by 150MW in 2014 and a further 150MW in 2015 such that it will reach 1.5GW in order to facilitate the expansion of the market; − reforms planning processes for the construction of renewable energy facilities and power lines; − expands renewable heat energy obligations on newly constructed buildings from ten per cent in 2016-19 rising to 30 per cent by 2030; − increases public buildings’ renewable energy obligations from the current 20 per cent to 30 per cent in 2020; and − changes the basis for subsidies for renewables from unit capacity to quantity of energy supplied. This built on changes to the incentive regime for renewable power, where a feed-in-tariff mechanism for facilitating renewable energy production was replaced in 2012 with a system of Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) under a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). This obliges the 13 largest public and private utilities to increase the share of renewables in their generation portfolios to 10 per cent by 2022. This can be achieved by building their own plant or by buying RECs from green energy suppliers. Penalty payments are charged for any shortfalls. There are also plans for significant public investment in renewables. The government plans to invest US$8.2 billion (A$9.14 billion) in offshore wind farms in order to reach a wind capacity of 2.5 GW by 2019, from a base of just 0.3 GW in 2008. The country has also been an early adopter of domestic energy efficiency measures, and announced it intends to ban the production and import of incandescent light bulbs after 2014. After its introduction 21 years ago, the number of products that received certification as part of the Eco-label scheme topped 10,000 in 2013. In addition, low efficiency lighting has been targeted with the incandescent lamp exit management system resulting in 99 per cent of such lighting being removed from the public sector. The move to high-efficiency lighting for the whole economy is expected to be accelerated when the production and import of incandescent bulbs is banned after 2014 (Energy Korea 2013). 7.5 Summary South Korea has set itself an ambitious emissions reduction target – the CCA analysis suggesting that it is more ambitious than Australia’s current five per cent metric on three out of the four metrics considered. While independent forecasts suggest that it is not yet on track to fully meet this target, the imminent establishment of a national ETS – which forecasts suggest will have higher prices than in any other ETS scheme currently operating – indicates that it is committed to taking significant climate action. While its historic performance in reducing either the energy intensity of the economy or the carbon intensity of its energy consumption has not been as strong as in Australia, the relative growth of renewables in Korea has been stronger and the fuel efficiency of its new light duty vehicles fleet is greater.

WWF-2014-2.txt,"REPORT 20THIS REPORT HAS BEEN PRODUCED IN COLLABORATION WITH  Critical materials for the transition to a 100% sustainable energy future    Executive summary  This study examines whether non-energy raw material supply bottlenecks could occur in the transition to a fully sustainable energy system. Such a transition is represented in The Energy Report, published in 2011 by WWF and Ecofys, which shows a way to almost 100% renewable energy by 2050 coupled with strong energy efficiency efforts in all sectors.  The most critical supply bottlenecks of non-energy raw materials are lithium and cobalt, which are used for batteries in electric vehicles. These bottlenecks can be alleviated by recycling lithium, substituting lithium in other sectors, and by using less cobalt-intensive cathodes. By contrast indium, gallium and tellurium are not expected to become important bottlenecks. Their use in solar power (photovoltaics) can be substituted by applying technologies requiring less critical materials, such as silicon. The use of indium and gallium for energy efficient lighting is very small compared to production in 2011. Supply bottlenecks are likely to pose less of a problem also for copper, which is used for transition grids and increasingly for more capture wind and solar energy and in energy efficient motors.  The authors of this study used the following approaches: A quick scan was carried out to identify areas where bottlenecks might occur. These bottlenecks were further analysed by taking information from The Energy Report, such as the installed electric capacity, amount of vehicles or building area, and multiplying this with the material intensity of the different technologies, such as the amount of tellurium per GW installed capacity of photovoltaics. These calculations resulted in the maximum material demand for a technology, both on a yearly basis as well as cumulative for the period 2012 to 2050. The maximum material demand per year was compared with the production of that material in 2011. The cumulative demand for the material was compared with the reserves and the resources of that material. Ways of mitigating material scarcities were also investigated.  So-called `rare earths', including neodymium and yttrium, and which are needed for wind turbines, are expected to exceed the demand. However, rare earths are nevertheless considered a bottleneck for other, geopolitical reasons. The majority of current production is concentrated in a single country, China. In recent years, rare earths have been the subject of export restrictions, which have given rise to concerns in, for instance, Japan, the United States and Europe. Eliminating these geopolitical constraints in the short term is difficult, but is possible in the longer term as resources become available in other geographical areas as well.  This study concludes that although the scenario in The Energy Report leads to additional material demand for specific applications, there are also significant material savings related to the high energy and material efficiency pathways chosen for these scenarios. As a result, the overall impact on scarce resources in a highly renewable powered and energy-efficient world is likely to be substantially smaller than in a scenario with more modest sustainable energy ambitions. However, new political legislation in all major economies to promote material recycling and drive substantial technological development is still required to increase material efficiency.    Foreword About 3 years ago, WWF launched its energy vision to arrive at a 100% renewable energy powered economy by 2050.  Global politics permitting we know that sustainable renewable energy can fuel the world reliably while overcoming threats of climate change, air pollution and high economic costs for the majority of countries from increased import costs of fossil fuels. While a vision for a fossil fuel and nuclear free global energy supply by 2050 is environmentally sound and a key condition to stay well below 2 degree global warming, reduce nuclear risks and substantially diminish air pollution which still kills more than 3 million people annually and mostly in developing countries, such a vision seems to imply that clean renewables have no limits and resource constraints.  Dr Stephan Singer, Director Global Energy Policy, WWF International  It is true that the simple amount of clean energy from sun, wind and geothermal alone can power our global energy demand by more than 100 times. It is, however, not true that the overall renewable energy supply chain and conversion technologies have no limits. We need more grids, more transformers, more batteries, simply more materials, new specialised materials, more rare earth materials, copper, lithium etc. for highly innovative and modern energy technologies that provide a close to zeroemission energy sector. But we also know that mining of materials has a footprint in nature, creates waste, consumes fresh water, and that often practices of these non-energy minerals mined are highly dangerous and extremely polluting in some developing countries. In addition, some of these minerals are limited and not highly concentrated in the Earth crust.  Modern, innovative energy-related technologies often have a high demand for these materials. And they do not stand alone. Modern information technology sectors from computers to TV flat screens and mobile phones, various industrial applications and processes, lighting technologies and transport applications also increasingly require these materials.  For a long-term 100% renewable energy vision powered by modern technologies and assuming substantive growth and demand for all kind of other industrial technologies worldwide, and particular in developing countries, we need to make sure that there are no bottlenecks. Already some authorities and institutions warn of shortages of some rare earth materials before 2020. Though geologically we may not run out of rare earths that easily and that fast, 90% of worldwide production of these materials is presently concentrated in China. And in some cases, such as lithium for electric car drives and batteries, we may see shortages as this report by Ecofys documents.  Hence, a strong focus on energy efficiency and conservation is paramount to reduce non-energy material needs for the emerging renewable energy technologies worldwide. Also, WWF strongly urges all governments to legislate as soon as possible strong incentives and create regulations for enhanced recycling and reuse of precious and rare materials. In parallel, research and development shall be fostered for new materials and high material efficiency. This will not only provide a sufficient flow for materials for highly-innovative technologies and applications both in energy and non-energy usage, but also reduce overall environmental and social impacts of mining non-renewable resources.  Page 2 | Critical Materials for the Transition to a 100% Sustainable Energy Future   We are happy to see the evidence in this Ecofys report that a transition to a 100% sustainable energy supply is possible, in spite of supply chain bottlenecks, which can be mitigated through increased recycling and substitution. Stephan Singer, January 20 Lithium being extracted from ore. The demand for lithium, a major component in batteries for cell phones, laptops and electric vehicles, is expected to increase rapidly and is widely regarded as a key bottleneck for the large scale introduction of electric vehicles.   There are increasing concerns about the future availability Introduction of mined and non-renewable minerals and materials for our society. This concern focuses especially on rare earth metals, but also includes more common metals such as copper and aluminium. The upcoming material requirements for sustainable energy technologies is crucial in the debate, though non-energy material needs such as for IT and highly specialised manufacturing and modern transport industries also claim an ever larger share of these extractive non-renewable minerals. The development of a fully sustainable energy system will definitely lead to a change of material demands compared to a business-as-usual development of the conventional energy system. However, and strongly depending on overall successes in material, resource and energy efficiency, it remains to be seen whether the entire package of technologies belonging to a 100% sustainable renewable energy scenario actually leads to a higher net resource demand. This study investigates what material supply bottlenecks may occur in a transition to a 100% sustainable energy system, and how these bottlenecks can be overcome. It bases its calculations on the 100% sustainable energy scenario presented in The Energy Report (TER), a study produced by WWF and Ecofys in 2011. The critical materials report is divided up into five chapters.  Chapter 1 is this introduction.  Chapter 2 provides an overview of material production worldwide and a quick scan of materials for which supply bottlenecks may occur in future.  Chapter 3 describes which critical materials impact on which sustainable energy production technologies utilised in The Energy Report.  Chapter 4 provides a detailed assessment of ten critical material bottlenecks for TER, including proposed mitigation measures.  Chapter 5 compares the material demand related to The Energy Report scenario with a business as usual scenario from the International Energy Agency (IEA).   2.Supply Bottlenecks for Material Resources Worldwide    Supply This chapter contains an overview of non-biomass, non-renewable Bottlenecks mineral material production worldwide and a quick scan of materials for which supply for Material bottlenecks may occur in future. Biotic resources, such as fish and timber, and fuel resources, such Resources as coal and oil, are excluded from this analysis. Included are metals, such as copper (Cu), platinum Worldwide (Pt) and rare earth elements, and industrial minerals such as barite (BaSO4) and fluorspar (CaF2). Materials production, resource and reserves worldwide This chapter considers current materials production, resources and reserves worldwide. In resource accounting, the distinction between reserves and resources is important:  `Resources' are everything that is known and expected to exist somewhere. They are defined as materials of economic interest for extraction, which either now or in the future become commercially available (EU, 2010. USGS, 2012).  `Reserves' are everything for which there is reasonable certainty about where they are located. They are defined as ""a subset of resources which are fully geologically evaluated and which can be economically, legally and immediately extracted; reserves are often described as the `working inventory' of a mining company, which is continually updated according to changing economic, technological, legal and political situations"" (EU, 2010. USGS, 2012). In general, these definitions are almost identical to those used with fossil fuels. High commodity prices increase the reserve base while lower ones reduce its size. While production figures are generally available, estimating reserves and resources on a global scale involves some uncertainty. Information about materials of strategic importance (e.g. radioactive materials, materials used in weapons production) is often not publically available. In addition, production figures of some of the rarer materials (e.g. many of the rare earth elements) are not always readily available since these materials are often traded directly via long term delivery contracts rather than on the open global market. Further detail is provided in chapter 3 on how these uncertainties should be taken into account when analysing critical materials. Page 8 | Critical Materials for the Transition to a 100% Sustainable Energy Future   We distinguish the group of rare earths and the specific group of platinum group metals (PGMs). These groups consist of respectively seventeen and six different metals. Rare earths are: scandium (Sc), yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er) and thulium (Tm). Platinum group metals are: platinum (Pt), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh) and palladium (Pd). Each is often grouped together because they are generally mined and processed as a group.  As can be seen in Table 1, many of the materials currently in demand worldwide are not considered to have near or long term supply bottlenecks. Many resources are available for over 100 years, sometimes even over 1000 years. There are a few exceptions. Zirconium (Zr) and molybdenum (Mo) resources are only expected to last for respectively 43 and 56 years at current production levels. Reserves are clearly more constrained than resources, sometimes down to only 20 years. Notably low reserves to production ratios are present for antimony (Sb), strontium (Sr), gold (Au), lead (Pb) and tin (Sn), which are each below 20 years. Note that the reserves to production and resources to production ratios are not always good indicators for the likelihood of a supply chain bottleneck, as they only are relevant for materials with a stable demand. With rapidly increasing demand, exhaustion may happen much earlier. On the other hand, developments in reuse, recycling and substitution of critical metals can alleviate the exhaustion of materials. Materials judged to be vulnerable to supply bottlenecks, i.e. critical materials, will now be considered further. Molybdenum (Mo), a rare earth mineral, resources are only expected to last for 56 years at current production levels.   Materials which are vulnerable to supply bottlenecks The scarcity of a particular material and whether or not it can lead to a supply chain bottleneck depends on a lot of factors. First of all, the total amount of material and the part of this which is potentially recoverable. Secondly, the development of demand in the future and to which extent supply can be adjusted to meet changes in demand. This is also affected by the possibilities of recycling and substituting the material. Thirdly, the geological distribution of the material supply, which can lead to trade disruptions and supply risks. This last factor is up for debate. When the transition to a sustainable energy system is looked at from a global perspective, the distribution of the material over individual countries is not relevant and geopolitical factors do not play a role. This section considers which materials from Table 1 are vulnerable to supply bottlenecks. This is done by analysing six recent reports which identify critical materials for various sectors:  Ad-hoc Working Group on defining critical raw materials ­ Critical raw materials for the EU (2010). The Working Group has identified 14 critical materials at the EU level based on supply risk and economic importance. These include platinum group metals (PGMs) and the rare earths.  The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies ­ Scarcity of Minerals: A strategic security issue (2010). The HCSS has identified 15 individual elements, as well as the rare earths and PGMs, as critical materials using the following criteria: the importance of the metals for the high tech industrial sector, the limited availability of substitutes and the elements which are essential to emerging technologies and `green technologies' in particular.  Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport ­ Supply chain bottlenecks in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (2010). This study identifies supply chain bottlenecks based on technologies included in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, focusing on a wide range of renewable energy technologies, including wind power, onshore and offshore, solar photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), carbon capture and storage (CCS), advanced biofuels, nuclear power generation, fuel cells and hydrogen in transport, solar thermal, electricity networks.  Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport ­ Critical Metals in Strategic Energy Technologies (2011). This study assesses 14 metals which are used in large quantities in technologies presented in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, considering market and political factors to divide the metals into three groups: high risk, medium risk and low risk. For our analysis, Ecofys focuses on materials considered high and medium risk, with low risk metals considered where relevant to the deployment of renewable and energy efficient technologies.  APS Panel on Public Affairs & The Materials Research Society ­ Energy Critical Elements: Securing Materials for Emerging Technologies (2011). This report considers `energy-critical elements', which are defined as elements for which scarcity can significantly hamper the introduction of game-changing energy technologies, with energy-critical  elements grouped according to their usage. For the rare earths, specifically dysprosium (Dy), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), samarium (Sm), gadolinium (Gd), europium (Eu), terbium (Tb) and yttrium (Y) are mentioned.  United Nations Environment Programme ­ Critical Metals for Future Sustainable Technologies and their Recycling Potential (2009). This report identifies critical metals for future sustainable technologies such as renewable energy production and energy efficiency technologies, based on demand growth, supply risks and recycling restrictions and classifying metals according to whether they will be critical on the short, medium or long term. Table 2 below shows the subset of materials from Table 1 which are identified in the six reports as vulnerable to supply bottlenecks. Some of the studies from Table 2 mention the platinum group metals as a group, while others mention them individually (platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and ruthenium (Ru)). The same holds for rare earths, which are mentioned as a group in some studies and as individual elements in others. The next chapter considers the implications of these critical metals for transitioning to a 100% sustainable energy system.    3. Critical Materials for Transitioning to a 100% Sustainable Energy System    Critical Materials This chapter for Transitioning to assesses which critical materials will impact on a 100% Sustainable the sustainable energy production technologies Energy System utilised in a fully sustainable energy system. This fully sustainable energy system is as represented in The Energy Report (TER) and identifies which material supply bottlenecks are recommended for more detailed analysis in the following chapter. In that chapter, a full analysis will be given of the expected material requirement for building a fully sustainable energy system. That material requirement will then be compared to the long-term availability of materials. The first part of this chapter describes the technologies from the TER and gives a general indication of their material requirements. The second part lists the most important bottlenecks, based on the technologies from the TER and information on critical materials. Critical materials for sustainable energy production technologies The six studies used to make the overview of critical metals in Chapter 2 each have their own basis for determining whether a material is critical or not. For this study, only the materials which might lead to a bottleneck for the TER scenario are of interest. The 100% renewable energy scenario which forms the basis for TER contains many different renewable energy supply technologies and energy efficiency technologies across the transport, built environment and industrial sectors. However, not all of these technologies are dependent on the materials identified in Chapter 2 and not all are vulnerable to materials supply bottlenecks.  Solar energy - Solar energy is an important consumer of critical materials. In the TER scenario, solar energy supplies half of our total electricity demand in 2050, half of our building heating and 15% of industrial heat and fuel. Solar energy can be subdivided into photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, lowtemperature heating and `concentrating solar heat'. Photovoltaics can be further subdivided into silicon-based crystalline cells and thin film cells. Especially for thin film cells photovoltaics, which require several types of scarce materials, solar energy is an important consumer of critical materials  bottlenecks can occur. In addition, a large increase in photovoltaics will cause an increase in demand for silver, tin and silicon.  Wind energy - If wind energy is deployed on a large scale, as is foreseen in the TER, it could become a significant consumer of critical materials, particularly for the production of permanent magnets for direct-drive solutions. An additional 1,000,000 onshore and 100,000 offshore wind turbines could meet a quarter of the world's electricity needs in 2050 (Ecofys, 2011). In addition to scarce materials, copper is also required for the transformers needed for the wind turbines. How a large scale increase in wind energy affects supply and demand of these materials, is elaborated upon further on in the report.  Wave and tidal energy - Wave and tidal energy, which make a relatively small contribution to the TER scenario, will not be significantly affected by a scarcity of critical materials, with the possible exception of copper for generators.  Hydropower - Hydropower is not anticipated to be significantly affected by critical material bottlenecks despite the use of copper, since the amount of copper required per MW electricity is relatively low due to the large scale of hydropower stations.  Geothermal power - Geothermal power requires copper for heat exchangers. Especially with the increase in installed capacity of geothermal power, this could affect future copper demand. However, no reliable quantitative data is available.  Efficiency in industry - Improving energy efficiency in the industrial sector includes a wide variety of measures (Ecofys, 2009). On the one hand this will involve integration of processes and process intensification, which will lead to a reduction in material usage. On the other hand, there will be add-on technologies, like heat exchangers and power speed control. Heat exchangers require materials with a large thermal conductivity, such as copper and aluminium. Power speed control equipment requires power semiconductors. In addition, lightweight and more durable alloys can improve the efficiency of machinery, such as motors and drives, making them useful for process improvements. For chemical processes, catalysts are important. Improvements in catalysts, which often include critical materials such as PGMs, can lead to energy efficiency improvements in industry. The materials used in catalysts, however, are so diverse, that not one specific critical material stands out. In addition, since their usage is already widespread in industry, the projected increase in demand for these materials due to additional energy efficiency measures in TER will not be exceptional. Finally, in comparison with other industrial energy efficiency improvements, catalysts are only a small aspect. New catalysts are not critical for achieving the TER scenario and will therefore not become a material bottleneck. With the exception of control equipment, which composes only a small part of efficiency improvements in industry, efficiency improvements in industry do not require critical materials.  Low carbon transport ­ Low carbon transport involves improving energy efficiency, fuel switching to biofuels and electric vehicles. Improving energy efficiency includes measures such as using lighter materials, improving aerodynamics and making more efficient engines. This requires lightweight materials such as carbon fibre and super alloys, which are stronger, lighter and    more durable than conventional alloys and require scarce materials such as molybdenum and tungsten. Switching from fossil fuels to electricity will see increased demand for materials to produce, for example, electrical engines, batteries, loading stations for fuels. High density energy storage devices, which are mainly batteries containing lithium or cobalt, will be required for electric vehicles.   Energy efficiency in the built environment - Energy efficiency in the built environment is dominated by two main measures: insulation and installations. · Insulation is of key importance in the TER. Heating and cooling of new buildings should require virtually no energy by 2030 and existing buildings should have energy demands for heating and cooling reduced by 60%. Most of the materials used for insulation, such as mineral wool and foam, do not require critical materials. · Installations include the energy-using infrastructure within buildings, including heat pumps, air conditioning and lighting. A heat pump contains a heat exchanger, which contains high conductivity materials such as copper and aluminum, as well as less common materials such as selenium and chromium. Energy efficient lighting consists of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and fluorescent lamps, which require critical materials such as gallium, indium and rare earths. Energy efficient homes also make use of smart electronics which help save energy in households and offices, for example by turning off equipment that isn't used, regulating temperature and preventing the waste of food. These smart electronics contain semiconductors, which contain scarce materials such as indium and gallium. Scarce materials for semiconductors are discussed further on in this report.   Infrastructure - In order to switch to a 100% renewable energy scenario, the energy transport, distribution and storage infrastructure has to adapt to a more flexible, decentralised energy system. This will result in additional material demand, most notably copper for instance for the enlarged transmission grid infrastructure.  Semiconductors, which are used for a wide variety of purposes, are included in many applications in for instance the built environment and industry. Depending on their purpose, semiconductors are designed using different materials. Further on in the report, a brief assessment is included on whether materials for semiconductors can become a bottleneck for the implementation of a fully sustainable energy system as represented in The Energy Report (TER). Biomass is used in TER for specific purposes where no other renewable energy sources are available. An increased production of biomass will result in an increased demand of both organic and artificial fertilisers. The total amounts, however, may differ based on selection and use of crops, plant materials and their products, management practices, regions and technological progress as well as specific demand for biofuels. The three main components of artificial fertilisers are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. This study contains a concise assessment of whether the supply of these materials can become a bottleneck for the implementation of the TER scenario.  dentifying technologies that suffer from specific critical material bottlenecks is complex. In this study, Ecofys has drawn on a broad range of sources including the six studies listed in chapter 2, as well as scientific publications and Ecofys' informed expert opinion. Table 3 lists the critical materials identified for the TER technology sectors which are most likely to be affected by supply bottlenecks.  Critical materials bottlenecks for detailed assessment  copper is not critical for one particular technology but for the system as a whole  This section identifies critical materials bottlenecks for achieving a fully sustainable energy system as represented in The Energy Report (TER) that will be the focus of the more detailed analysis in the following chapter. These have been selected on the basis of:  the number of studies that emphasise the critical material for the technology  the expected quantities of the material required for the technologies, relative to other critical materials (informed expert judgement)  having representation across as many TER technologies that will be impacted by critical materials as possible. Using these selection criteria, the critical materials bottlenecks to be the focus of the detailed analysis are proposed to be:  tellurium, indium and gallium specifically for thin film photovoltaics and silver for photovoltaics · These first three critical materials are identified from literature review as the three critical materials of greatest importance for thin film photovoltaics. In addition, silver, which is used in several types of photovoltaics, is also expected to be critical.  indium and gallium for energy efficient lighting · Additional critical materials, such as rare earths, were identified for energy efficient lighting, however assessing two materials only will still allow for representation of the key issues and challenges associated with critical materials for this technology (and allow resources for this project to be deployed between a greater number of TER technologies). · Indium and gallium were selected as the two materials to analyse in more detail, but it would have been equally valid to have selected alternative materials.  rare earths, used for magnets in wind turbines, in particular neodymium and yttrium · Rare earths are one of the most important bottlenecks for wind turbines, being mentioned in almost all the studies on critical materials. · Other materials such as cobalt, manganese and molybdenum are also potential material bottlenecks for wind turbines.  Energy efficient lighting requires critical materials such as gallium, indium and rare earths   materials used in smart electronics in the built environment and power electronics in industry · Smart electronics and power electronics in the built environment and industry require semiconductors, which contain different types of scarce materials, depending on their purpose. Examples are arsenic, germanium, indium and gallium. Semiconductors are a complicated topic which requires further research. During this study, more information on materials required for semiconductors will be collected and where bottlenecks occur, these will be explained.  cobalt and lithium for high energy density batteries for electric transport · Demand for lithium, a major component in batteries for cell phones, laptops and electric vehicles, is expected to increase rapidly and is widely regarded as a key bottleneck for the large scale introduction of electric vehicles. · Cobalt is another important component of lithium ion batteries; it is also used for making super alloys and in wind turbines.  copper for electricity distribution and energy supply · Copper is a main component of electricity distribution networks and could become a bottleneck for developing the flexible, decentralised energy system required to realise the TER scenario. In addition, copper is used in many other renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar energy but also in transformers and motors. · It stands apart from the previously mentioned materials because it is not critical for one particular technology but for the system as a whole. A more detailed analysis on copper is presented further on in this report.  nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium for biomass · In the TER scenario, biomass is used where no other renewable energy sources are available. The enhanced production of biomass requires organic and artificial fertilizers, which have nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as their main components. This study will contain a brief assessment on whether material bottlenecks will occur for biomass in the TER scenario.   4. Detailed Assessment of Bottleneck Areas    This chapter provides a detailed Detailed Assessment assessment of the potential bottleneck of Bottleneck Areas areas identified in the previous chapter. It calculates the maximum annual material demand and the cumulative material demand for each bottleneck to 2050 and then compares both these figures with the production, reserves and resources of the material in 2011.  As explained in chapter 2, the distinction between reserves and resources is:   29% 0f total electricity production is from photovoltaic energy   Reserves - are everything for which there is reasonable certainty about where they are located. They are defined as ""a subset of resources which are fully geologically evaluated and which can be economically, legally and immediately extracted; reserves are often described as the `working inventory' of a mining company, which is continually updated according to changing economic, technological, legal and political situations"" (EU, 2010. USGS, 2012). The basis for the calculations is the data from The Energy Report (TER). The sources for the data used in the calculations and the reasoning behind the assumptions made for the calculations are explained in each chapter. The only exception is the bottleneck for semiconductors, which is explained qualitatively rather than quantitatively. For each of the bottlenecks, the results of the calculations are shown in a graph and further analysed in a separate paragraph. A brief supply forecast and some information on supply risks is also included. For each of the bottlenecks, mitigation measures, e.g. options for recycling and substitution, are mentioned.  Indium, gallium, tellurium and silver for photovoltaics The two main technologies in photovoltaics are thin film photovoltaics and crystalline photovoltaics. For thin film photovoltaics, indium, gallium and tellurium are potential material bottlenecks. For crystalline photovoltaics, silver is a potential material bottleneck. In 2050, The Energy Report (TER) assumes that around 29% of total electricity production is from photovoltaic energy. With an estimated annual electricity production of 127.4 EJ, this means 37 EJ is produced by photovoltaics in TER. For thin film photovoltaics, four different technologies exist. It has been assumed that each of these technologies will have a market share of 25% in 2050. These thin film photovoltaics are the following:  CdTe ­ cadmium and telluride, with tellurium as a potential bottleneck  CI(G)S - copper, indium, selenium and optionally gallium, with indium as a potential bottleneck  GaAs - gallium, arsenic (and optionally germanium), with gallium as a potential bottleneck  aSi ­ silicon, with no bottlenecks identified. The material intensities for each of these technologies and for silver in crystalline photovoltaics are taken from Wild - Scholten (2007) and Fraunhofer (2009). For all four materials, a progress ratio1 of 85% is assumed. This progress ratio is used to calculate the decrease in material intensity over time. For the material calculations, it was assumed that the 37 EJ produced by photovoltaics in 2050 is either met by 100% crystalline photovoltaics or by 100% thin film photovoltaics.  Analysis of materials in photovoltaics  The annual capacity increase of photovoltaics until 2050, and hence also the annual material demand attributed to photovoltaics, were calculated based on annual energy production figures in the TER scenario. Figure 1 shows a comparison between the maximum material demand for one year and production of that material in 2011.   The TER scenario was also used to calculate the cumulative material demand for deploying the photovoltaics capacity up to 2050. Figure 2 shows a comparison of cumulative material demand with the reserves and resources of the materials in 2011. As can be seen in Figure 1, with silver being the notable exception, the maximum annual demand for gallium, indium and tellurium exceeds current production by far. On the other hand, in spite of the lack of information on reserves and resources of many of the materials, Figure 2 shows us that current reserves and resources are in principle able to accommodate the cumulative material demand for photovoltaics until 2050. As can be seen in Figure 2, reserves for silver are currently sufficient to meet cumulative silver demand for photovoltaics, even in a 100% crystalline scenario. When looking at the material requirements in Figure 1 and Figure 2, one should take into account that in reality, it is most likely a mix of crystalline and thin film photovoltaics will be used. This means that total material requirements will be spread over crystalline and thin film photovoltaics. In addition, economic principles will cause a shift to a different technology when material scarcity drives up prices for a certain materials. This will cause the shift to technologies with less material restrictions. In addition to the demand from photovoltaics, material demand arising from other technologies can put additional strain on the market for these materials. An example is the increase in demand for smart phones and light emitting diodes (LEDs), both containing gallium. Currently, the main application of gallium (66%) is in integrated circuits, used in computers and telecommunications. 18% of gallium is used for laser diodes and LEDs and 14% is used in R&D activities. At the moment, only 2% of gallium is used in photovoltaics (UNIA, 2011). An increased demand for gallium for  integrated circuits and LEDs can put additional strain on the supply of gallium for photovoltaics. In addition to bottlenecks caused by a mismatch between supply and demand, bottlenecks can also occur because of geopolitical constraints. An example is the fact that over 50% of refined indium production is controlled by China (UNIA, 2011). Disruptions in trade routes could result in short term material bottlenecks. Key mitigation measures For the three thin film photovoltaic technologies containing indium, gallium and tellurium, substitution can take place with silicon, for which no bottlenecks are expected (USGS, 2012) Indium  Indium is currently considered an impurity in the production process of zinc (JRC, 2011). When an increase in demand for indium causes prices for indium to increase, this will be an economic incentive to produce indium as a co-product of zinc production.  Research into the substitution of indium in Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) is underway and is estimated to become commercially available in the next three years. This could free up additional indium for photovoltaics. Gallium arsenide can substitute for indium phosphide in solar cells, but this is a scarce material as well. (USGS, 2012).  Recycling of indium from flat panel displays will become an important aspect of maintaining an adequate indium supply, noting that 74% of total indium consumption is for flat panel displays (JRC, 2011) and hence increasing demand for flat screen displays can put additional strain on the supply of indium for photovoltaics. Gallium  Recycling from electronic scrap is currently non-existent and is difficult because the waste stream is small and dissipative.  There is little research put into the substitution of gallium in solar cells, but substitution will probably lead to lower efficiencies (UNIA, 2011). Possibilities for substituting gallium in LEDs and lasers are being researched (USGS, 2012).  Current gallium production mainly takes place as a by-product of the production of other metals, such as zinc and aluminium. Currently, less than 10% of gallium in bauxite is recovered, mainly due to a lack of refining equipment (JRC, 2011). This means that a gallium bottleneck might be prevented by increasing gallium production by constructing additional refining equipment. This will be more attractive when the economics for recovering gallium become more favourable.    Tellurium  Recycling rates are currently very small, but could increase when PV cells are being recycled. Recovery of tellurium from electronic scraps is difficult due to its dissipative use in small electronics.  For most of its uses, tellurium can be substituted for a different material, although this does lead to production efficiency losses or product characteristics (USGS, 2012). Silver  For several of its current applications, silver could be substituted by other materials. Hence, if supply constraints would arise; silver supply could shift from other applications, such as cutlery and jewellery, to photovoltaics.  Current recycling rates are between 30 and 50%. Good candidates for increasing the recycling rate are jewellery, coinage, catalysts and electronics (UNIA, 2011). A further increase in the price of precious metals will make additional recycling more attractive (UNEP, 2011). Conclusion For some photovoltaics technologies, supply bottlenecks can be expected, but in all cases there are ways to at least partly overcome them. But it is anyway possible to continue with currently dominant crystalline silicon technology, for which no real bottlenecks exist. Indium and gallium for energy efficient lighting Indium and gallium are important materials for the manufacturing of light emitting diodes (LEDs). LEDs will become the dominant technology for energy efficient lighting in the following decades (McKinsey, 2011). Material demand for indium and gallium in LEDs was calculated using:  the total floor surface area of buildings in 2050 (square meters), taken from The Energy Report (TER) scenario  the amount of LEDs per square meter (1 LED per square meter has been assumed)  the material demand per LED, taken from a Fraunhofer study on resources for future technologies (Fraunhofer, 2007) whereby the material demand for a high performance WLED (White LED), an efficient LED type, was taken by Ecofys as the primary source of energy efficient lighting up to 2050. Maximum annual material for energy efficient lighting (LEDs) in tonnes Production 2011 Cummulative material for energy efficient lighting (LEDs) in tonnes Production 2011 (tonnes)  Even though the demand for LEDs is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades, Figure 3 shows that the indium and gallium demand per LED is so small that the maximum annual material demand is insignificant compared to production in 2011. As shown in Figure 4, the cumulative material demand for energy efficient lighting for indium is several magnitudes smaller than production in 2011 and for gallium this is about equal. It should be noted that this cumulative demand is spread out over about 40 years. The comparison with production, instead of with reserves and resources has been made, because figures on reserves and resources are not available for indium and gallium. Key mitigation measures  The development of liquid crystals from organic compounds could become substitutes for indium and gallium in LEDs, although the adjustments of colours might still require indium.  If, in the unlikely event, materials for LEDs become scarce, energy efficient fluorescent lighting could be used as a substitute for LEDs. Fluorescent lighting requires rare earths, however (JRC, 2011).  The paragraph on indium and gallium in photovoltaics explains further options for expanding supply and recycling and substitution for indium and gallium. Conclusion Even though our assumptions on the material demand for LEDs is uncertain, it is clear from the results that neither indium nor gallium is likely to become a bottleneck for the production of LEDs. In the unlikely scenario that this would be the case, substitution by other materials and the development of organic LEDs will alleviate the problem. Rare earths for wind turbines (neodymium and yttrium) Rare earths are used in a number of technologies from The Energy Report (TER) scenario, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles (magnets and batteries) and energy efficient lighting. The supply constraints of rare earths for wind energy are frequently mentioned in studies on critical materials for renewable energy and are therefore selected for a detailed analysis in this study. This requires calculating the maximum annual material demand for wind turbines and the cumulative material demands for wind turbines and comparing them with current production, reserves and resources. Offshore turbines must be able to withstand harsh conditions at sea, such as stronger winds and a salty environment, compared to onshore wind turbines. Page 34 | Critical Materials for the Transition to a 100% Sustainable Energy Future   rare earths are one of the most important bottlenecks for wind turbines  In addition, maintenance for offshore turbines is more difficult than maintenance for onshore turbines. For these reasons, offshore turbines may profit more from direct drive and superconductivity, which are less prone to technical failures and require less frequent maintenance. Since onshore turbines do not suffer from harsh environments and costly maintenance, it has been assumed that onshore wind turbines consist of conventional gearbox turbines, which do not require rare earths. Onshore wind turbines are therefore excluded from this analysis. In the future, if costs for direct drive and superconductive turbines are less prohibitive, onshore wind turbines could also benefit from this technology. This is, however, not included in this analysis. In addition, if serious material constraints would occur, the current technology (without direct drive and use of superconductivity turbines) can be used to avoid these constraints. Direct drive and superconductive turbines require the rare earth elements neodymium and yttrium, respectively, and are therefore included in this analysis. The share of direct drive turbines in 2050 is assumed to be 90% and the share of super conductive turbines is assumed to be 10%. Estimates on the material intensity of neodymium and yttrium for direct drive and superconducting wind turbines have been taken from Fraunhofer (2009). Just as with solar energy, a progress ratio of 85% is assumed. It should be noted that reliable information on rare earths is difficult to obtain (APS, 2011). Information on yttrium is available as a separate entry in the USGS commodities summary. Neodymium, however, only appears as part of the rare earths group. Production statistics for neodymium for 2010 have been obtained from DOE (2010). The reserves of neodymium are assumed to be equal to the reserves of rare earths. For neodymium and yttrium as well as for rare earths in general, information on resources is not available. Analysis of rare earths in wind turbines In 2050, the TER scenario assumes that 5% of global electricity production comes from off-shore wind turbines. With an estimated annual electricity production of 127 EJ, this means that around 6.4 EJ is produced by off-shore wind turbines annually. Based on this figure, assumptions have been made for the annual growth of offshore wind turbines and the total capacity of turbines required to produce this electricity in 2050. Using these data, the maximum annual material demand has been calculated. The cumulative material demand for offshore wind turbines has also been determined. This has been compared with figures for production, reserves and resources in 2050, see Figure 5 and Figure 6. Even if offshore wind energy supply is higher, such as around 10-20 EJ eventually by 2050, constraints for both elements, neodymium and yttrium, are unlikely.  As can be seen in Figure 5, the maximum yearly demand of neodymium and yttrium for wind technologies is a lot lower than the current production of neodymium and yttrium. Furthermore, Figure 6 shows that the cumulative demand for neodymium and yttrium required for offshore wind turbines is a lot smaller than reserves in Page 36 | Critical Materials for the Transition to a 100% Sustainable Energy Future   2011. Additional demand due to wind turbines is so small that it hardly shows up in the figure. This means that, even though demand growth for rare earths due to requirements for other applications is expected to rise sharply in the next five to ten years, rare earths will most likely not be a bottleneck for the implementation of wind energy in TER. (JRC, 2011)  The reason that these rare earths are considered a bottleneck is not because the quantities of the material are not enough to meet demand, but for other, geopolitical reasons. The main reason is that the majority of production is concentrated in a single country, namely China (APS, 2011). In recent years, rare earths have been the subject of export restrictions, which has given rise to concerns in for instance Japan, the United States and Europe. Eliminating these geopolitical constraints on the short term is difficult.  2030 The maximum annual material demand for lithium and cobalt occurs in 20In some cases, rare earths elements are the by-products of iron, zirconium, tin, thorium, or uranium production (APS, 2011). Projects to expand rare earth production are underway, but opening new mines requires large investments and time and almost a decade goes by before they are up and running. This means that even though reserves are more than enough to accommodate demand until 2050, increasing supply on the short run might be difficult. In addition, the exploitation of rare earth reserves can lead to severe environmental problems, which makes it difficult to open new mines in areas with strict environmental regulations. Key mitigation measures  Recycling of rare earths from pre-consumer magnets requires further research. Recycling from post-consumer waste, such as rare earths found in hard-drives is a possibility, although it can take some time before significant quantities enter the waste stream.   The substitution of rare earths used in permanent magnets, which are used in wind turbines, is difficult and has a negative effect on performance. Using other types of wind turbines, such as those using conventional gearboxes, however, can be a solution to eventual remaining bottlenecks (JRC, 2011).  Conclusion  The material demand for wind turbines is so small compared to annual production and reserves and resources that no supply bottlenecks are expected. In addition, it is possible to use conventional gearboxes instead of permanent magnets.  Cobalt and lithium for high density batteries The Energy Report (TER) scenario assumes a complete shift to plug-in hybrids and/ or electric vehicles for light duty vehicles. Light duty vehicles include personal two-wheelers, city cars and non-city cars. It is assumed that these vehicles will each have a battery that contains lithium and cobalt. In 2050, the TER scenario contains close to 3.3 billion light-duty vehicles.    Skutterudite is mined as an ore of cobalt and nickel with a byproduct of arsenic.  For these calculations, it is assumed that the batteries for light duty vehicles in the TER scenario will be the same as for plug in hybrid vehicles as presented in DOE (2010). The vehicles in the DOE report have a range of 40 miles (64 kilometres). The DOE provides a high and a low figure for the amounts of lithium and cobalt contained in these batteries. The high figure for lithium in batteries is 5.07 kg and the low figure is 1.35 kg. For cobalt this is 3.77 and 0 kg respectively. In order to calculate the material demand, the average of these low and the high figures have been used. This makes the amount of lithium and cobalt in a battery 3.2 and 1.9 kg, respectively. In a study on batteries from 2010, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has estimated the cost developments of batteries from 2010 to 2020. Almost all of the cost reduction comes from increased production volumes, which are economy of scale effects. In contrast, almost no cost reductions are expected from production-volumeindependent costs, which mainly consist of material costs. From this information it can be deduced that the material demand per battery is not expected to decrease much over time. For this reason, no technological learning has been taken into account for batteries. The fact that `limited' material learning will occur is not unexpected. For batteries, the capacity is to a large extent determined by the amount of active materials. This means that material use cannot be reduced substantially without reducing battery capacities. For each 5 year period from 2000 to 2050, TER contains figures for the amount of new light duty vehicles. The amount of new vehicles per period is multiplied by the material intensity of that period to arrive at total material demand for that period. The sum of these amounts is the total material demand for batteries in new electric and hybrid vehicles from 2000 until 2050. The maximum annual material demand for lithium and cobalt occurs in 2030. These figures are compared to current production of lithium and cobalt and shown in Figure 7. The cumulative material demand for lithium and cobalt is compared to current reserves and resources and shown in Figure 8. The results presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 have been calculated without taking into account the limited lifetime of batteries for electric vehicles. This means that the actual amount of batteries required for vehicles from 2000 until 2050 in the TER scenario is likely to be higher than shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8. It is difficult to include the lifetime of batteries in these calculations, because very little information is available on this issue, due to limited hands on experience with electric vehicles. Another complicating factor is the fact that the lifetime is largely dependent on the usage of the battery, such as kilometres driven and how it is charged. A lot of research is being poured into the development of more efficient and durable batteries.  Figure 7 shows that current production levels of lithium and cobalt are not sufficient to meet the yearly peak material demand for batteries in the TER report. Especially for lithium the difference is large. In addition, Figure 8 shows that expected material requirements for both materials are large compared to reserves and resources. If   the limited lifetime of batteries would be taken into account, this shortage would be even more pronounced. Also, if more than the assumed 3.3 billion electric vehicles are on the road eventually or in case electrification expands into other transport areas in the future such as freight vehicles and/or aviation and shipping there may be further shortages. However, reductions in material intensity for batteries used in the calculations is conservative compared to the estimates made for wind and solar. Current lithium production mainly takes place in Chile, Australia, China and Argentina. Lithium batteries power the majority of cell phones and laptops. Demand for lithium has grown continuously over the last ten years and is expected to continue growing by 5 to 10% annually during the next decade. Therefore, recycling of lithium is a key issue. Cobalt is usually produced as a by-product of the production of other metals, such as copper or nickel. It is primarily produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Australia and Cuba. Instability in the DRC could lead to short term supply bottlenecks. The majority of cobalt is refined in China, making cobalt subject to the same insecurities as rare earths. In addition to batteries, cobalt is also used in superalloys, cutting tools and catalysts. Additional demand for these applications could put additional strain on the availability of cobalt for batteries. UNEP reports moderate expected growth rates for cobalt (UNEP, 2011). Key mitigation measures Lithium  At this moment lithium prices are not high enough to make recycling profitable. Expected price increases, technological developments and legal measures making battery recycling compulsory, could result in higher recycling rates for lithium (UNEP, 2009).  Substitution of lithium for other materials in the non-energy sector, which is at present still substantial, is often possible. This could free up additional lithium for batteries (UNIA, 2011). Cobalt  On a positive note, a switch in materials to less cobalt intensive cathodes for batteries could greatly reduce the demand for cobalt in the future.  Although at present not as effective as cobalt containing batteries, substituting lithium batteries containing cobalt for those that do not contain cobalt could circumvent bottlenecks (BCG, 2010).  Recycling, which is already taking place in for instance rechargeable batteries, can be expanded without a lot of effort. Current recycling rates are at 25% (UNIA, 2011). Conclusion The large material demand for cobalt and lithium compared with annual production and reserves and resources indicates that these materials might become a bottleneck for a fully sustainable energy system as represented in The Energy Report (TER). Copper for infrastructure, energy supply and energy efficient electric motors Copper is one of the most widely used metals on earth. In addition to usage in roofing, plumbing and industrial machinery, it is used primarily in electrical wires (USGS, 2011). Copper is used for long and short distance electricity transport and distribution, e.g. from the power plant to the consumer. In addition, copper is used in many of the renewable energy supply technologies in The Energy Report (TER), such as transformers in wind turbines and in solar energy. Copper is also used in electric motors. In general, more efficient electric motors require more copper. A key aspect of TER is the large expansion of supply-driven renewable energy sources; wind energy, solar photovoltaics and wave energy. To accommodate the integration of a large share of these variable renewables, there are several options. Expansion of the electricity infrastructure is one of them, as it provides more flexibility to match supply and demand on a continental scale. Even though copper has not been highlighted as a critical metal by many of the critical material studies, the combined projected increase in copper demand as a result of several of the technologies included in the TER scenario could make it a bottleneck after all. In order to determine whether this is the case, the maximum and total copper demand for solar and wind energy over the years was calculated, as well as the copper required for energy efficient electric motors and copper attributed to the expansion of infrastructure:  For solar energy, it was assumed that the 37 EJ electricity production in 2050 attributed to photovoltaics is met by a mix of 60% crystalline PV and 40% thin film PV. Copper requirements for concentrating solar power (CSP), which is expected to have an annual electricity production of 21.6 EJ by 2050, is also taken into account. For wind energy, copper demands for both onand offshore wind turbines were taken into account, with an expected annual electricity production of 25.3 and 6.7 EJ respectively. For each of these technologies, assumptions were made on the annual growth in capacity and the associated copper demand. The peak in copper demand for energy production technologies is expected to occur in 2045.  In order to calculate the additional copper requirements for energy efficient electric motors, figures on the electricity consumed by electric motors in 2006 were extrapolated to 2050 using the expected GDP growth as presented in TER (IEA, 2011, p. 39). The electricity consumption in 2050 was used to calculate installed capacity in 2050. It was assumed that copper requirements for current electric motors (class IE2) are 1000 ton per GW installed capacity. It was also assumed that by 2050, all electric motors are of the IE3 class and energy efficient electric motors are of the IE4 class. It was assumed that for each improvement in efficiency class, roughly 1.2 times more copper is required (Ecofys Estimate), 2012). By assuming a lifetime of 20 years for electric motors, the annual copper requirements for energy efficient electrical motors in 2050 have been calculated (IEA, 2011).  The annual copper demand for an expansion of existing electricity infrastructure to accommodate renewable energy sources was calculated  taking the approach described in Appendix A. Note that these calculations used conservative assumptions, resulting most likely in an overestimate of copper demand for infrastructure.  Figure 9 shows that the combined additional copper demand due to the expansion of the electricity infrastructure, solar and wind energy and energy efficient electrical motors is small compared to copper production in 2011. Figure 10 shows that cumulative copper demand for these developments until 2050 is marginal compared with reserves and resources in 2011. These results show that from a technical point of view, copper will most likely not be a bottleneck for a fully sustainable energy system as represented in The Energy Report (TER). However, an increase in copper demand, also due to technologies not included in the TER, will lead to companies expanding production by using lower quality ores. This leads to increased energy requirements for copper production and increased copper prices (Harmsen, 2011). Key mitigation measures  Recycling of copper from old infrastructure and other applications is possible, although it is hindered by the sometimes long use phase of copper and the different waste flows that contain copper, often ending up in landfills. In addition, copper is often only a small part of the host product and it is difficult or inefficient to recycle copper from alloys. For these reasons, Harmsen claims that it is difficult to expect a very high recycling rate (Harmsen, 2011).  In many applications, copper can be substituted for other materials. Examples are plastics in tubing and glass fiber in telecommunication. For the technologies examined in this chapter, aluminium is the most likely candidate for substitution. Aluminium is a good material to use for electricity infrastructure, although the lower density of aluminium would lead to wires with a larger diameter. For electrical motors, the lower density of aluminium could result in    performance loss. It is important to keep in mind that even though aluminium is more abundant than copper, it requires more energy to produce (Harmsen, 2011). Conclusion In spite of the many different applications of copper in a fully sustainable energy system as represented in TER, demand is still low compared with supply in 2011 and reserves and resources. Reducing demand through substitution and increasing supply by recycling further reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of a bottleneck. Semiconductors for smart electronics Semiconductors are important components in electrical and electronic equipment including cell phones, personal computers, automotive electronics, LEDs and solar cells. Accordingly, the production volumes for these components have increased in recent decades and are expected to continue to increase up to 2050. For power electronics, which have been mentioned in chapter 3, it has been difficult to find information on the materials involved in their production and the development of demand for power electronics in the future. For lack of information, they have been excluded from further analysis. Semiconductors are an integral part of improving energy efficiency in the built environment as well as in industry and transport. Electronics containing semiconductors are required, for instance, to regulate temperature in buildings and optimise production processes in manufacturing plants. Semiconductors are hence an important aspect in The Energy Report (TER) scenario and it is worthwhile to assess the possibilities for bottlenecks in the supply of semiconductors for the TER scenario. However, it is difficult to quantify the expected increase in the global demand for semiconductors and, in particular, which share to attribute to developments in the TER scenario versus other demand sectors. In addition, many different types of semiconductors exist, consisting of many different materials, including arsenic, germanium, indium, gallium, rhenium, silicon and tellurium (USGS, 2011 and UNIA, 2011). It is worth noting that the supply of a number of these materials, such as gallium, indium and tellurium, may already be strained by the introduction of other technologies in the TER scenario, such as photovoltaics. Many materials required for the production of semiconductors can be substituted with other materials, although these are often also scarce. In addition, since these materials are used for other applications, it may be possible to reduce their usage in these other applications to free up materials for the production of semiconductors when supplies become tight. All these different factors make it a difficult and time-intensive task to quantitatively assess whether any material bottlenecks for semiconductors are likely to occur in the TER scenario. It would require an in depth assessment of all the different materials involved in the production of semiconductors, their production forecasts, competing demand sectors and mitigation measures such as recycling and substitution. While this analysis is outside the scope of this project, additional research in this area would provide worthwhile insights if undertaken.  The Energy Report (TER) tries to limit the use of biomass for energy purposes. When other renewable energy sources are not feasible, TER resorts to biomass. For example, biomass is assumed as the fuel source for trucks, planes and ships, for which it is presently difficult to switch from fossil fuels to electric energy sources. Biomass is also used for industrial processes, where very high temperatures are required. The TER scenario conservatively assumes that it will be necessary to obtain biomass from sustainably grown biofuel crops and from sustainable forest management, even though a portion of biomass demand can be met using waste streams. Care is taken not to threaten food and water supplies and biodiversity and to prevent CO2 emissions. The need to grow additional biomass for biofuels, albeit as sustainably as possible, raises the issue of potentially increased demand for artificial fertilisers. The most important components of fertilisers, also mentioned in TER, are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. The TER scenario considers a closed loop approach in order to minimise the need for fertiliser. This includes precision farming, minimising losses to the environment and recycling nutrients from residue and waste streams. It is, however, likely that at least some additional demand for fertilisers will be caused by the increased production of crops for biofuels Since atmospheric nitrogen is freely available for nitrogen fixation on a global level, nitrogen is not expected to be a bottleneck for the production of fertilisers. However, phosphorus and potassium have to be mined from phosphate rock and potash. For phosphate rock, world resources exceed 300 billion tonnes (USGS, 2012). Global reserves are estimated to be 71 billion tonnes. With an estimated production of 0.191 billion tonnes in 2011, phosphate reserves and resources are able to meet demand far beyond 2050, even if demand grows significantly. For potash, world resources and reserves total 250 and 9.5 billion tonnes respectively. With an annual production in 2011 of 37 million tonnes, a large increase in demand should be easily accommodated within existing resources (USGS, 2012). Since all three key components of artificial fertilisers are readily available and production is spread out over many countries with a broad geological spread, materials required for the production of fertilisers are not expected to become bottlenecks for achieving the TER scenario.    5. Comparison Material Demand TER Scenario and NP Scenario    As discussed in chapter 4, a fully Comparison Material sustainable energy scenario like The Energy Demand TER Scenario Report (TER) will lead to additional and np Scenario material demand for some materials. However, a development of society as described in TER also has certain benefits in terms of material use. This chapter will qualitatively assess the key differences in material demand between the TER scenario and a conventional ambitious scenario, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) New Policy Scenario (NPS), the business as usual scenario. The NPS is the most central scenario for forecasts from the IEA and is commonly used as a basis for energy market studies. Although the NPS only runs until 2035, the comparison has been made based on the information which is available. Material requirements to achieve the TER scenario and NPS Both the TER scenario and NPS require increasing amounts of materials including critical materials. However, due to the different technology types deployed, there are important differences in the types of critical materials required. The most critical bottlenecks in a transition to the TER scenario are:  lithium and cobalt for electric vehicles. As detailed in Chapter 4, other materials, such as rare earths for wind turbines and copper for wind and solar energy, energy efficient motors and a more elaborate electricity infrastructure, are less likely to be bottlenecks. Indium, gallium and tellurium are not considered an important bottleneck, because their use in photovoltaics can be substituted by using technologies using less critical materials, such as silicon. Material supply bottlenecks illustrate the importance of an early material strategy. Whether or not a technology is prone to suffer from supply chain bottlenecks should be taken into consideration when making an investment decision or making R&D decisions. In these cases, technologies that rely on abundant materials have an advantage over technologies that rely on critical materials.  A continued reliance on conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy in the NPS means an increased demand for materials used in the fossil fuels and nuclear industries. For example, the IEA estimates that in 2035 the share of fossil fuels in global primary energy consumption is 75% and the output of nuclear energy rises by 70% over the period to 2035 (IEA, 2011). Although only playing a role at the end of the 2035 period, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is important due to the continued reliance on fossil fuels, and would be expected to play an increasingly important role up to 2050. Examples of critical materials which will experience increased demand can be found in the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2012 (USGS, 2012):   the usage of bromine in flue gas scrubbers in power plants   barite, beryllium and cesium in oil and gas well drilling fluids   rare earth chlorides for the production of fluid-cracking catalysts in oil refineries  The mineral bismuth is used for liquid coolants   barite for high-density concrete for radiation shielding  bismuth for liquid coolants   hafnium and indium for nuclear reactor control rod alloys   materials required for CCS include chemicals for the capture installations, materials for pipelines and for drilling platforms  Many of the material bottlenecks for the TER scenario are not relevant for the NPS. A reduced capacity of photovoltaics as compared with the TER scenario means a smaller likelihood of an indium, gallium or tellurium bottleneck. Continued reliance on oil as the basis for transportation fuels (since electric vehicles are not considered commercially viable and the potential for substitution of oil in transport is considered limited) mean significantly less electric vehicles as compared to the TER scenario and hence a reduced likelihood of lithium or cobalt (for batteries) becoming a bottleneck.  However, many of the material bottlenecks for the NPS are also not relevant for the TER scenario. Fossil fuels in the energy mix will meet only 5% of total energy supply in 2050, hence fossil fuel scarcities will not arise in the TER scenario. In addition, since TER excludes CCS and nuclear energy by 2050, these bottlenecks will neither be relevant for TER scenario.    In the TER scenario higher material efficiency, for example in the building of vehicles with lighter steel frames is assumed.   The importance of energy efficiency and material efficiency in the TER scenario and NPS An important part of the TER scenario is the far reaching development in efficiency, which is expected to occur in all sectors of society, ranging from transportation, to the built environment and to industry. The NPS also states that efficiency measures will affect energy consumption, but at a much smaller scale than in the TER scenario. As a result, both scenarios have very different predictions about energy consumption in the future. The TER scenario will not only assume a higher energy efficiency, but also a higher material efficiency. An example from TER is building cars with lighter frames, leading to lower steel demand per vehicle. There are many options to reduce demand for primary materials, such as product recycling, material recycling and more efficient product design (Allwood et al., 2011. Worrell et al., 1997). Conclusion The most important developments affecting the differences in material demand between the TER scenario and the NPS are the share of renewable energy and fossil fuels, energy efficiency measures, material efficiency measures and energy consumption. Although some of the material bottlenecks for the TER scenario are larger than those in the NPS, energy efficiency measures, an increase in material efficiency, the absence of nuclear energy and a significantly reduced reliance on fossil fuels will most likely lead to a smaller overall demand in scarce resources than in the NPS.

WWF-2015-3.txt,"ROAD THROUGH PARIS 2015 WWF POLICY ASKS FOR PARIS UNFCCC COP21 NOVEMBER 2015 Introduction The global movement for a fair and just energy transition away from fossil fuels is growing. Investments into solar and wind energy are rising rapidly in many countries, rich and poor alike, and we see a growing drive to divest from fossil fuels, particularly coal, the single largest cause of climate change. The continued decline in costs of renewable energy and the significant economic energy saving potentials leave little excuse for inaction. In addition, the September 2015 agreement on Sustainable Development Goals, if fully implemented, would pave the way for more just and clean economic development and environmental protection up to 2030. WWF, with the global CSO community, large faith groups, trade unions and progressive business demand nothing less from Paris than a clear signal that the energy transition is underway and irreversible and that we are on a path consistent with keeping global warming within levels that can prevent catastrophic climate change. The UNFCCC could deliver such an agreement if governments showed true political will. In Paris all of 195 Parties must act responsibly by putting in place an agreement that speeds up the global transformation towards zero-carbon economies and climate resilience while also supporting the millions of vulnerable people and ecosystems that already bearing the unavoidable impacts of climate change. For this to be achieved the Paris agreement must deliver a strong, fair and transformational outcome consisting of the following: 1. A sense that the direction we are moving towards is a fair and science-based trajectory 2. An international climate architecture that ensures climate actions will become increasingly stronger 3. Ensures the security and resilience of the vulnerable 4. Provision of a solid resourcing foundation © elxeneize / shutterstock.com  5-YEAR CYCLES OF PROGRESSIVELY MORE AMBITIOUS NATIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS A Fair And Transformational Paris Outcome 1. A sense that the direction we are moving towards is a fair and science- based trajectory 1.1. An “Ambition Mechanism” to address the pre- and post-2020 emissions gaps In order to limit warming to below 1.5 or even 2°C, experts call for global emissions to peak before 2020 and decline rapidly thereafter. While the Cancun pledges, and recent submissions of INDCs help bend the emissions curve they do not put us on this trajectory. By 1 October 2015 146 countries covering 87% of global greenhouse gas emissions had submitted INDCsi. This reflects a new level of political commitment around the world to address climate change and to collectively start bending the global emissions curve, but much more is needed to close the emissions gap created by these INDCs in order to be consistent with keeping warming below 1.5 or 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Estimates put the emissions gap at 8-10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2eq) by 2020ii and up to 15 Gt CO2eq by 2030iii. The INDCs submitted so far only address around half of the reductions required and should be seen as a floor for further and stronger national action. Multilateral cooperation within a strong international framework is required and it is vital that Parties deliver agreements in Paris that directly addresses the pre-2020iv and post-2020v, vi ambition gaps while also ensuring that adaption and finance ambition will be increased over time. The risk of a likely ‘bottom up’ nature of the Paris outcome, where countries offer commitments based on purely their “national circumstance” and with little or no consideration to the requirements of science or equity, will virtually guarantee an emissions gap and an unfair sharing of effort for decades to come. Although the Paris outcome won’t be able to fully close these gaps, countries cannot ignore them or simply leave the problem to future governments. Instead, the Paris outcome needs to explicitly create processes that will promote action that goes beyond existing INDCs. The following elements would form an important 3-part plan to address the emissions gap: 1. Cooperative efforts by Parties to Address the Gap: All parties should agree to take steps beyond their unconditional INDCs to cut the post-2020 emissions gap by half or more before 2025 and close it entirely soon thereafter. Developed country parties, and others willing to do so, should make quantified pledges of support (expressed in terms of finance or a target of emissions reductions) to developing countries to satisfy their conditional targets and take other steps to help meet this 2025 goal. 2. Permanent Action Agenda: The Lima-Paris Action Agenda has provided an important spotlight on the need for near-term action and encourages new cooperation among non-state actors and governments. The Paris outcome should develop a permanent high-level action agenda, led by prominent champions that incentivizes and tracks progress on new, transformative cooperative actions between governments and among non-state actors and governments. 3. Enhanced Technical Examination Process (TEP): The existing technical examination process under ADP Workstream 2 has helped engage experts and catalyse new ideas. But the process has not been given the political attention and resources needed to become transformative. The Paris outcome should link the TEP to the action agenda and key mechanisms of the convention including the Green Climate Fund. In addition to these three steps to begin to immediately address the gap, countries should build the new climate regime around regular 5-year cycles of progressively more ambitious national contributions informed by science and equity reviews (see the next section of this paper). To implement this plan to address the emissions gap, WWF proposes that the Workstream 2 decisions in Paris should: 1. Strongly call for developed countries to take additional action to close the pre-2020 gap, and for developing countries without mitigation pledges to submit one. Developing countries with existing pledges should also increase their efforts, where possible, with additional support. 2. Include clear commitments to address the emissions gap including: o All Parties commit to cooperate with each other to ensure that any remaining emissions reduction gap is closed o Developed countries, and others willing to do so, jointly pledge to provide adequate support to developing countries to cooperatively achieve large emissions reductions before 2020 while in the post- 2020 period these pledges should help achieve reductions beyond developing country’s unconditional INDCs. 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2050 Individual developed countries commit to quantified pledges of support to developing countries (in the form of finance or expressed in tonnes of emissions to be reduced) that reflect the developed country’s fair share of the joint goal to cooperatively eliminate the emissions gap. The new Agreement should capture this mode of work as part of the mechanisms to address the gap in the post-2020 period 3. Create formalised annual opportunities for Parties, particularly developed countries, to announced enhanced and accelerated action that goes beyond existing efforts, including scaling up targets or over-achieving them. 4. Establish a permanent Action Agenda to develop and launch new actions and report back on previously launched initiatives. The Action Agenda should be led by high-level champions or facilitators and linked to the technical examination process. 5. Establish clear social and environmental principles and criteria for the inclusion of initiatives in the action agenda. 6. Decide to enhance and continue the collaborative technical examination process (TEP) until the ambition gap is closed, including through clear guidance to the finance and technology mechanisms to support new initiatives that are developed under that process, particularly in areas with large mitigation potential and numerous co-benefits such as renewable energy, energy efficiency and land use. 7. Finally, recognizing the shortfall in mitigation ambition and growing adaptation needs, the WS2 Decision should introduce a technical examination process on adaptation. While it is unlikely that Parties will be able to agree to all the components of an Ambition Mechanism in Paris, the agreement/s needs to set the foundations for a collaborative approach to addressing the emissions gap and incentivising these enhanced actions. 1.2. A strong long-term goal for 2050, in line with keeping warming below 1.5°C underpinned by the inclusion of mid-term targets for 2025 and 2030 The Paris Agreement needs to provide a clear signal, through a commitment to a long-term goal, that we are in a just transition towards a zero carbon future. This long-term goal should also signal that continued investments into fossil fuels, infrastructure and exploration, will be economically risky and lead to stranded investments. These signals can be captured in a long-term goal that caps emissions in line with the carbon budget outlined in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for keeping warming below 1.5°C vii, viii, ix. Agreement on a global carbon budget consistent with the temperature goal enables Parties to more readily identify and address the emissions gap and it should go hand in hand with a global GHG emission reduction target for 2050, consistent with keeping warming below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. To make these goals concrete, it should include the aim of phasing out all fossil fuels and phasing in 100% renewable energy by 2050. These 2050 goals should be underpinned by 2030 goals for sourcing 45% of all primary energy from renewable sources by 2030 and ramping up global energy intensity improvements to 4.5% annually. In addition to ambitious action in these sectors, countries must express their collective commitment to halt deforestation by 2030. All goals should be based on the common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities of countries. Such a trajectory of both long and mid-term goals would deliver a clear signal that there is no future for investment in unsustainable energy sources or in the conversion of natural forests to other uses. 2. An international climate regime that ensures climate actions will become increasingly ambitious over time 2.1. A Strong International framework and agreed guidelines to inform countries’ national contributions The submissions of national contributions by countries should be comprehensive and include mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation. The agreement should ensure provide confidence that Parties will implement promised efforts but there should be flexibility to strengthened these in terms of coverage and ambition over time. These commitments should be based on five year periods INDCS SHOULD BE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY TO ENSURE THAT ADAPTATION EFFORTS AND ADAPTATION SUPPORT NEEDS ARE INCREASED IN LINE WITH PROJECTED CLIMATE IMPACTS and must recognise varying levels of responsibility and capability in terms of form and ambition. It should be clear that all Parties, as they reach higher levels of capability, should eventually move to clear cumulative emission targets for five year periods. When these commitments are updated every five years, they must clearly go beyond earlier efforts. Irrespective of the placement of those commitments, there has to be an assurance in the agreement that Parties “nationally determined” mitigation commitments have legal force. Developed countries and others with similarly high responsibility and capability should clearly indicate the emissions reductions that they will achieve. Parties with high responsibility and capability that cannot meet their full fair share of emission reductions domestically should also indicate how much emission reduction they will achieve beyond their own borders through setting targets for support to developing countries, either in terms of finance or a target of emissions reductions. Other developing countries should indicate the climate action they will take with their own resources as well as indicate what support is needed to enable additional actions. With regard to the forest and land sector the Paris agreement should adopt a simple, flexible and transparent approach, which promotes high ambition and environmental integrity. Parties must recognize that actions in the forest and land sector are crucial to keep global warming below 1.5° C and include the land sector comprehensively in their nationally determined contributions. Parties must also promote mitigation and adaptation actions in the forest and land sectors, including through REDD+, to help close the ambition gap before 2020; In recognition of the fact that climate change impacts vulnerable communities everywhere, all parties should also present intended nationally determined adaptation contributions to the UNFCCC. These INDCs should be reviewed periodically to ensure that adaptation efforts and adaptation support needs (finance, technology and capacity-building) are increased in line with projected climate impacts due to increased temperatures. 2.2. Rules to enhance transparency & comparability Transparency is needed to both understand what countries are offering in their INDCs and to track progress of mitigation, adaptation and delivery of finance. Transparency facilitates understanding of Party commitments, helps to build trust in the international climate change framework, ensures that governments can be held accountable for their actions and tracks whether sufficient action is being taken to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fully disclosing information of what the atmosphere sees from country-specific mitigation actions and support, along with internationally consistent and clear rules for monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) must be included in new agreement(s) in Paris. The post-2020 climate framework should build on the existing MRV framework, extend the scope beyond mitigation, and allow flexibility for countries (particularly LDCs and SIDS) while they build their capability. It should provide methodological guidelines and create opportunities to review the efficacy of the MRV system in future. The Agreement should include a formalized transparency framework that defines common principles, applicable to all Parties, for monitoring, reporting and verification of the implementation of national mitigation action and the provision of support. The Agreement needs to include provisions to secure the principles of environmental integrity and that there is no double-counting of efforts within the transparency framework. Transparent and comparable accounting is also relevant in the land sector where additional complexities of the interaction of human activity and natural processes, and the fact that the land sector can be both a source of emissions as well as a sink. There also needs to be a harmonization of land-based accounting rules. 2.3. Regular ambition & equity reviews with clear mechanisms to increase emissions reduction targets and support and match additional support with ambitious conditional targets. The Paris agreement must establish a regular five year process for Parties, supported by experts and civil society, to review intended national emission reduction targets and available means of implementation against the global carbon budget and an agreed equity reference framework. The review has to be done at both global and individual country levels and Parties should be urged to ramp up their pledges based on this review. As part of the review process parties should address the mobilisation of support to achieve the additional emission reduction potential identified through conditional targets. This review mechanism should start no later than 2018 to have a chance to impact the targets put forward in current INDCs. 3. Ensuring the security and resilience of the vulnerable 3.1. The establishment of a Global Adaptation Goal The Paris agreement must establish a global goal for adaptation to adequately address adaptation needs and treat it at same level of priority as mitigation in the international framework. Such an Adaptation Goal should be both qualitative such as “to build resilience to climate change impacts and protect vulnerable people and ecosystems” and concrete through setting clear objectives for adaptation finance, institutional frameworks, and adaptation readiness. 3.2. Adequate public financing for adaptation Adaptation finance should be sufficient to meet the needs of those countries that are most vulnerable to climate change yet have the least responsibility for causing the problem and the least capability to deal with the challenges. A major adaptation funding gap for the pre-2020 period already exists, and this gap will grow in the post-2020 period unless new and additional finance for adaptation is made available. According to UNEPx the funding required for adaptation in developing countries in already unsafe 2oC warming scenarios is to the order of USD 150 billion per year by 2030 and USD 250-500 billion per year by 2050. Therefore the Paris Agreement has a critical role to play to ensure that sufficient adaptation finance is made available. This finance should take the form of new, additional, predictable and sustainable commitments from mainly public sources. 3.3. Loss and damage as a central provision in the Agreement The issue of loss and damage should be strongly and fairly captured as a stand-alone provision in the Paris Agreement in recognition of the fact that irreversible loss and damage due to climate change will increase where adaptation and mitigation can no longer curb the most severe impacts of climate change. Even with strong mitigation and adaptation support there will be residual losses and damage as a result of emissions that are already in the atmosphere, and will impact highly vulnerable places and people such as in low lying Island nations, mountainous regions, among others. Therefore, loss and damage should be treated distinctly from adaptation and the Paris Agreement should establish a separate and robust international mechanism on loss and damage. 4. A solid resourcing foundation First and foremost developed countries must deliver the pledged USD100 billion by 2020. This should include concrete pledges of additional finance in the run up to COP21 as well as a clear roadmap and commitments to scaling up to the promised level by 2020. Transfers and mobilization of predictable, new and additional public finance from multiple sources must remain a central element of the overall financing strategy and the post-2020 framework should ensure that finance contributions grow from the floor of USD100 billion per annum in 2020. However, the Paris Agreement should also reflect an expanded approach to climate finance that uses a range of instruments and commitments to shift large scale investments towards low-emissions renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency, building resilience as well as for activities in the forest and land sector, including REDD+. Is should specifically include predictable, new and additional funding for adaptation. Developed countries should continue to lead the way on finance contributions but other countries with similar levels responsibility and capability should step up, following the recent leadership of countries like China and Mexico. All other countries are welcome to contribute if they are willing to do so. Similar to the mitigation commitments, finance commitments should be reviewed and scaled up through the regular cycles of an ambition mechanism. Parties should also be strongly urged to create policy frameworks to mobilize the USD 2 trillion annually that is necessary in 15 to 20 years for the sufficient rollout of renewables and energy efficiency while also phasing out and removing the USD one trillion in fossil fuel investments. Parties also need to remove the staggering direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies that amount to up to 6.5% of global GDP (including climate and air pollution externalities). Though overall energy investments will be higher than at present, it will be cheaper overall when considering avoided externality costs. Policy processes linked to climate finance, should detail how countries will involve the private sector in climate mitigation and adaptation projects. Strengthening domestic industries within low-carbon sectors is vital, and will create the space for enhanced use of domestic resources for climate resilience, and sustainable development. 6 5. Equity in the post-2020 framework The Paris Agreement must embody an approach to equity and differentiation that is crosscutting and appropriate within each part of the agreement. In particular the approach to equity should recognise that parties have varying levels of responsibility and capability. The global temperature goal can only be met if developed countries, and those developing countries with similar responsibility and capability, complement their domestic efforts as part of their fair share, with support for poorer developing countries to transition to low carbon economies. The most appropriate basis for this is an equity reference framework with clear principles and criteria for sharing the global carbon budget and responsibilities for remaining within it in an equitable manner. Closing Remarks Many factors are aligning to create favourable circumstances for more ambition to address climate change. The 5th IPCC Assessment Report has reiterated that emissions must peak before 2020 and with renewable energy prices falling sharply there is every possibility that this can be achieved. The increasing incidence of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods, storms and droughts serve as reminders of what is at stake. While fossil fuel investments still totaled an estimated USD 1 trillion in 2014, they are increasingly considered to be high risk and investments in renewables (excluding large hydro) grew by 17% to more than USD 270 billion in 2014xvi. On top of the changing economics, people everywhere are mobilizing to call for much greater action. Ongoing struggles by frontline communities, events such as the largest ever climate march in New York in September 2014 and calls to action from faith leaders, including Pope Francis and Islamic Scholars emphasize how strong the moral, economic and scientific case for increased climate action is. Governments have to build on this momentum and give the world an agreement that gives us all hope for a better future. COP 21 in Paris can be an important milestone within the transition to a zero carbon society as it represents the most important global moment for multilateral climate action since COP15 in Copenhagen (2009). Leaders and governments have the opportunity to act responsibly and speed up the just transition to a decarbonized and climate resilient world. Paris will not be the end of the struggle against climate change and for a safe and better future, but with the right political will, it can be the turning of the tide.  "
WWF-2015-5.txt,"ANNUAL REVIEW INT 2015 together possible TM   Front cover © NASA WWF is one of the world's largest and most experienced independent conservation organizations, with over 5 million supporters and a global network active in more than 100 countries. WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which people live in harmony with nature, by conserving the world's biological diversity, ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable, and promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption. A WWF International production Written and edited by Barney Jeffries,  Design: Stéfane Mauris, WWF International Printed by NCP SA and Pressor SA, Switzerland The designation of geographical entities in this report, and the presentation of the material, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Published in April 2016 by WWF ­ World Wide Fund For Nature (Formerly World Wildlife Fund), Gland, Switzerland   In little more than a generation, Shenzhen has grown from a market town of 30,000 people to a megacity with a population of more than 18 million. Across the water, Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with 7.2 million inhabitants. Yet in between, the marshes, mudflats and mangroves of the Mai Po Nature Reserve, managed by WWF-Hong Kong, provide a haven for wildlife. More than 90,000 migratory birds from around 380 species pass through the reserve each year. As the global human population continues to grow and becomes increasingly urban, it's more important than ever to find ways for people and nature to thrive side by side. That, in a nutshell, is what WWF is here for.   Humanity's relationship with the planet is changing profoundly. We have entered the ""anthropocene"" ­ an era of humans driving planetary change. Last year was the hottest on record, with 2016 expected to be hotter still and global temperatures already 1°C above preindustrial levels.  Yolanda Kakabadse President WWF International  To prevent catastrophic climate change, we must transform our dirty fossil fuel economy to one based on clean renewable energy. And this is but one of the major challenges we face. We must transform global food systems to sustainably and equitably feed a growing population without further devastating our environment. We must ensure access to sufficient freshwater resources for people and nature, an issue identified by the World Economic Forum as the biggest threat to the global economy for three years running. In the face of unprecedented pressure on natural systems, we need to refocus and redouble our efforts to defend and enhance the value of our oceans, forests and wildlife for the future well-being of people.  ""Together with others, we will change the unsustainable course the world is on to build  Nature remains under huge pressure. But 2015 has provided hope as the entire world came together around the Sustainable Development Goals and forged an unprecedented agreement on climate. WWF has played a key role in these and many other successes. But we can do more. And we will. We are undergoing a significant change, building on our unique strengths, to evolve WWF to match our own ambitions. Together with others, we will change the unsustainable course the world is on to build a future in harmony with nature. Because we know that together...anything is possible!  a future in harmony  with nature.""   EXTRAORDINARY TIMES Marco Lambertini Director General WWF International ""There has never been a more exciting or challenging time for WWF, or indeed for the entire environmental movement.""  We are living in extraordinary times. Times of unprecedented risk but also unparalleled opportunity for the future of our planet and our society.  A time when the world's wildlife has been halved in less than a generation; oceans, rivers and forests are struggling to cope with our growing pressure upon them; and when we are still on a path toward catastrophic climate change impacts.  But this is also a time when the science is clearer than ever before. Awareness is at an all-time high, commitments are more ambitious.  2015 was a record year for investment in renewables and divestment from fossil fuels; a terrible year for the number of elephants and rhinos killed in Africa by poachers, but also a year when a historic UN resolution recognized wildlife crime and its impact on governance, security and sustainable development. And while the percentage of the ocean that is protected remains shamefully low, governments announced new marine protected areas covering millions of hectares.  And then we have the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that bring together the economic, social and environmental agendas like never before; the landmark Paris Agreement on climate where almost 200 governments, including all major emitters, committed to contain global warming; and a growing number of corporations committing to address climate change, assuming responsibility for using natural resources sustainably and greening their supply chains.  Hundreds of millions of people are using social media and are taking to the streets, making their voices heard about the future they want. The world has never been more conscious of the problems and solutions, or more committed to addressing them.  We have already entered a great transition  toward an ecologically sustainable and more  equitable future for all. The scale and pace of  this transition will define success or failure.  WWF can't miss this opportunity to capitalize  on the momentum.       This is why we are transforming the way we work. We need a 21st century WWF that more than ever is focused and obsessed with results, embraces innovation, engages in powerful and influential partnerships, and drives large-scale mobilization of people. We will put our efforts behind ambitious goals that will make a difference on a global scale, building on our solid foundation of conservation successes achieved over more than half a century, while leveraging our unique worldwide Network of locally rooted national organizations, our successful partnerships and collaborative projects, and the values and passion of our people. There has never been a more exciting or challenging time for WWF or indeed for the entire environmental movement. This is a unique opportunity to rebalance our relationship with the planet. It's an opportunity we have to take.  WWF: TAKING BOLD COLLECTIVE ACTION WWF has embarked on a journey of deep internal transformation that will make us stronger and more effective as we tackle the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead. The time to act is now. We are putting in place a global conservation strategy that reflects the way the world is changing, meets the big environmental challenges of the age and helps us simplify, unite and focus our efforts for greater impact. We will continue to deliver locally in crucial ecoregions around the world, but sharpen our focus on six global goals ­ on wildlife, forests, oceans, water, climate and energy, and food ­ and three key drivers of environmental degradation ­ markets, finance and governance. We are creating global communities of practice for each of the goals and drivers composed of specialists from WWF and key external partners. This will foster greater collaboration and innovation, incubating new ideas and taking promising ones to scale, as we unite our efforts toward making ambitious targets a reality. While continuing to focus on action and impact on the ground, we must think at the level of systems and devote our efforts to working with and influencing the institutions and corporations that matter in moving policy and practice toward sustainability. This will demand impact on the drivers of change at a scale that is beyond our current best efforts. We know that one organization alone can't effect the change needed. That's why the Practices are strongly inclusive of our partnerships with local and global institutions and corporations. The changes we want to see in the world can only come about through the efforts of many actors: local communities and multinational corporations, governments and NGOs, finance institutions and development agencies, consumers and researchers. Through powerful    coalitions we will strive to accelerate the change we need to build a sustainable future. That means strongly embracing and investing in our and others' most effective solutions to the crucial challenges facing the planet. And we must mobilize hundreds of millions from all corners of the world, to join forces and make their voices heard for a better future. We have reached a fork in the road. This generation has a huge opportunity to build a sustainable future for all, and momentum is on our side. But the situation could still go either way. There has never been a stronger sense of urgency for action. In WWF we are defining new ways of working to make a difference at a scale that matters. We know we must redefine humanity's relationship with the planet. We passionately believe we can. And we will.

Across six continents, six conservation priorities unite us.   CLIMATE AND ENERGY A GLOBAL SHIFT TOWARD A LOW-CARBON AND CLIMATE-RESILIENT FUTURE IS ACHIEVED Combating climate change requires a rapid shift away from fossil fuels toward clean energy: a record-breaking US$367 billion was invested in renewable energy globally in 2015.   In Paris in December, 195 countries signed up to an unprecedented global agreement to combat climate change -- the culmination of years of advocacy work by WWF and others through the United Nations climate change process. 1.5°C The Paris Agreement promises efforts to limit average global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We were one of the first organizations to advocate this more ambitious target and were delighted that it was included in the final agreement. While current government pledges fall well short of what's needed to stay below 1.5°C, cities and businesses are beginning to pick up the slack. 1,000 cities committed to 100 per cent renewable energy and/or to 80 per cent greenhouse gas reductions by 2050, while more than 100 major businesses promised emissions reductions in line with science, as part of the WWF-supported Science-Based Targets Initiative.   2009 The Copenhagen conference ends in disappointment as governments fail to reach a new climate deal.   Countries will come back to the table to review and update their commitments in line with the 1.5-2°C goal. 20Emissions need to peak by this date for a reasonable chance of keeping below 1.5°C of warming. All countries must submit long-term low-emission development strategies and new or updated climate change targets for 2030. 2020 Current emissions targets for 2030 are 35 per cent too high, so they urgently need to be strengthened. 20WWF and many others are calling for 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050 with fossil fuel use completely phased out in a just transition. 202013 At the climate talks in Warsaw, frustrated by the lack of progress and the influence of polluting industries, WWF and other civil society organizations walk out in protest.  20All countries sign up to a global climate deal that aims to limit temperature rise to well below 2°C, while pursuing efforts to keep below 1.5°C; 186 countries submit voluntary climate action plans to the UN. The Paris Agreement incorporates several key WWF priorities: EMISSIONS Greenhouse-gas emissions should peak ""as soon as possible"". All countries are called upon to develop long-term low-emission development plans and to update their climate change efforts every five years in line with the latest science, while an action platform is established to bring forward urgent action. FINANCE In addition to rich government providing US$100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020, all have to ensure systemic change by ""shifting the trillions""; they have to also finance the energy transition, protect forests and other ecosystems, and support the most vulnerable. CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS A Global Goal on Adaptation seeks to strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change, while a standalone article on Loss and Damage helps to safeguard vulnerable people and ecosystems when adaptation is not possible. ECOSYSTEMS The text highlighted the importance of ecosystems, including ­ for the first time ­ the ocean, in climate mitigation and adaptation, and loss and damage from the impacts of climate change.   OCEANS THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT FISHERIES AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE PRODUCTIVE AND RESILIENT, AND IMPROVE LIVELIHOODS AND BIODIVERSITY Belizean kids show off their grandfather's catch. 17,000 people working in the Belize fisheries industry use the income to support their families.   US$2.5 TRILLION Our report Reviving the Ocean Economy helped spur international commitments to protect the ocean. The research showed that, if the ocean were a country, it would be the world's seventh largest economy, with a monetary value of at least US$2.5 trillion a year -- but this value will fall without strong action to stop the erosion of its underpinning assets. Leaders and influencers used our analysis prominently during 2015. -49% This year's special marine edition of the Living Planet Report highlighted the shocking decline in marine species. Populations of marine vertebrates have fallen by almost half since 1970, with some of the most important fish species for regional economies, food and livelihoods declining even more. The report raised the profile of vital ocean conservation issues. GOAL 14 In September, all governments committed to ""Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, sea and marine resources"" as one of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals; a historic outcome. The ocean also featured in the Paris climate agreement.   In 2015, our global marine campaign put the future of the ocean in the spotlight. Around the world, WWF is helping to turn the tide.  10 MILLION A DAY The ocean was a big story in 2015, reaching up to 10 million people a day during major launches: the reach on Facebook was about 4.6 million and other social media channels also featured strongly. Our reports received over 1,700 media hits across 76 countries in 32 languages in top outlets including Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, The Hindu, Xinhua, Deutsche Welle, Reuters, The Bangkok Post and many more. The potential collective reach was over a billion people. But it wasn't just about the numbers; the campaign messages were consistently referenced by global opinion-shapers like the World Economic Forum and The Economist, by the leadership of the influential Small Island Developing States bloc, and leaders from the US and the EU, among others. 10 GOVERNMENTS After two years of hard work by WWF and partners, the 10 parties to the Nairobi Convention have agreed to develop a new integrated management approach in the Northern Mozambique Channel ­ a rich marine area that's vital for the livelihoods and food security of 10 million people, but faces threats from oil and gas exploitation, unsustainable and illegal fishing, and destructive development.    Protecting 30 per cent of marine and coastal areas could generate US$490-920 billion and 150,000-180,000 full-time jobs between now and 2050, according to research we published last year. Globally, marine protected areas cover only about 4 per cent of the ocean, but this is growing: 2015 brought significant advances, with countries including Madagascar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Chile, the United States and the Pacific island nation of Kiribati announcing major new protection for waters under their jurisdiction. Our campaign aimed to further boost this coverage by showing how investment in ocean protection pays high dividends to people, nature and economies.  543,723 PEOPLE FOR THE REEF Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared from the threat of huge volumes of dredge spoil being dumped within its waters. Australia committed to introduce a permanent ban on dumping, following a global WWF campaign including a petition which attracted 543,723 supporters. The World Heritage Committee has put the Australian government on ""probation"" until the health of the reef improves, while a number of banks have backed out of financing new coal terminals near the reef.   WILDLIFE THE WORLD'S MOST ICONIC AND THREATENED SPECIES ARE SECURED AND RECOVERING IN THE WILD African elephant dust bathing in Amboseli National Park, Kenya. The illegal ivory trade remains a major threat to Africa's elephants.   +17% In February, the Chinese government announced a 17 per cent rise in the giant panda population over the last decade. Meanwhile, wild tigers are on the rise for the first time in 100 years. The global total was revised up to 3,890 from as few as 3,200 in 2010 due to improved monitoring and population increases in India, Russia, Nepal and Bhutan. Asia's greater one-horned rhino numbers also rose to more than 3,500. FIRST In July, all 193 member states adopted the first-ever UN General Assembly resolution against wildlife crime. WWF played a key role, and the final text incorporated all our major asks. Despite another terrible year for poaching of African elephants and rhinos, there were signs of progress on the ground, with Nepal celebrating its third year since 2011 of zero poaching of rhinos. 1.3 MILLION Our campaign to reduce demand for ivory in Thailand garnered the support of 1.3 million Thais and the backing of celebrities, artists and government officials. It coincided with the government regulating the domestic ivory market for the first time. Meanwhile, the Chinese and US presidents announced plans to phase out their domestic ivory markets, as did the chief executive of Hong Kong following a WWF campaign backed by over 70,000 people.   FORESTS THE INTEGRITY OF THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT FORESTS, INCLUDING THEIR BENEFITS TO HUMAN WELL-BEING, IS ENHANCED AND MAINTAINED A misty morning in Kika, Cameroon. The Congo Basin holds the second-largest rainforest in the world, but millions of hectares will be destroyed over the next 15 years without urgent action to protect and manage forest landscapes sustainably.   11 DEFORESTATION FRONTS Just 11 places account for more than 80 per cent of projected deforestation up to 2030 ­ a total of more than 180 million hectares ­ according to research collected in our Living Forests Report. 99% The Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) Programme, which aims to protect and sustainably manage 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon, has reached almost 99 per cent of its target with the inclusion of six new protected areas. We worked with the government of Brazil and other partners including the World Bank, GEF and German Development Bank to launch ARPA in 2002. FORESTS AND CLIMATE The Paris climate agreement echoed WWF's position by highlighting the importance of ending deforestation, with tropical forest countries, donor countries, private sector companies and civil society promising new efforts to conserve and restore forests and the carbon they contain.   WATER FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND FLOW REGIMES IN KEY RIVER BASINS PROVIDE WATER FOR PEOPLE AND NATURE A fisherman casts his net in the shallow lakes of the Várzea, a seasonal floodplain forest in the Brazilian Amazon. Wetlands and freshwater ecosystems provide food, clean water and other vital services that people and nature depend on.   20 MILLION HECTARES At the Ramsar conference in June, the governments of Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay made a joint commitment to conserve and sustainably manage the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland. The 20-million hectare ecosystem -- almost the size of Great Britain ­ is a priority for WWF. 120,000 + Companies and financial institutions have used our Water Risk Filter to assess more than 120,000 facilities in river basins all over the world. The tool, newly updated in 2015 to cover all industries and more than 120 commodities, enables users to easily understand their specific water risks and take action to mitigate them (waterriskfilter.org). 10 The International Hydropower Association outlined 10 commitments to make the industry more sustainable. This included calling on the industry to use the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol, which WWF helped develop. Using the tool will minimize the negative impacts of dams on communities and freshwater ecosystems.   FOOD SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS CONSERVE NATURE AND MAINTAIN FOOD SECURITY A field ready for planting sugarcane in Queensland, Australia. WWF has been working with cane farmers in the region to reduce the run-off of water and chemicals onto the Great Barrier Reef.   9 BILLION By 2050, more than 9 billion people will share the planet, and the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization forecasts that demand for food could increase by up to 70 per cent. The way we produce our food has a huge impact on the natural world, and is a leading driver of deforestation, water scarcity, climate change and biodiversity loss. 20% A fifth of all palm oil is now certified to the standards of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), meaning it doesn't contribute to deforestation. The RSPO is one of several certification schemes WWF has helped set up to promote sustainable food commodities. Others include the Marine Stewardship Council, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, the Round Table on Sustainable Soy and Bonsucro for sugarcane. 30% Livestock production has a huge impact on the planet, occupying around 30 per cent of all land and emitting 18 per cent of global greenhouse gases. We're promoting responsible production and changes in consumption of beef and dairy products. One recent success was the approval of principles and criteria for the Global Roundtable on Sustainable Beef.   PARTNERSHIPS   What we do is only possible thanks to the support of many partners in the public sector, private sector and civil society, including our donors and those who campaign and act with us. We're grateful to all those who have worked with us over the past year.   PUBLIC SECTOR PARTNERSHIPS  During 2015, all nations on Earth committed to a shared agenda for sustainable development and action on climate change. The commitment and leadership of WWF's public sector partners have been crucial. Now the focus is on bringing together governments, development partners, private sector and civil society to build partnerships, develop solutions and turn commitments into reality.  ""We will advance fully towards an equitable global economic system in which no country or person is left behind, enabling decent work and productive livelihoods for all, while preserving the planet for our children and future generations."" ­ From the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted by the world's governments on 15 July 2015, which will guide public finance, trade and private investment toward sustainable development. WWF was closely involved in the process, and we were pleased to see our environmental priorities figured highly. ""The Addis Ababa Action Agenda is a significant achievement toward financing a sustainable development agenda in a holistic manner, one that recognizes the connection between economic prosperity, social development and environmental protection,"" said Céline Beaulieu, WWF's Head of Delegation at the conference. ""This is an important step forward in securing the resources needed to eradicate poverty and help countries develop sustainably. Ultimately, success will be determined by mobilization by all toward action and implementation.""  Partnerships  Following the Addis Ababa conference, governments endorsed the Post-2015 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals in September, and reconvened to reach an accord on climate change in Paris in December. We'll work with our public sector partners to influence national plans and budgets to implement these goals, and set clear and measurable targets that can mobilize the billions required to leverage further trillions of capital investment toward sustainable, low-carbon and resilient development.  ""Resilient economies can only be created by supporting people and ecosystems through a change in mindset. New finance for development and climate must be delivered transparently. Funding mechanisms need to prioritize low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sound development solutions that respect human rights."" Tim Geer, Director, Public Sector Partnerships WWF International   TOGETHER WITH BUSINESS  Business has a huge impact on the natural world ­ but also has the potential to be a major part of the solution. Only by engaging with responsible business we can tackle issues like climate change, water scarcity, overfishing and deforestation.  Key areas we work on: Better production and responsible sourcing of raw materials Renewable energy Water stewardship Influencing public policy Equitable sharing of natural resources  Redirecting financial flows to support conservation  Raising awareness of the need to consume more wisely  Protecting special places   Transparency around who we work with is important to WWF. We publish an annual Global Corporate Partnerships Report on our largest international partnerships, and report on an office basis on our local/national partnerships. Jointly, these tell the story of all our partnerships with companies, large or small. Please see    Partnerships  CLIMATE CHANGE Our corporate partners have already made significant cuts in their greenhouse-gas emissions, and have made bold commitments to embrace renewable energy and cut emissions on an unprecedented scale. Business leaders were among the strongest voices urging governments to agree an ambitious climate deal. Among the many announcements made by leading companies as part of WWF-backed initiatives during the Paris conference:   COMMODITIES Unsustainable production of commodities like palm oil, paper, soy and seafood drives deforestation, water scarcity, biodiversity loss, climate change and other threats to the natural world. But a relatively small number of companies have it in their power to transform global markets and make sustainable production the norm. Of our ""top 100"" priority companies:  66 have made credible, time-bound commitments to source at least one key certified sustainable commodity. 76 are members of a multi-stakeholder roundtable, which is a first step toward sustainable sourcing. 25 have strategic partnerships with WWF that aim to transform their supply chain.  WATER STEWARDSHIP Water stewardship is about committing to sustainable management of shared water resources in the public interest. We support our business partners to progressively improve their water use, reduce their water-related impacts and take collective action to secure freshwater supplies for people and nature.  1 The World Economic Forum ranks water crises as the number 1 risk to business for the next 10 years. 130 WWF has 130 corporate partners working on freshwater issues ­ our fastest growing conservation topic.  7 Last year we engaged with seven global industry associations and many other multilateral organizations on water issues.    OUR DONORS  US$100 million raised thanks to the commitment and generosity of our many partners and donors. We are delighted to announce that we have reached our fundraising target of US$100 million for our Campaign for a Living Planet. Over the past five years, this campaign has been our worldwide call to action to protect the planet's most remarkable species and places and tackle humanity's footprint on Earth. We are grateful to all of our donors ­ from individuals to foundations to corporate partners ­ who have supported the campaign and are helping us build a future in which people live in harmony with nature. As ever we are thankful for the inspiring leadership and support of the chair of the Campaign for a Living Planet Steering Committee, André Hoffmann, and to other committee members for their active involvement. Together, our efforts have been rewarded with this inspirational sum raised. WWF International has four levels of partnership and engagement: the Honorary Circle, Conservation Leaders, Conservation Champions and Conservation Partners. We would like to thank and recognize all of our donors who have provided leadership and generous funding support for our conservation work.  Honorary Circle We thank the Hoffmann family who, through the MAVA Foundation, have generously supported many global programmes, such as our marine, climate, protected areas and freshwater work, specifically in the Mediterranean, Greater Mekong, China, Mongolia, Europe and West Africa. MAVA has also supported the development of our core fundraising team and the closing stages of our Campaign for a Living Planet, and renewed their support for the Luc Hoffmann Institute. Miel de Botton provides ongoing support to our Campaign for a Living Planet Leadership Fund as well as WWF's marine work and our global climate and policy work, with a particular focus on China. Nomis Stiftung has generously supported the Luc Hoffmann Institute's LIVES project, which is conducting basic research to develop riskanalysis metrics for complex systems involving food, energy, water and the economy. A fullscale pilot project for this innovative approach is currently being tested in the Mekong river basin in Cambodia. Kristian Parker and Oak Foundation is a critical funder of our global campaign to secure some of the planet's most treasured places by eliminating or transforming threats to World Heritage sites and the communities that depend on them. Oak Foundation also continues its longstanding commitment to our youth volunteer programme Explore! Through Fondation Segré, Dr Claudio Segré has generously supported WWF and TRAFFIC's global action plan against poaching and illegal wildlife trade to enhance protection for threatened species, address demand reduction and elevate the profile of wildlife crime at the highest levels. Fondation Segré is also supporting WWF to implement an ambitious model of  marine protected area management in Indonesia and the Philippines to address the loss of marine biodiversity, enhance food security and reverse the declining food sources and livelihoods in the Coral Triangle. Pierrette Schlettwein continues to generously support WWF and TRAFFIC's work to combat wildlife crime by tackling poaching, stopping illegal trafficking and reducing demand for wildlife products to secure a future for endangered species. One Honorary Circle member who wishes to remain anonymous continues to generously support our Tigers Alive Initiative. Throughout  the Terai Arc landscape in India and Nepal we have managed to increase protection in some priority tiger sites. Together we aim to create the largest connected tiger population in the world and ensure the Conservation Assured Tiger Standard (CA/TS) is adopted worldwide and wild tigers double by 2022. Another Honorary Circle member who prefers to remain anonymous has provided WWF with the core funding to develop and grow the Living Himalayas Initiative to conserve the rich biodiversity and sensitive mountain landscapes across Bhutan, India and Nepal.  Conservation Leaders We are very grateful for the generous support of our Conservation Leaders, who help us achieve conservation impact through funding their programmes of interest, and who also reach out to their personal, business and philanthropic networks to increase awareness of WWF's work.  TO BE UPDATED With as few as 4,000 snow leopards left, we launched our first global action plan for the endangered species in 2015. In Mongolia, WWF teams collared four of the elusive big cats, while in India we provided livestock pens to farmers to reduce humanleopard conflict and retaliatory killings.   TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE  WWF connects with millions of people all over the world. Whether through reports and stories in the media, or web campaigns and Twitter hashtags, we raise awareness and interest around the issues that matter for the planet, and inspire people to act. Their support makes our voice powerful and our work possible.  INSPIRE EARTH HOUR Earth Hour, the world's largest grassroots movement for the environment, went from strength to strength to shine a light on climate action. Millions of people across seven continents, and even the crew aboard the International Space Station, turned out their lights for an hour in a show of solidarity to tackle our planet's biggest environmental challenge yet ­ climate change. Many individuals, governments, cities, businesses, schools and institutions went further, supporting local campaigns, fundraising initiatives and actions initiated by WWF teams to change climate change.  NEWS  WWF was featured in more than 70,000 media stories worldwide.  WAVES OF SUPPORT Our global ocean campaign really took off on digital media. We reached 500,000 people each day on average and up to 10 million a day during major launches. Influential institutions and leaders consistently promoted our ocean infographics and messages ­ there were more than 53,000 mentions on Twitter alone.  ENDANGERED EMOJI Emoji is becoming a universal language, used millions of times every day. In May we launched a unique emoji-based campaign after discovering that 17 characters in the emoji alphabet represent endangered species. Twitter users who signed up to the #EndangeredEmoji campaign made a small donation each time they used one of the endangered emoji in a Tweet. As well as raising funds, it was a fun and simple way of taking our message to a new audience. 62,900 sign-ups 815,000 mentions  #CHANGECLIMATECHANGE We helped bring the voice of the people to the Paris climate talks. Our Tweet Your Leader campaign enabled people from any country to send a Tweet directly to their head of government, urging action on climate change. 800 million impressions for the campaign hashtag #ChangeClimateChange   The Rufiji River runs through Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, one of the world's largest wildlife sanctuaries. This World Heritage site is threatened by more than 50 oil, gas and mining concessions as well as hydropower and infrastructure development. During 2016, we're campaigning for stronger support for natural World Heritage sites, which make a crucial contribution to sustainable development.    WWF Network Total WWF Network income increased by 5 per cent, with an increase of EUR35 million to EUR692 million. Expenditure grew by 7 per cent (EUR46 million), mainly due to increased spending in conservation programmes (up 9 per cent). The resulting surplus of EUR18 million will be used to fund our ongoing projects and programmes, and help us to reach our conservation targets.

WWF-2016-4.txt,"  15 SIGNALS EVIDENCE THE ENERGY TRANSITION IS UNDERWAY   FOREWORD World leaders approved a universal climate agreement in Paris last year, drawing a line in the sand for the transformation of the world's energy system into a clean and sustainable form. Signs that a global energy transition is happening are everywhere to be seen: in the growth of renewables, the rise of city-level climate actions, the stagnation of CO2 emissions and in companies who are committing to science based targets as the foundation of their climate actions, to name just a few. We felt it important to highlight 15 key signs or ""signals"" of the energy transition, to help raise awareness that the transition to a new, sustainable, equitable, just and fair global energy system has irrevocably begun. What is needed now is to accelerate the transition and scale it up to have a chance of keeping global temperature rise to well below 2°C, trying for 1.5°C, as countries committed to in the Paris Agreement just eight months ago. Global meetings ­ such as the G20 meeting taking place in China on 4-5th September; and the next UN climate talks starting in Marrakech on 7th November ­ gives opportunity to all stakeholders to say how and what they can contribute to accelerating the transition. Ending fossil fuel subsidies, supporting the deployment of renewables and energy efficiency, increasing green finance and putting a just price on carbon are just some of the actions that can be taken right now to put pace into the transition. As 2016 heads into the record books as likely the hottest year ever recorded in history, it is a reminder that we have precious little time left to act to keep global temperatures well below 2°C. We have the Paris Agreement to guide our way. Now we need to implement it. Now is the time for action. RENEWABLE ENERGY  Renewables accounted for 90 per cent new electricity generation globally in 2015, while contributing to half of it the year before. (Source : Share of new electricity generation by renewables in the world, estimated by IEA.)  Based on its analysis of preliminary data for the global CO2 energy emissions data for 2015, the International Energy Agency showed that power generated by renewables is playing a growing role in slowing down energy related CO2 emissions as they accounted for around 90 per cent of new electricity generation in 2015. Wind power alone produced more than half of it. This share by renewables has seen an exponential increase in the last years, from 50 per cent in 2014, to 90 per cent of new power nowadays. On the road through COP21, renewables are known to be a tipping point that needs to be amplified, especially by replacing old fossil fuel power plants with renewables.  SOLAR TECHNOLOGY COSTS DROPPING  Solar PV technologies electricity generation costs have decreased by more than 80 per cent  since 2009. It is forecast to continue falling by up to 59 per cent in 2025, making solar PV the  cheapest form of power generation.  (Source: IRENA 2016, The Power to Change: Solar and Wind Cost Reduction Potential to 2025) According to the International Renewables Energy Agency (IRENA), solar PV module prices present from 18 per cent to 22 per cent learning rates and rapid deployment with around 40 per cent growth in cumulative installed capacity in each 2012 and 2013, and around 30 per cent in 2014 and 2015. This led to a decline of 80 per cent in PV module prices between 2009 and 2015. This created a buyer's market that could be spurred in the coming years with the right policy measures. INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLES SOARING  Global investments in renewable generation hit a new world record, with US$286 billion invested in 2015 , more than double dollar allocations to new coal and gas generation. Since 2013 more renewable power capacity has been installed annually around the world than fossil and nuclear together.  (Source : IRENA, 2014-2015)  According to REN21, total global investments in renewable power and fuels reached a new record in 2015 with US$285.9 billion* invested. This represents a 5 per cent increase compared to 2014 and exceeds the previous record of US$279 billion reached in 2011. Global investment in new renewable power capacity was more than double the US$130 billion allocated to new coal- and natural gas-fired power generation capacity. Among top investments, solar technologies accounted in total for US$161 billion investments ­ with a 12 per cent growth compared to 2014 ­ and wind for US$109 billion ­ with a 4 per cent growth compared to 2014. Biggest country investors include China, US, Japan, the UK and India. INCREASING NUMBER OF COUNTRIES RUNNING TOTALLY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY  On the 8th of May 2016, renewables supplied Germany almost all its power demand, marking a milestone in its ""energiewende"".  In 2015, renewables in Germany accounted for 32.6 per cent of gross domestic power consumption. The country targets a minimum of 50 per cent renewables in this field by 2030. As the current level of coal in the mix remains a problem to be solved for Germany, the country ranks among world champions in the deployment of renewable technologies, being the second country in the world with total renewable power capacity per capita. On the 8th of May 2016, renewables supplied 87.6 per cent of domestic electricity consumption due to extremely favourable weather conditions leading to negative electricity prices. This symbolic moment illustrates the powerful energy transition happening in Germany: ``Agora Energiewende''. Other countries with a high share of renewables such as Portugal, Denmark and Cost Rica have also succeeded in reaching almost a full supply power demand from renewables. In Portugal, all renewables provided 48% of its electricity in 2015 according the Portuguese renewable energy association.  JOBS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY INCREASING  Renewable energy employment hit a record in 2015, with 8.1 million jobs recorded. (Source: IRENA 2016 Renewable Energy and Jobs)  According to IRENA, global renewable energy employment increased by 5 per cent in 2015 to reach 8.1 million. In contrast to other depressed labour markets, total number of jobs in renewables worldwide continued to rise. Solar PV was the highest employer with 2.8 million jobs globally, followed by liquid biofuels and wind energy. Asia accounts for 60 per cent jobs worldwide. The top five with jobs in renewables are China, the EU, Brazil, the US and India.  United States  CHINA IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST INVESTOR IN RENEWABLES  Chinese investments in renewables increased by 17 per cent to US$103 billion ­ making it again world's leading champion in renewables. (Sources: REN21 Global Status Report 2016)   China ranks as the world's leader in total renewables capacity, according to the REN21 annual report; in investment in renewables capacity (topping 80 US$102.9 billion by 2015) and in solar PV, solar water heating, wind and geothermal power. It is also the largest employer in renewables, with a total 60 of 3.5 million jobs. Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Spain and Portugal are the top five countries in terms of renewables if we look the numbers in terms of 40 total renewable power capacity per capita.  However, in 2015, the annual wind power curtailment in China reached 33.9 billion kilowatts-hour, with an average rate of 15 per cent. In the first half of 2016, it reached a record high level of 21 per cent, which shows that the current managing mechanism and infrastructure of China's power sector does not match the speedy investment in renewable energy.   AFRICA IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST MARKET FOR OFF GRID SOLAR PRODUCTS  Sub-Saharan Africa was the largest market for off grid solar products in the world with 1.37 million units.  (Sources: REN21, Global Status Report, 2016)  Sub-Saharan Africa hit 1.37 million units sold in off grid solar in 2015. Despite this record, access to clean energy remains one of the main challenges for the region in the next year. 53 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to electricity. Meanwhile, the African region is part of the Africa Renewables Energy Initiative (AREI) that aims to target a 10GW renewables capacity by 2020 and 300GW by 2030. As the end of 2014, four sub-Saharan countries were particularly leading in the global top five countries with their number of solar lighting systems: Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda.   GREEN BONDS GROWING  The green bonds market grew at an impressive compound growth rate, from close to zero in 2007 to an outstanding US$118 billion by mid-2016. (Sources: WWF, Green Bonds must keep the green promise!, June 2016; and Speech of MA Jun, Chief Economist of People's Bank of China; Climate Bond Initiative; Bloomberg New Energy Finance)  Green bonds are attractively simple structures, offering investors  additional disclosure and accountability and providing a means to  ring fence funds for investments in sustainable agriculture, energy-  efficient buildings, clean energy, industry and transportation,  water and waste, even biodiversity conservation, to name just a few  2016 estimate: $100 bn  investment fields. By mid-2016 the market amounted to US$118 billion of outstanding bonds labelled as green or climate aligned. More recently, China adding significant momentum to this global trend. In December 2015, the People's Bank of China released ""Green Financial Bonds  $40 bn $30 bn  Bank Corporate ABS Muni Development Bank  Bulletin"", which defines the first standard for green bond in China $20 bn  and helped unlock the potential of the Chinese market. During  the first quarter of 2016 alone, China had issued US$ 8.2 billion of green bonds, which accounts for half of new issuances of green $10 bn  bonds worldwide. The green bond market bears great potential  for the future and can help to accelerate the energy transition to $0 bn  keep global temperature increase well below 2°C, but still needs standards to address all major and sustainability challenges.   SCIENCE BASED TARGETS TO PUT BUSINESS ON A BELOW 2°C TRAJECTORY  More than 170 large companies, including energy intensive ones, signed on to adopt science based targets.  (Sources: CDP, The Business End of Climate Change: How corporate action supported by smart policy can keep temperature rise below 2°C, 2016)   The Science Based Targets initiative, run by WWF, CDP, WRI and the UN Global Compact, invites companies to set their emissions targets in line with keeping climate change well below 2°C. Partners assumed that 2,000 companies will be setting Science Based Targets by 2030. As of August 1st 2016, 176 large companies have committed to doing this, and 18 have already had their targets reviewed and approved. The initiative also aims to lift corporate ambition and help businesses pursue bolder solutions to climate change.   CHINA'S COAL CONSUMPTION MAY BE PEAKING  China may have already reached a coal consumption peak. (Sources : China Energy Statistical Yearbook 2014 China National Economic and Social Development Statistics Bulletin 2015) China accounts for nearly half of the world's coal consumption, the coal dependence makes China the biggest carbon emitter globally. This has caused severe air pollution and other environmental problems domestically. Along with the slowing down of China's economic growth and the Chinese government's effort to restructure its industries, China's coal consumption has been in decline since 2014 with a 3.7 per cent drop in 2015.  COAL INDUSTRY DECLINING  The coal industry faces declining prices and higher costs leading to some bankruptcies.  (Sources: WWF, Megatrends in the global energy transition, December 2015 Sierra Club and CoalSwarm, Boom and Bust: Tracking the global coal plant pipeline, 2015 and 2016 reports)  In order to hold temperature increase below 2°C, two thirds of fossil fuels proven reserves must stay in the ground. There are increasing signs that the unrestricted burning of environmentally damaging fuels is also reaching its limits in the real world. Since 2010, two out of three planned coal power plants have been put on the back burner or completely abandoned and only one finally completed. The parallel collapse in the use of coal in China, Europe and the USA in recent years combined with signs of coal market decline will soon have global impact, on emissions as well as on the industry. In 2016, US mining giant Peabody Energy, which used to be the world largest private coal company, filed for bankruptcy. In total, coal-based US companies which filed for bankruptcy in 2016 lost $30 billion USD in stock-market-value since 2010. In 2015, a report by Wood Mackezie found that 33 per cent of coal mines in Queensland (Australia) were running at a loss, including 50 per cent of thermal coal mines. In China, coal production dropped dramatically by 9.7 per cent in the first half of 2016.   GLOBAL CO2 EMISSIONS FROM ENERGY STALLING  Global energy related carbon dioxide emissions stalled for the second year in a row in 2015, despite a 3 per cent economic growth. (Source: International Energy Agency, Global energy-related CO2 emissions data, 2016.)  In its preliminary global CO2 energy emissions data in 2016, the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed that global emissions from energy stood at 32.1 billion tons in 2015, following a flat trend for the second year in a row. The link between the global economy, which continued to grow, and energy related emissions growth is therefore weakening. Improvements in energy efficiency, a spur in renewables led by wind as well as the decline of coal use in the two biggest world emitters are advanced by IEA as the main drivers of this trend.   ENERGY INTENSITY IMPROVING  The decline in annual global energy intensity accelerated to more than 1.7 per cent on 2010 to 2012, but needs to go much faster to meet 2030 sustainable development goals. (Sources: Sustainable Energy for All 2015: Progress Toward Sustainable Energy)  The improvement of energy efficiency and energy savings constitute a critical pillar of the energy transition. Global efforts on this matter can be tracked through energy intensity which connects economic growth with energy use. According to Sustainable Energy for All, progress in improving primary energy intensity (units of energy per unit of GDP) has led to a 1.7 per cent decline a year over 2010-2012 (World Bank 2013). It is a better rate than the previous decade but it is still not enough to meet the Sustainable Energy for All goal of 2.6 per cent a year. This recent trend was primarily driven by high-income countries (from 1.5 per cent a year from 2000 to 2010 to 2.6 percent from 2010 to 2012).  CITIES RISING TO CLIMATE CHALLENGE  (Sources: UNEP, Climate commitment of subnational actors and business, 2015)  Cities are at the forefront of climate action. Towards COP21, hundreds of local governments joined their forces to launch initiatives and networks to advance their contribution to fight climate change and accelerate action: like the C40, the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) or the Carbonn Climate Registry (cCR). According to UNEP, the total achievements of additional emission reductions of these three city level initiatives is expected to reach 1.08GtCO2e by 2020 as compared to a current policy scenario. In addition, cities networks and 700 mayors declared their intention to strengthen their efforts to reach a 3.7GtCO2 annual reduction by 2030 in urban areas. From 2010 to 2015, the ICLEI Carbonn Climate Registery reporting plateform recorded 1 681 actions on concrete action plans already implemented by 600 cities and regions in 62 countries to fight climate change. These communities represent 8 per cent of the world population.  FORECASTS AND REALITY  Overachievements: comparing projections done by international energy outlooks for global  expansion of renewables with reality shows that international agencies have underestimated the  potential of these technologies. (Sources: WWF, Megatrends in the global energy transition, 2015 Matthieu Metayer, Christian Breyer, Hans-Josef Fell, The projections for the future and quality in the past of the World Energy Outlook for solar PV and other renewable energy technologies, 22.09.2015) So far, institutional outlooks have totally underestimated the deployment of renewables and their future spread. For instance, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has missed in its projections the renewables boom for decades, only being able to adjust its forecasts on the expansion of renewables in relation to the existing developments. These misleading results have been shown in a recent WWF report (Megatrends in the global energy transition, 2015). Greenpeace and Global Wind Energy Council forecasts were the only one close to reality for renewables. Renewables can be seen as disruptive innovations with the potential to completely replace established products in existing markets or even whole sectors of industry.    A just, fair and equitable energy transition Why does WWF advocate for a just energy transition? The energy transition is happening ­ this report shows some signs of this change ­ and is an unstoppable long-term trend. This energy transition, as many other historical transitions, is based in the change in market forces due to technological innovations. We witness a destructive creation, new adopted and adapted technologies shaping a key market for the economy: the energy market. The energy transition has multiple effects. As energy is a basic input for all production processes, this change impacts many other fields of the economy and is reshaping our societies. WWF advocates for this transition to be accelerated to avoid dangerous global warming that could have huge impacts in nature and humankind. In a creative destruction process there are always winners and losers and accelerating this process might increase the transition tensions. Addressing the transition negative impacts, particularly those in the most vulnerable sectors of society is a must, in line with the recently adopted UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Current global energy systems are not just. First, billions of people live without access to clean and reliable sources of energy. Second, low income households spend a larger proportion of their income on energy services [than higher income households] hindering opportunities to accumulate the needed wealth to escape from poverty. These two elements of energy poverty subsequently bring about other serious problems such as gender inequity, social injustice and environmental degradation. WWF's mission ``to stop the degratation of the planet's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature'' embraces the spirit behind the SDGs to align the human footprint with what science dictates for sustainability. Making the energy transition equitable and fair contributes to build up human harmony with nature. However, our approach is not only about making just the transition, but enhancing the possibilities of transforming the future energy system in one that founds a more equitable society. The characteristics of the innovative energy technologies allow the new energy system to be more distributed, interdependent, less centralized and interactive. These features open the alternative to a more economically balanced system. The just energy transition cannot be just about the transition.  WWF ASKS ON CLIMATE AND ENERGY FOR G20 The G20 Heads of State have committed to stronger engagement and cooperation to fight climate change in several declarations since 2008, notably by eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels. The adoption of the Paris Agreement and decisions and of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015 offer unique opportunities to align G20 actions with commitments under the Paris Agreement and integrate climate related goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda in G20 work streams. WWF welcomes the G20's efforts to implement climate pledges, notably through the activity of the study group on Climate Finance, and other groups working on stronger consensus among G20 members to integrate environmental aspects in their deliberations, such as the G20 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the Green Finance Study Group (GFSG). WWF also strongly supports efforts at eliminating fossil fuels subsidies, welcomes progress to date and urges elimination by 2020. WWF fully supports the Chinese Presidency's call for G20 members to ""take active measures to implement the outcomes of the COP21 on climate financing and others"". WWF also welcomes the Chinese Presidency's call to ""strengthen cooperation on energy access, renewable energy and energy efficiency to ensure green, balanced and sustainable development"".   At the G20 Hangzhou Summit, WWF asks the G20 to help the global transition to renewables energy by: · Recognizing the COP21 outcomes, including the Paris Agreement and decisions and connecting commitments with G20 work on infrastructure, investment and financial sector reform and energy access; · Supporting the ongoing work by the FSB Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and integrate the upcoming outcomes with the aim to detail further steps on how the financial sector can take account of climate change risks; · Recognizing that environmental and social risk impact economic and financial stability; · Recognizing the need for credible, fully developed and widely accepted standards for green bonds so as ensure consistency and comparability of such standards, including standardised terms and definitions, standardised disclosure, standardised certification requirements, the integration of green considerations into credit ratings, and credible dispute-resolution mechanisms · Ensuring all possible support including fiscal and economic tools to reliable, safe, sustainable and clean energy access for all by 2030, notably by: z Developing an inventory of fossil fuel subsidies of all G20 member states with harmonised metrics and agreeing ambitious phase-out road-maps by 2018 in order to completely and equitably phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020 and reinforce this process by `third country' peer-reviews; z Making energy efficiency and renewable energy an infrastructure investment priority for the Investment and Infrastructure Working Group; z Upgrading the Green Finance Study Group to a permanent Working Group to help green financial investments globally; "
